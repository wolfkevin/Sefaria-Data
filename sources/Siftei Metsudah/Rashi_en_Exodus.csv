Exodus 2:1,"1And married the daughter of Levi. He (Amram) had separated from her due to Pharaoh’s decree and he [now] took her back and married her a second time. She, too, became youthful again. [Actually] she was 130 years old, for she was born upon their arrival in Egypt between the walls (the entrance of the city). They then spent 210 years there (in Egypt). When they left, Moshe was 80 years old. Thus, when she became pregnant with him she was 130 [years old]. [Yet,] she is referred to as “the daughter of Levi.” "
Exodus 3:1,1To the edge of the wilderness. In order to distance himself from theft whereby [the sheep] will not graze in others’ fields. To the mountain of God. So called because of what was destined to occur there. 
Exodus 4:2,"2“What is that in your hand?” [מַה זֶה] is written as one word so that it can be explained: “From that which is in your hand you deserve to be punished, for you were suspicious of righteous people.” The plain meaning of it is as a person who says to his friend, “Do you agree that the item before you is a stone?” “Yes,” he responds. “Well, watch as I turn it into wood.” "
Exodus 5:1,"1Afterwards Moshe and Aharon went, etc. But the elders slipped away one by one from behind Moshe and Aharon, until they had all slipped away before they reached the palace, for they were afraid to go. They received their retribution at Sinai: “Moshe, alone, drew near to Adonoy but they (the elders) did not draw near.” [for] He (God) made them turn back. "
Exodus 6:1,"1Now you will see, etc. “You have questioned My ways, not as Avraham, to whom I said, ‘for through Yitzchok will you have descendants,’ and afterwards, I said to him, ‘Bring him up as an olah sacrifice,’ yet, he did not question My ways. Therefore: “Now you will see. Only that which will be done to Pharaoh will you see, but not which will be done to the kings of the seven nations when I bring them (Yisrael) to the land. For by [My] strong hand he will let them go. [Meaning:] “Due to My strong hand which will overpower Pharaoh will he let them go.And by a strong hand he will drive them from his land. He will drive them out against their will so that they will not have a chance to prepare provisions [for the journey]. And so it is said: “The Egyptians pressed the people” — to hurry and send them away."
Exodus 7:1,"1I have made you a god to Pharaoh. [אלקים means here] a judge and castigator, to castigate him with plagues and sufferings. Will be your spokesman. [נְבִיאֶךָ is] as Onkelos translates it: “your interpreter.” Similarly, wherever [you find] the term נְבוּאָה (prophecy) [it refers to] a person who proclaims and lets the nation hear words of admonition, and comes from the same root as נִיב שְׂפָתָיִם [or] יָנוּב חָכְמָה — “It utters wisdom,” [or] וַיְכַל מֵהִתְנַבּוֹת — “He ended proclaiming,” of the Book of Shmuel. In Old French he is called preideor — preacher. "
Exodus 8:2,"2And the frog emerged. There was [only] one frog and [when] they struck at it it would split apart into various teeming swarms. That is its midrashic explanation. But as to its plain meaning, it may be said [that] the swarming of the frogs is referred to in the singular. Similarly וַתְּהִי הַכִּנָּם — [lit.] “There was lice” [referring to] the swarming. Pedoliere, in Old French — swarming lice, so, too וַתַּעַל הַצְּפַרְדֵּעַ [is translated as] grenoilliere in Old French — a swarm of frogs. "
Exodus 9:2,"2Holding them. [מַחֲזִיק בָּם means] holding them, as in “(וְהֶחֱזִיקָה) and she took hold of his private parts.” "
Exodus 10:1,"1Adonoy said to Moshe “Go in to Pharaoh — and warn him.” I will be able to set. שִׁתִי is the same as שׂוּמִי (another version: שִׂימִי), [meaning:] “that I will set.”"
Exodus 11:1,"1Completely. [Onkelos translates כָּלָה as:] גְמִירָא — completely [having the same meaning as] כָּלִיל [Here, meaning] “He will send you all away.” "
Exodus 12:1,"1Adonoy said to Moshe and Aharon. Since Aharon performed, and troubled himself, in regard to the wonders, just as much as Moshe, He (God) does him this honor at the first mitzvah, by including him with Moshe in this message. In the land of Egypt — [but] outside the city. or was that not so, but [it was] rather within the city? The Torah, therefore, states [concerning Moshe’s prayer]: “When I leave the city, etc.” Now, if [regarding] prayer, which is [relatively] less significant, he would not pray within the city for it was full of idols, then, [regarding] a message [from God], which is so much more significant, how much more so [that he would leave the city.] "
Exodus 13:2,"2That open the womb. [Meaning:] that is the first to open the womb as in: “(פֹּטֵר מַיִם) As one who makes an opening for water, [so is] the beginning of an argument.” Similarly “יַפְטִירוּ בְשָׂפָה” — they will open their lips It is mine. “I have acquired them for Myself by My having struck down the Egyptian first-born” "
Exodus 14:2,"2And have them turn back. They kept moving nearer to Egypt the entire third day in order to mislead Pharaoh so that he might say: “They are lost in the wilderness,” as it is said: “Pharaoh said of the B’nei Yisrael, etc.” And camp before Pi Hachiros [Pi Hachiros] is Pisom, but was now called Pi Hachiros, because there they became free men (בְּנֵי חוֹרִין) They (חִירוֹת) were two high, upright rocks and the valley between them was called פִּי (the mouth of) הַסְּלָעִים (of the rocks). Facing Ba’al Tzephon. It alone was left from all the gods of Egypt, in order to mislead them  — so that they might say that their god was [too] difficult [to defeat]. It is concerning this that Iyov expressly said, “He causes the nations to err so that he might destroy them.” "
Exodus 15:1,"1Then Moshe sang. [I.e.,] Then, when Moshe saw the miracle, it entered his mind (שֶׁיָּשִׁיר) to sing a song. Similarly: “Then יְדַבֵּר Yehoshua.” Similarly: “And a house יַעֲשֶׂה for Pharaoh’s daughter,” [meaning:] he thought in his heart to make it for her. Here, too, יָשִׁיר [means] his heart told him that he should sing, and he did so [as is immediately added:] “וַיֹּאמְרוּ לֵאמֹר and they said, ‘I will sing to Adonoy’ ” Similarly in the case of Yehoshua — when he saw the miracle, his heart told him to speak, and he did so [as it says:] “And he said before the eyes of Israel.” This also applies to the Song of the Well, which begins with: אָז יָשִׁיר יִשְׂרָאֵל it explicitly states afterwards: “Come up, you Well — sing to it” [similarly:] אָז יִבְנֶה שְׁלֹמֹה בָּמָה, which the Sages of Israel explained that he wanted to build [an altar for an idol] but he did not [actually] build one. We learn from this that the prefix letter י' is used to express intention. All of the above is to satisfy [the verse’s] plain meaning. However, its midrashic explanation: Our Sages, of blessed memory, said: From here we derive an allusion that the resurrection of the dead [has its source] in Scripture. This applies to all [the examples cited] except for the one regarding Shlomo which they explained “he intended to build but did not build.” One cannot say and explain this usage the same way as other things written in the future tense and, yet, referring to the present; for example: “Thus (יַעֲשֶׂה) is Iyov doing” [or:] “At the command of God (יַחֲנוּ) they encamp” [or:] “Sometimes the cloud is [on the Mishkon].” This is because they are things that were continuously happening and they can accept both future and past. But this (יָשִׁיר and the other examples) which was only a one-time occurrence cannot be explained in these terms. For He is most high. גָּאֹה גָּאָה is as Onkelos translates it. (An alternate explanation: The repetition [of גָאֹה גָּאָה] intends to convey that He did something that is impossible for a human to do. When he (the human) fights against his fellow man and overpowers him, he will throw him from his horse, whereas, here: “The horse and its rider he threw into the sea.” And regarding anything that cannot be done by anyone else [except Him], the correct expression is גֵאוּת (גָאָה) as in: “For (גֵאוּת) gloriously has He done.” Similarly, everywhere in the Shira you will find repetitive expressions, [e.g.,] “the strength and retribution of God was the cause of my deliverance.” [or:] “Adonoy is the master of war Adonoy is His name.” And so on [in the rest of the verses].  — From an old Rashi manuscript) Another explanation: For He is most high, He transcends all songs. and as much as I may praise him, there is still more in Him [to be praised] and not like a king of flesh and blood who is praised and does not possess [those attributes]. Horse and its rider — both tied to each other and the water brought them up high and then threw them to the depths and, yet, they did not come apart.He threw. [רָמָה means] He threw. Similarly: “(וּרְמִיו) They were thrown into a burning furnace.” There is a Midrash Aggada: One verse states רָמָה — thrown upwards, whereas another verse states יָרָה — thrown downwards. This teaches that they went up to the heights and went down to the abyss; as in: “who (יָרָה) threw down the cornerstone?”  — from above to below. "
Exodus 16:1,"1The fifteenth day. The date of this encampment is specifically mentioned because on that day they finished the[ir supply of] cake which they took out of Egypt. and [now] they needed the manna. We learn from this that from the remains of the dough they ate sixty one meals [through the 15th of Iyar] and the manna descended for them on the sixteenth day of Iyar, which was on the first day of the week as is cited in Maseches Shabbos. "
Exodus 17:2,2 Why are you testing — by saying: “Is He capable of giving water in an arid land?” 
Exodus 18:1,"1Yisro heard. What news had he heard [which inspired him] to come? [It was] the splitting of the Reed Sea and the war against Amaleik. Yisro. He was called by seven names: Re’uel, Yeser, Yisro, Chovov, Chever, Keini, Putiel. [He was called] יֶתֶר, (שֶׁיִתֵּר) because he was the cause of an additional parsha in the Torah: [viz.,] וְאַתָּה תֶחֶזֶה — “You must seek out.” [He was called] יִתְרוֹ for when he became a proselyte and fulfilled the mitzvos a letter was added to his name. [He was called] חוֹבֵב (שֶׁחִבֵּב) because he showed love for the Torah. [The proof that] Chovov is Yisro is: for it is said: “...of the sons of Chovov, Moshe’s father-in-law.” Others say that Re’uel was [actually] Yisro’s father. Then why does it say: “They (Yisro’s daughters) came to their father, Re’uel?” This is because children call their grandfather, “father.” This is from Sifrei (Beha’aloscho 10, 29). Moshe’s father-in-law. Here Yisro prides himself with Moshe, [as if to say:] “I am the king’s father-in-law,” whereas, in the past, Moshe would attribute the greatness [he attained] to his father-in-law, as it is said: “He returned to Yeser, his father-in-law.”For Moshe and [for his people] Yisrael. Moshe is equal to all of Yisrael. About all that [Elokim] had done — for them, with the coming down of the manna, with “the well,” and with [the war of] Amaleik. That Adonoy brought out, etc. This being the greatest [miracle] of them all. "
Exodus 19:1,1On that very day. On the first day of the month. It need only to have written בַּיּוֹם הַהוּא; why is בַּיּוֹם הַזֶּה written? [This teaches] that the words of the Torah should be as new to you (as though they were given today). 
Exodus 20:1,"1Elohim spoke. אֱלֹקִים refers only to [God as] Judge. Since there are chapters in the Torah that if a person fulfills them he receives a reward, but if he does not fulfill them he does not receive punishment, I might think that the Ten Commandments are also of this type. Therefore the Torah writes: “Elohim spoke” — that He is a Judge who exacts punishment. All these words. This teaches that God said the Ten Commandments in one utterance, something that is impossible for man to utter. If this was so then why does the Torah repeat: “I am Adonoy” and “You must not have”? Because He explicitly repeated each and every command separately. Saying. This teaches us that they replied “Yes” to a positive command and “no” to a negative command. "
Exodus 21:1,"1These are the laws. Wherever the word אֵלֶּה (without a vov) is used it disqualifies that which preceded it [But the word] וְאֵלֶּה (with a vov) is a continuation of that which preceded it. [Here too וְאֵלֶּה conveys that] just as the preceding words (the Ten Commandments) were [received] from Sinai these [following laws] also were [received] from Sinai. Then why was the section of judgments placed near the section dealing with the altar? This is to teach you that the chamber of the Sanhedrin should be placed near the Beis Hamikdosh (some mss: the altar).That you shall set before them. God said to Moshe: “Do not allow it to enter your mind to say, ‘I will teach them the section or the law two or three times until it will become fluent in their mouths exactly as it is taught, but I will not bother myself to make them understand the reasons for each thing and its explanation.’ ” It therefore states: “that you shall set before them” — like a set table with everything ready to be eaten, for the person. Before them — and not before the gentiles. And even if you know of a particular law that they render the same as Jewish law, [nevertheless] do not bring the matter to their courts for one who brings law cases of Bnei Yisrael before [the courts of] gentiles profanes the Name of God and esteems the name of the idols bringing [undue] praise to them (other mss: to bring [undue] importance to them) as it is said: “For their rock is not as our Rock that our enemies should be our judges,” [thereby indicating] that when our enemies are our judges, it is testimony to the superiority of their idols. "
Exodus 22:1,"1If while breaking in. If he was actually in the act of breaking in. There is no liability for his blood. This is not considered murder. It is as if he (the thief) had already been dead. Here the Torah teaches: if someone comes to kill you, kill him first. This [thief] came with the intention of killing you for he knows full well that man cannot control himself while seeing his property being taken from him, and remain silent. Therefore it is with this intention that he came — that if the owner of the property will resist him he will kill him. "
Exodus 23:1,"1Do not accept a false report. As Onkelos translates it: “Do not accept a false report.” This is an admonition directed to one who accepts (i.e., believes) slanderous talk, and to a judge, that he not listen to the claims of one party until the other party arrives. Do not join hands with a wicked man. One who makes a demand on his fellow man by means of a false claim, and you promise him that you will be a corrupt witness. "
Exodus 24:1,"1He (God) had said to Moshe, “Go up.. .” This section was said before [the giving] of the Ten Commandments and it was on the 4th of Sivan that, “Go up!” was said to him."
Exodus 25:2,"2Have them take for Me a terumah-offering. לִי [means] for the sake of My Name. A terumah-offering. [תְּרוּמָה means:] setting aside, [i.e.,] let them set aside from their possessions a donation. Whose heart impels him to generosity. יִדְּבֶנּוּ has the same root as נְדָבָה — “a donation.” It is a term meaning “good-will,” presant in Old French (wholehearted gift). Shall you take My terumah-offering. Our Sages said: The expression תְּרוּמָה is mentioned here three times, [thereby alluding to three different terumah-offerings]. One is the terumah-offering of a bekka (half-shekel) per head from which the “sockets” were made, as is explained in the parsha אֵלֶּה פְקוּדֵי. Another is the terumah-offering for the altar, [which also consisted of] a bekka per head for the coffers [from which] the communal sacrifices were brought. And another is the terumah-offering for the mishkon — the donation of each individual. The thirteen items mentioned in this section were all needed for the works of the mishkon or for the kohanim vestments, [as will become apparent] if you will scrutinize them."
Exodus 26:1,"1You shall make the mishkon out of ten drapes — to serve as a roof and partitions on the outside of the planks, for the drapes were hung behind them to cover them. Fine twined linen, greenish-blue, dark red and crimson. Thus you have four kinds [of material] together in each and every thread, one of linen and three of wool. Each and every thread was made six-fold. Hence the four materials when woven together made each strand consist of 24 threadsA (see illustration on page 142). Figures of cherubim, the work of a craftsman. Cherubim were formed in them (the drapes) through weaving, and not through embroidery which is done through needlework. But, rather, by weaving on two sides, one image on one side and another image on the other side, a lion on this side and an eagle on the other side, just as silken belts are woven [nowadays], which are called feises (woven images) in Old French. "
Exodus 27:1,"1You shall make the altar, etc. And its height shall be three amohs. The words mean what they say. This is the opinion of Rabbi Yehudah. Rabbi Yosi, however, says: it states here: “[it shall be] square” and it states concerning the inner [altar]: “square.” [This גְּזֵירָה שָׁוָה teaches:] just as in the latter case its height was twice its length, here, too, its height was twice its length. Then, how am I to understand: “and its height shall be three amohs”? [The answer is that the “three amohs are] from the top edge of the soveiv upwards. (See illustration on page 416.) "
Exodus 28:1,"1And take unto you — after the work of the mishkon is completed."
Exodus 29:1,"1Take. [לְקַח means] the same as קַח. They are of two different roots one in the form of קִיחָה (i.e., no ל') and the other in the form of לְקִיחָה (with a  ל'), [but] both having the same meaning. One bull — to atone for the act of [worshipping the golden] calf [a calf] being [of the same species as] a bull"
Exodus 30:1,1To burn incense. [I.e.] to raise up on it burning smoke of incense. 
Exodus 31:2,2I have called by name — to do My work — Betzalel. 
Exodus 32:1,"1That Moshe was late. As Onkelos translates it — a term for lateness. Similarly: “[Why] is the rider (בּשֵׁשׁ) late?” [or:] “They waited until (בּוֹשׁ) it was late.” For when Moshe ascended the mountain he had told them: “At the end of forty days I will return within [the first] six hours.” They thought that the day that he ascended is included [in the forty days] but, actually, he had told them “full [days]” [i.e.] forty days, each day with its preceding night. But the day that he ascended, its night was not part of it for he ascended on the seventh of Sivan. Consequently the actual 40th day was the seventeenth of Tammuz. On the sixteenth (of Tammuz) the Satan came and caused disorder in the world by creating the appearance of darkness, deep gloom and confusion [so as to lead people] to say: “Moshe has certainly died and therefore the world has been thrown into disorder.” He said to them: “Moshe has died, for six hours have already come and he still has not come, etc.” as is related in Tractate Shabbos. It is impossible to say that their mistake was due only to a cloudy day whether it was before or after noon, for Moshe did not descend until the following day, as it is said: “They arose early the next morning and offered burnt-offerings.” That will lead us. They yearned to have many gods.For this Moshe, the man. The Satan showed them a likeness of Moshe being carried in the air high in the sky. Who brought us up from the land of Egypt — and taught us the way to go; now we need gods who will go before us. "
Exodus 33:1,"1Leave, go up from this. Eretz Yisrael is the highest of all the lands. Therefore it says: “Go up.” An alternate explanation [for the expression: “Go up”]: as opposed to what He said to him in time of anger: “Go down,” He said to him in time of good-will “Go up.” You and the people. Here he did not say: “and your people.”"
Exodus 34:1,"1Carve out for yourself. He (God) showed him a quarry of precious stone from within his tent and said to him: The [פְּסוֹלֶת — from פְּסָל] chips shall be [שֶׁלְךָ — from לְךָ] yours. From there Moshe became extremely wealthy. Carve out for yourself. You broke the First [Tablets], you carve out others for yourself. A parable: [this is comparable] to a king who went off to a faraway land and left his betrothed with the maidservants. As a result of the immoral behavior of the maidservants her (the betrothed’s) reputation was besmirched. Her bridesman arose and tore up her marriage contract, saying: “If the king will decide to kill her I will tell him: ‘She is not yet your wife’.” [Consequently] the king investigated and found that the immoral behavior was only on the part of the maidservants. He was reconciled with her, whereupon the bridesman said to him (the king): “Write her another marriage contract for the first one was torn up.” The king replied to him: “You are the one who tore it up. You buy other paper for yourself and I will write it for her in my handwriting.” Here, too, the king is God, the maidservants are the riffraff, the bridesman is Moshe, God’s betrothed is Yisrael. Therefore it says: “Carve out for yourself.” "
Exodus 35:1,"1And Moshe assembled — on the day following Yom Kippur when he came down from the mountain. It (וַיַּקְהֵל) is in the causative form, for one does not assemble people, literally, with one’s hands but, rather, they are “caused to be assembled” by means of his saying so. The correct version of this in Onkelos is: וְאַכְנִישׁ — “He caused that they assemble.”"
Exodus 36:5,"5More than is needed for the tasks. [Meaning:] more than what was needed for the work."
Exodus 37:1,"1And Betzalel made. Because he extended himself for the work more than the other wise men, it (the work) bears his name. "
Exodus 38:1,"1From the greenish-blue wool, dark red wool, etc. Linen is not mentioned here. And it is from here that I derive that these בִּגְדֵי שְׂרָד are not the priestly garments for the priestly garments did contain linen. But, rather, they are “garments” with which the vessels of the Sanctuary were covered when it was disassembled for travelling, which contained no linen."
Exodus 39:3,"3And spread over the ark. [וְסַכֹּתָ] a term meaning “shielding,” for [in this case] it was a partition. "
