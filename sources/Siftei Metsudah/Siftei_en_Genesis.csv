Genesis 2:2,"[2] R. Shimon said, flesh and blood who cannot know... Rashi is answering the question: ויכל אלהים ביום השביעי implies that Hashem worked even on the seventh day, but concluded the work then. Yet it is written, “He abstained on the seventh day,” implying that He did no work at all. [Thus Rashi explains, “It appears as if He concluded His work on that very day.”] "
Genesis 3:1,"[1] Why is this incident inserted here? Re’m asks: How does Rashi know that the coats were made right at Adam and Chavah’s creation, to protect from cold and heat, giving rise to the question: “Why is this incident inserted here?” Perhaps the coats were made only after they sinned by eating from the tree, to cover their shame of being naked! This way, the verses are in proper sequence [and Rashi’s question does not arise]. It seems that Rashi knew it because it is written (v. 20), “The man called his wife’s name Chavah,” and subsequently, (v. 21) “And Hashem Elokim made for Adam and his wife leather coats.” Rashi explains that this verse “And man gave names...,” returns to the earlier narrative. As the naming of Chavah was before the sin, and is connected to “And Hashem made... leather coats,” we can conclude that right at their creation Hashem made them coats [to protect from cold and heat]. Thus, the coats were not made to cover their shame after they sinned. An alternative answer is: [Rashi knew it] because it is written, “Hashem made... leather coats and He clothed them.” Why, because they sinned, would Hashem have to clothe them Himself?! They should clothe themselves, just as they made for themselves loincloths. It should have written, “Hashem made... leather coats for clothing.” Perforce, Hashem made them coats right at their creation to protect from cold and heat. Re’m asks: [If they had coats from the beginning,] why were they “naked” (v. 25)? The answer is: According to the opinion (Bereishis Rabba 20:12) that כתנות עור means fingernail-like garments, smooth [and transparent], which cleaved to their skin, they were as naked. Although it was attached to their skin, their entire body was revealed, including the loins. And even according to the opinion (ibid) that the garments were of rabbit fur, to protect from cold and heat, still they were naked — for Adam was created in Tishrei (according to Rabbi Eliezer), or in Nisan (according to Rabbi Yehoshua), when it is neither cold nor hot; [thus they were not dressed.] They were not embarrassed to be naked since they did not yet eat from the tree. The serpent “saw them unclothed, indulging in marital relations unashamedly, and he coveted her.” We need not ask: If so, why did they take fig leaves to make loincloths? They should have worn the coats! [The answer is:] Indeed they could have. But just then the coats were not available to them and they did not want to stand naked for even a moment. In any case, this point [of when the garments were created] seems to be disputed. For it says in Pesachim 54a: “Ten things were created at twilight on Erev Shabbos... and some say: ‘Also Adam’s garments.’” The second view holds that the garments were created after they sinned, for they sinned in the tenth hour of the day, which is before twilight. But the first view could hold that the garments were created before the sin. (Nachalas Yaakov) "
Genesis 4:1,[1] This... before he sinned. Rashi is answering the question: It should have been written וַיֵדַע [rather than יָדַע]. 
Genesis 5:1,"[1] That on the same day that he was created he begot. [Rashi knows this] because it is written, “This is the book of the generations of man on the day...” implying that on the day he was created he had offspring. Accordingly, “On the day,” is attached to “generations of man,” rather than to “He made him in the likeness of Hashem” which follows. For otherwise, why does it say, “On the day Elohim created?” The Torah should have simply written, “The generations of man, in the image of Hashem He made them,” and that would suffice. Perforce, “This is the book of the generations of man” refers back to (4:1), “The man knew his wife, Chavah” and she gave birth to Kayin and Hevel. "
Genesis 6:2,[2] When they improved (מטיבין
Genesis 7:1,"[1] [We learn] from this that we tell... This raises a question: Now that the Torah taught us the proper conduct of telling only מקצת, i.e., part of a man’s good qualities, the man will understand on his own that his good qualities are double this, [thus defeating the purpose]! It seems the answer is: Telling מקצת does not necessarily mean half. It could be a small amount: a tenth or a hundredth. Thus, the man will not know the extent of his good qualities. (Nachalas Yaakov) "
Genesis 8:1,"[1] The merit that they did not corrupt... This implies that the other animals corrupted their ways on their own, not due to demons. Otherwise, what was the merit of these animals? The same is implied by, “They did not cohabit in the ark,” meaning, on their own. (Kitzur Mizrachi) Both merits were needed, since “not corrupting their ways” was not an active mitzvah; it was merely refraining from sin. (Although it says in Makkos 23b that he who passively refrains from a sin is rewarded as if he did a mitzvah, but it says in Kiddushin 39b that this applies only when a chance to sin presented itself but he held back.) Therefore the animals needed also the merit of not cohabiting in the ark, which was self-imposed abstinence from permitted behavior. But this merit alone was insufficient, as it somewhat resembled doing a mitzvah without being commanded, [which is a lesser merit]. For we have no source to indicate that the animals were forbidden to cohabit in the ark. Hashem forbade only Noach and his sons. Although Rashi later says that, “Let them spread over the earth” (v. 17), teaches that the animals had a prohibition to propagate in the ark, they accepted this upon themselves without Hashem’s command. Why does the verse not say that Hashem remembered also the birds and Noach’s sons? It seems the answer is: Cham, and the raven, sinned by cohabiting in the ark. That is why Noach’s sons and the birds are not mentioned. [If so, why are beasts and animals mentioned, when the dog cohabited in the ark (Bereishis Rabba 36:7)? The answer is:] There is an uncertainty about dogs. Perhaps they are in the category of “beasts”; perhaps in that of “animals.” Although Heaven surely knows, still, the Sages disagreed about it. Thus we see that Hashem’s will is not to resolve it, and therefore, Scripture does not omit either beasts or animals [although dogs are included in one of these two categories]. (Nachalas Yaakov) A spirit of comforting. Rashi is answering the question: If it was an actual wind, why is written afterwards, “And the water subsided”? On the contrary, it is written (Tehillim 147:8), “He blows His wind; water runs.” [I.e., wind does not calm the waters.] (Devek Tov) Alternatively, Rashi knows this because it says, “Over the earth.” How could a wind blow over the earth’s surface when the water covered the earth? But if it was “a spirit of comforting,” it is understandable. “Over the earth” then means, “On account of the matters of the earth.” In other words, for the sake of man who dwells on the earth. "
Genesis 9:3,"[3] “I did not permit... The reason why Noach was permitted to eat meat, while Adam was not, seems to be as follows: Previously, men and animals were equal in that they all were Hashem’s creations. He formed them all from the earth; none had higher status than the other [as regards their bodies]. Why should one kill the other? But when they sinned, all should have been destroyed, and they survived only in Noach’s merit. This gave Noach a higher status than the animals. (Kitzur Mizrachi) Scripture connected the permission to eat meat to that of eating vegetables so we will not say that meat is now permitted instead of vegetables, and vegetables are no longer permitted. Thus Scripture tells us that eating meat is in addition to eating vegetables. (Divrei Dovid) "
Genesis 10:2,"[2] This refers to Persia. You might ask: Why does Rashi explain Tiras any more than the others? The answer is: Rashi said on 9:27 (ד""ה וישכון) that “Cyrus, Yefes’ descendant, built the Second Temple.” And one might ask: How does Rashi know that Cyrus came from Yefes? Thus Rashi explains here that Tiras is Persia, so Persia is from Yefes. And Cyrus, king of Persia, assumedly descended from Tiras. Furthermore, the Re’m says that Rashi [explains Tiras because he] is answering the question: Why here is it written מדי, not פרס? These two nations are always mentioned together! Thus Rashi explains that Tiras is פרס. But Tzeidah L’Derech says that [it is not as the Re’m said. Rather, Rashi explains Tiras because] it is from Yoma 10a: “How do we know that the Persians come from Yefes? Because it is written, ‘The sons of Yefes were: Gomer... and Tiras.’ And Rav Yosef taught: Tiras is Persia.” [Thus, Rashi brings it to prove that Cyrus came from Yefes.]"
Genesis 11:1,"[1] The holy language. For if it was another language, there would not be only one language [on earth, as the holy language remained until this point.]. For all agree that the world was created with the holy language, as Rashi explained on (2:23): “The man said, ‘This at last... shall be called אשה.’” Another explanation: Against the Sole Being of the universe. There is a question on the first explanation: Why does it not say בדברים אחדים (with conforming words)? Thus Rashi says, “Another explanation...” But this answer also raises a difficulty: Why does it not say ודברים אחרים (and other words)? Thus Rashi offers the third explanation, which interprets דברים אחדים to mean דברים חדים (sharp words). (Maharshal) "
Genesis 12:1,"[1]It is there that I will make you into a great nation. Rashi is explaining his comment of above: “For your own benefit, for your own good.” What is the good? “I will make you into a great nation.” And what is the benefit? “I will make your character known to the world.” Since the next verse elaborates by saying, “I will make you into a great nation ... and make your name great,” we learn that it was for this purpose that Hashem told Avraham to go there. The [repetitive phrase] לך לך does not present a difficulty, for [similarly] it is written in Shir HaShirim 2:11: הגשם חלף הלך לו. Thus we could explain the phrase לך לך is common in Scripture. Nevertheless we explain [such a phrase] where possible, [as Rashi does here]. So wrote Re’m, but it seems to me that it indeed presents a difficulty everywhere it appears. With הגשם חלף הלך לו, it means that the rain ceased, following its nature and inclination. But here, Hashem told Avraham to “Go from your land” against his will, [so that explanation does not fit]. Thus Rashi explains, “For your benefit...” The Maharshal writes: There is a difficulty with Rashi’s first explanation, [“It is there that I will make you into a great nation.” For in v. 2,] we need to insert the phrase, “It is there that.” Thus Rashi offers the second explanation, “I will make your character known to the world.” But according to this explanation, a question arises: What is meant by (v. 2), “I will make you into a great nation”? Therefore, Rashi needs both explanations."
Genesis 13:1,"[1]To arrive at the south of Eretz Yisrael. Rashi is answering the question: Avraham was [already] in the south, for Egypt is south of Eretz Yisrael and in the south of the world. Accordingly, why is it not written, “Avraham went up north”? Thus Rashi explains, “To arrive at the south of Eretz Yisrael.” "
Genesis 14:1,"[1]Who told Avraham, “Jump...” Rashi is answering the question: Was not Nimrod [not Amraphel] the king of Shinar?"
Genesis 15:5,"[5]But Avraham will have a son. Although he had Yishmael while he was still called Avram, it says in Kiddushin 68b: “Your son from a nonJewess is not called your son.” Therefore, Yishmael could not be his heir. This explains the use of the term הבטה: from above to below. You might ask: If so, why does it say (Bamidbar 21:9), “He would look (והביט) upon the copper snake and live,” [although he was lower than the snake]? The answer is: It means the copper snake would “look” upon him. And why is it written (Tehillim 34:6), “They looked (הביטו) to Him and became radiant,” which is from below to above? The answer is: Hashem is found everywhere. (source unknown) But Re’m explains: Rashi is saying that the הבטה mentioned here is from above to below, [but not everywhere else]."
Genesis 16:1,"[1]She was Pharaoh’s daughter ...  Rashi knows this because it is written לה שפחה, even though everything a woman acquires belongs to her husband, [so Hagar really belonged to Avraham]. It must be that Hagar was Pharaoh’s daughter and he gave her to Sarah. Therefore it is written ולה שפחה to hint to the miracles performed “לה” — for Sarah — which Pharaoh saw. "
Genesis 17:1,"[1]I am the One Whose Godliness suffices. Avraham had said to Hashem: “If I circumcise myself, people will regard me with disgust!” Hashem answered him: “I am the One Who said to My world: It suffices...” (Maharshal) This, too, is an imperative following an imperative, “Be perfect...” [Rashi is answering the question:] Since it is already written, “Walk before Me,” what was added by, “And be perfect”? Rashi explains that this, too, is a command. It is one imperative following another, saying: “Be perfect in all My tests.” Now you are lacking five organs ...  The Re’m writes: These organs, over which a person lacks full control, lead him to sin. But because of Avraham’s great righteousness, Hashem gave him control over them. For it is written (Shmuel I, 2:9), “The feet of His pious ones He will guard”: when one overcomes one’s yetzer hara, in the end Hashem gives one full control over it [see Yoma 38b]. Two eyes ... You might ask: Could Avraham really have lacked all these organs? The answer is: Surely he had them, but since he did not control them, it was as if he lacked them. Hashem now told him that they would all be under his control. Question: Did Avraham not lack the heart as well, as he was still uncircumcised of heart? The answer is: Only external organs are counted here. Furthermore, it is written in Nechemiah 9:8: “You found his [Avraham’s] heart faithful before You. And [then] You made the bris with him.” We see that even before circumcision, Avraham’s heart was hardly [considered as] uncircumcised. (Maharshal)"
Genesis 18:1,"[1]To visit the sick person. You might ask: How did Rashi know this? The answer is: Because it is written, “Hashem appeared to him,” rather than, “Hashem appeared to Avraham.” [And why is this?] Perforce, it does not mention Avraham explicitly because it relates back to the previous passage regarding the bris milah, where it is expressly written, “To Avraham.” If so, why did Hashem appear to him now? Not to command him about milah—as He already commanded him, and he already performed milah on himself and on the members of his household. It must be that [since Avraham was sick due to the milah,] He came to visit the sick. Alternatively, Rashi knew this because the verse does not go on to explain why Hashem appeared to him. Thus we may assume it was to visit the sick. Question: Why does Rashi say, “To visit the sick person,” rather than simply saying, “To visit him”? [The answer is:] Because we learn from here the mitzvah of visiting the sick, as it says in Bava Metzia 86b. Since it was not limited to Avraham, Rashi says: “To visit the sick person.” "
Genesis 19:1,"[1]Elsewhere they are called men. Rashi is answering the question: By calling them angels, the verse implies that they [appeared as angels and] wore angels’ garments. But this cannot be; why then would Lot bake matzos [for them]? Perforce, they appeared to him as men. Thus Rashi explains, “Elsewhere they are called men...” I.e., they are merely called so, not that they [now] divested themselves of physicality. Regarding Avraham they were called men, out of respect for the Divine Presence. But with Lot, the Divine Presence was not there — so they are called angels. "
Genesis 20:1,"[1]When he saw that the cities were destroyed and the travelers ceased... This explanation raises the question: Why did he go to Gerar, which is very distant? Therefore Rashi brings the alternate explanation. Since he wished to distance himself from Lot, he traveled to Gerar which was an inhabited place. (Maharshal)"
Genesis 21:1,"[1]To teach you that whoever prays for mercy for another... You might ask: How does this prove it? Perhaps she was remembered now because this was the time Hashem set. She needed to give birth on Pesach, and she was remembered on Rosh Hashanah, so it had to be now. The answer is: Rashi himself answered this when he wrote, “He had already remembered her before He cured Avimelech.” And what is the verse teaching us by saying that Hashem cured Sarah first? Perforce, “To teach you that whoever prays for mercy for another...” (Re’m) The Re’m objects: Rashi implies that this section is out of place, for he says, “This section was placed here to teach you...” But this is not so, for on the fifteenth of Nisan the angel foretold to Sarah, and on the sixteenth, Sedom was overturned and Lot was rescued with his daughters. And right after the incident of Lot with his daughters, Avraham traveled to reside in Gerar, where Sarah was taken and Hashem restrained every womb of Avimelech’s house, whereupon Avraham prayed for them and they were cured. And on Rosh Hashanah, Sarah was remembered. Everything is in chronological order! He answers: וה' פקד implies He remembered her before He cured Avimelech. [Had Sarah conceived after, it would say ויפקוד ה'.] Thus, Avimelech’s curing should not have been written before. And why was it? In order “to teach you that whoever prays for mercy for another...” "
Genesis 22:2,[2]נא
Genesis 23:1,"[1]The reason שנה is written with every set... I.e., and Scripture does not gather the ones and the tens in a set, and the hundreds in a separate set, as it did in Parshiyos Bereishis and Noach. Rashi’s is not asking why it says שנה for 100 years whereas it says שנים for seven years, for also in Parshiyos Bereishis and Noach it is always written שנה for hundreds, and שנים for smaller numbers. Rather, Rashi’s question is about the middle שנה, written after twenty, for שנה is never written three times. Perforce, it is meant to be expounded upon. Since one of them is to be expounded, so too are the rest to be expounded. "
Genesis 24:1,"[1]Since he had a son he needed to find a wife for him. Otherwise, why does it say this here? The reason Scripture does not write outright [that he had a son] is to teach us that the son was considered like “all things.” Before he had a son, he said (15:2), “What will You give me since I continue to be childless?” But now all his blessings were complete. (Gur Aryeh)"
Genesis 25:1,"[1]Because her deeds were as beautiful as קטורת. But [the first explanation] raises a question: Why was she not named Ketores? Thus Rashi offers the [second] explanation: “Because she ‘tied her womb.’” And the second explanation raises a question: Why was she not named Keshurah, which means “tied” in Hebrew, instead of Keturah, which means “tied” in Aramaic? Therefore, Rashi offers the first explanation. (Maharshal) "
Genesis 26:2,"[2]For you are a burnt-offering without blemish and being outside the [Holy] Land does not befit you. I.e., a burnt-offering is a kodshei kodoshim sacrifice and may not be taken outside the Temple Courtyard. Similarly, the Land of Israel is your “Temple Courtyard”; you may not go outside the Land."
Genesis 27:1,"[1]Because of the smoke of these. This follows its simple meaning: smoke is bad for the eyes. But Rivkah was used to it, as explained in the previous entry. It seems to me that all three reasons are needed, as follows. First Rashi explains that Yitzchok’s blindness was from the smoke, as Scripture juxtaposed it right afterward. But this raises the question: Why did Hashem bring this misfortune on him? [Rashi answers:] Perforce, Hashem did not save him from this cause [of blindness] so that Yaakov could receive the blessing. But a question remains: In any case, if there was smoke, why did not Rivkah, too, become blind? Thus Rashi explains that Yitzchok’s eyes were already weakened from the akeidah, and the smoke caused him to lose his sight altogether. (Maharshal) "
Genesis 28:2,"[2]Any word that requires a ל prefix... It does not mean just any word, as we find this rule applies only to names of places and countries, such as בבלה and חברונה, and sometimes to vessels, such as המזבחה. "
Genesis 29:2,"[2]The shepherds give the flocks to drink... Meaning: They would give them to drink [regularly]. Similarly with ונאספו and וגללו [in the next verse]; the future tense is used in place of the present tense, to convey that they would regularly gather and roll the stone. "
Genesis 30:1,[1]She was envious of her good deeds. [Rashi knows this] because envy is [otherwise] forbidden. 
Genesis 31:3,"[3]And there I will be with you... This was not a stipulation: “If you return, I will be with you. And if not, I will not be with you.” Rather, Hashem was telling him the reason: Because here it is not possible [to rest My Divine Presence upon you]. "
Genesis 32:3,"[3]Two camps—from outside Eretz Yisrael... Question: Rashi explained on, “Ascending and descending” (v. 28:12), that the two [groups of angels] were not together. Rather, one ascended and only then the other descended. [Why were both groups together here?] The answer is: Rashi explains at the beginning of Parshas Vayishlach that Yaakov sent actual angels [to Eisov]. Accordingly, it means as follows: Here too, the angels of outside Eretz Yisrael wanted to ascend before the angels of Eretz Yisrael would descend. But Yaakov forced them to stay because he wanted to send them to Eisov. If so, this implies that [the messengers sent by Yaakov] were actual angels."
Genesis 33:4,"[4]There are those who explained these dots as saying that he did not kiss him wholeheartedly. Meaning: וישקהו has dots on all letters except the ש. Thus it is as if it is written ויקהו, as in הקהה את שיניו (blunt his teeth — Pesach Haggadah). This is because he intended to bite him. "
Genesis 34:7,"[7]For the gentiles constrained themselves from illicit relationships as a result of the Flood. And one who transgresses is sentenced to death. So did they accept upon themselves, as Rashi mentioned in Parshas Chayei Sarah [24:16]. Although this was beyond the requirement of the law [i.e., to be sentenced to death in a case where the woman is unmarried]. And so too, the expression גדרו עצמן implies: they constrained themselves, although Hashem did not command it. Nachalas Yaakov objected to this answer: The prohibition on unmarried women was merely a constraint and decree that the descendants of Noach [placed upon themselves. If so,] why was Shechem liable for death? The Rambam says because of robbery, and the Ramban says because of Shechem’s various evil deeds, [but no one says that he was liable to be executed for engaging in illicit relations]. And Rashi does not mention the above reasons because he is not seeking to explain why Shechem was liable for death, but to explain that “Such a thing should not be done” even with an unmarried woman. This raises the question of Re’m: [“Is not an unmarried woman permitted to the descendants of Noach?”] to which Rashi answers, “For the gentiles constrained themselves....” See there for elaboration. [An alternate approach:] You might ask: Is not an unmarried woman permitted to the descendants of Noach? The answer is: Since Shechem kidnapped her and thereby had relations with her, it is considered like illicit relations. Thus, he was liable to be executed. (Re’m)"
Genesis 35:1,"[1]Because you lingered on your journey you have been punished... [Rashi knows this] because otherwise, why did Hashem need to command him, “Arise, go up [to Beis Eil]”? Yaakov had already vowed to do this! Perforce, Hashem was telling him: Go up quickly and linger no longer. But Yaakov was not punished for lingering in Lavan’s house, because the vow went into effect only when he began to return [home]. For it is written [when he made his vow], “And if I return in peace...” (28:21)."
Genesis 36:2,"[2]In order to mislead his father. Question: Why did Eisov not call Bosmas, [too,] by a good name in order to trick his father? In Parshas Toldos (26:34), it should have mentioned that name, if she had it. The answer is: Eisov indeed called her by another, non-idolatry name. But [in Parshas Toldos], Scripture itself calls her Bosmas, denoting idolatry. This is because Scripture goes on to say (27:1), “Yitzchok’s eyesight faded and he could not see.” Rashi there explains that this was due to the smoke of these wives [who burned incense to idols]. And if Scripture would have called her by a different name there, we would ask: Where do we find [any hint] that they burned incense [to idols]? Thus Scripture calls her by the name of Bosmas (incense), to indicate this. See there. (Maharshal) [You might ask]: Yehudis was the daughter of Be’eri the Chittite (26:34), while Oholivomoh was the daughter of Anoh the Chivite, [as it says here. How then could Rashi say that Yehudis and Oholivomoh are the same? The answer is:] Anoh and Be’eri is the same person with two names. Although Scripture connects him here to the Chivites and there to the Chittites, it is possible that his father was a Chittite, and his mother, a Chivite. You might ask: How does Rashi know that Yehudis is Oholivomoh? Perhaps Yehudis died, and Oholivomoh is another wife? Re’m answers: Because it is written, “Eisov took his wives,” rather than, “Eisov took wives.” This implies they were the same wives who were mentioned before. "
Genesis 37:1,"[1]After it has written for you concerning the settlements of Eisov and his descendants... Re’m explains that Rashi is answering the question: Why does Scripture not write first ואלה תולדות יעקב..., and then וישב יעקב..., which is the same format that it writes about Eisov. First Eisov’s descendants are enumerated (36:1) and then it tells where they had settled. Rashi answers: “After it has written for you concerning the settlements of Eisov and his descendants...” In other words, Scripture’s purpose is not to enumerate Yaakov’s descendants [as it did with Eisov], but only to explain the settlements of Yaakov and his descendants; and how they settled. [Thus, this section connects to the previous one as regards to settling,] as also the section about Eisov explained his settlement and that of his descendants. For it is written (36:8), “Eisov settled in Mount Seir,” explaining his settlement. Then it describes his descendants, “These are the descendants of Eisov...” and the descendants of his wives. Then it explains the settling of his sons (vs. 40-43), “These are the names of the chiefs of Eisov, each with their families, according to their places... These are the chiefs of Edom according to their places of residence.” Thus for Yaakov, too, Scripture tells about his settlements and that of his descendants, as it is written וישב יעקב..., which means, “Yaakov settled...” Then it is written אלה תולדות יעקב..., meaning: these are the settlements of the descendants of Yaakov, too, like [Scripture explained regarding] the descendants of Eisov. For at this point the Torah begins to recount what happened to them until they came there [to settle the Land]. It begins with “Yoseif at the age of 17,” then his being sold to Egypt and their enslavement there, then the Exodus — this and that happened to them until they came to settle the Land. "
Genesis 38:2,"[2]A merchant. You might ask: How does Rashi know that this term refers to a merchant? Perhaps Shua was an actual Canaanite. The answer is: Avraham did not want to give Yitzchok a Canaanite wife, and also Yitzchok commanded Yaakov not to marry one, so Yaakov’s sons surely would not [marry a Canaanite] either. But you might object: Rashi explained on 37:35, “R. Nechemiah says: ‘They [Yaakov’s daughters-in-law] were Canaanites,’” implying the sons did marry Canaanites. The answer is: Men from a different nation took Canaanite women and begat daughters, [whom Yaakov’s sons married], for these daughters were not [true] Canaanites because the lineage follows the father. But here it cannot be explained so, since it is written, “The daughter of a Canaanite man,” implying that the father was Canaanite."
Genesis 39:1,"[1][Scripture now] returns to the earlier narrative, but only interrupted it... [Rashi knows this] because otherwise [there is a question:] Is it not already written, “The Midianites sold him [in Egypt to Potiphar]” (37:36)? Perforce, Scripture “only interrupted it to relate...” (Gur Aryeh) "
Genesis 40:1,"[1]One, a fly was found in his cup... פיילי means cup in Aramaic. Then Rashi explains that in Greek, cup is פוטירין. "
Genesis 41:1,"[1]Every form of the word קץ means “the end.” It is obvious that קץ means “end,” as Onkelos translates it. However, [Rashi is answering the] question: Why does Scripture write the word ימים? It would be understandable if קץ did not [always] mean “end,” but [also can mean] “some of,” as in מקצה אחיו, “From some of his brothers” (47:2). Accordingly, here it mentions ימים to indicate that it was two full years, not part of two years. But if מקץ always means “end,” why does Scripture write ימים? Rashi answers: We might think מקץ means “some of,” and it always means this, unless it is evident otherwise from the verse. That is why it is written here ימים — to show that it means “end,” and not “some of.” Consequently, קץ always means “end.” For it is evident here that קץ means “end,” and we make a gezeirah shavah between קץ [written here, and any other instance of] קץ. Thus Rashi says, “And [henceforth,] every form of the word קץ means ‘the end’.” So it seems to me, as opposed to Re’m’s explanation, that Rashi says every form of the word קץ means “the end” because Rashi wishes to distinguish קץ from קצה. This is because קצה sometimes means “end,” as in: “At the end (מקצה) of three years” (Devarim 14:28). And it sometimes means “side,” as in: “One cherub on this side (מקצה)” (Shemos 25:19). And it sometimes means “some of,” as in: “From some of (מקצה) his brothers” (47:2). Although [the word קץ] appeared several times previously in Scripture, [and Rashi did not comment there,] this is not problematic, as many similar cases exist [where Rashi does not explain a word the first time it appears]. Re’m writes: We need not object that it says, “At the קץ of seven years, you are to make shemitah” (Devarim 15:1), which apparently means at the beginning of shemitah, as it is written, “But in the seventh year you must let it rest” (Shemos 23:11). For [the answer is:] The verse in Devarim is speaking of releasing debts (השמטת כספים), and this is at the end of shemitah. "
Genesis 42:1,"[1]Why do you show yourselves... as though you are satiated?” Meaning: If you show yourselves to them as being satiated and having grain, they will come and ask us for food, since they are our relatives. Therefore, go and buy food so they will think we have no food. But in fact they did have food at the time. Accordingly, תתראו means satiation."
Genesis 43:3,"[3]“You will not see me without your brother with you.” Rashi is answering the question: In all of Scripture, בלתי means “rather.” So why is it not written בלתי כאשר אחיכם אתכם (rather, you will see me when your brother is with you)? Therefore Rashi says that here, בלתי means “without.” (Re’m) [Rashi is saying] that we should not think it means, “You will not see me; rather, your brother alone will see me.” Thus he explains that it means: “You will not see me without your brother with you.” (Maharshal) "
Genesis 44:2,"[2]גביע is a tall goblet... Since it is written גביע twice, Rashi deduced that it means a tall cup. We need not ask: Why was Yoseif not concerned they would [later] claim the goblet was theirs? Because [the answer is:] It was for divination, so surely it was [not theirs but] Yoseif’s. For it says, “There is no divination amongst Yaakov” (Bamidbar 23:23). (author’s commentary) "
Genesis 45:1,"[1]He could not bear that the Egyptians standing by him... The verse means that Yoseif could not bear his brothers’ humiliation in front of all the people, so he said the people must leave. [Rashi knows this] because otherwise, why did he have them leave? "
Genesis 46:1,"[1]A person must honor his father more than ... his grandfather... Rashi is answering the question: Why did it not say, “To the God of his fathers”? Or, “To the God of Avraham,” who was the main one to spread knowledge of Hashem’s Presence? Whereas Yitzchok received [this knowledge] from Avraham."
Genesis 47:2,"[2]But there is a reason for this... Which is: the entire forty years the Israelites were in the wilderness, Yehudah’s bones rattled in his coffin, [and Moshe prayed for him]. Rashi cites this on Devarim 33:7."
Genesis 48:2,"[2]There are numerous such elliptical verses. Rashi does not explain here that the teller was Ephraim, as he explained above, since “he took his two sons with him” implies that Ephraim was with Yoseif and went with him to Yaakov. "
Genesis 49:3,"[3]He had never had a nocturnal emission. [Rashi knows this] because אוני is redundant, for it is already written כחי, and אוני and כחי have the same meaning as Rashi explains. [Question:] A woman cannot conceive from her first act of relations. [So how could Reuvein the son of Leah, have been conceived from Yaakov’s first drop? The answer is:] Perhaps Leah had been deflowered by a piece of wood. Re’m answers: She had deflowered herself with her finger. There are other answers; see there. Nachalas Yaakov writes: If not for what they wrote, I would explain that Leah did not actually conceive from the first drop. Rather, all of Yaakov’s drops were for [the purpose of conceiving] Reuvein, as Yaakov never had a nocturnal emission due to improper thoughts. See what he says there. "
Genesis 50:3,"[3]They completed the days of his embalming until forty days. Rashi is answering the question: [Why does it say וימלאו?] The term מלוי (completion) applies only to a predetermined number, such as: “I will fill (אמלא) the number of your days” (Shemos 23:26), meaning the number of days apportioned to you. Similarly (25:24): “When her days of pregnancy were completed (וימלאו),” meaning the number of days apportioned for her pregnancy. There are many [other examples of this] in Scripture. But here, there was no predetermined number, so Rashi needed to add: “They completed the days of his embalming.” Their period for embalming was for a predetermined number of forty days, as Rashi goes on to say. Rashi says השלימו instead of וימלאו, to teach that this מילוי denotes “completion,” rather than denoting “full” which is the opposite of empty. (Re’m) "
