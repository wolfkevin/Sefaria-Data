Deuteronomy 2:1,"1We turned and travelled into the wilderness. °Had they not sinned, they would have travelled by way of Mount Seir to enter the Land from its southern [border] to its northern [border]; but because they sinned they were forced to turn to the wilderness which is between the Reed Sea and the southern edge of Mount Seir. They then travelled along its southern edge moving from west to east. By way of the Reed Sea [route]. °The route they travelled when leaving Egypt, which is the southwestern tip. From there they travelled eastward. And we circled Mount Seir. °We traversed its entire southern rim, until we came to the land of Moav. "
Deuteronomy 3:1,1We turned and went up. The entire [journey] northward was uphill. 
Deuteronomy 4:2,"2Do not add. For instance to place five parshiyos in the tefillin, to take five species [of fruit] for the mitzvah of lulav, to place five fringes [instead of four on one’s garment]; and this also applies to (the command), “And do not subtract from them.”"
Deuteronomy 5:3,"3Not with our fathers °alone did Adonoy make this covenant, etc., but with us, etc.. "
Deuteronomy 6:4,"4Adonoy is our God, Adonoy is one. °Adonoy who is presently our God and not the God of the nations, will in the future be [recognized] as the One God, as is said, “For then I will turn over to the peoples a pure language that they may all call upon the Name of Adonoy.” And it is said, “On that day Adonoy will be One and His name One.” "
Deuteronomy 7:1,"1And He will cast out. This is an expression of casting away and displacing, and similarly, “And the iron flies off.”"
Deuteronomy 8:1,"1The entire mitzvah. °This can be understood in its plain sense. °There is also a Midrashic explanation: If you began to fulfill a mitzvah, complete it; for the mitzvah carries the name only [it is only accredited] of the one who completes it, as it is said, “And the bones of Yoseif which Bnei Yisroel brought up from Egypt they buried in Shechem.” Now, didn’t Moshe himself attend to them [the bones] to bring them [up from Egypt]? However, since he had no opportunity to complete it, and Bnei Yisroel did complete it, it is called by their name."
Deuteronomy 9:1,"1Greater and more powerful than you. °You are powerful but they are even more powerful than you."
Deuteronomy 10:1,"1At that time. At the end of forty days, He granted me favor, and said, “Carve for yourself,” and, afterward, “Make for yourself an ark.” However, I made the ark first, for, when I arrive with the tablets in hand, where shall I place them? Now this is not the ark which Betzalel made, for they were not engaged with the Tabernacle until after Yom Kippur, since, it was only when he descended from the mountain that he instructed them concerning the construction of the Tabernacle. °And Betzalel made the Tabernacle first, and afterward the ark and the vessels. Hence, this was a different ark; this one went with them when they waged war, while the one Betzalel made did not go to war, except in Eli’s time, when they were punished over it, and it was captured."
Deuteronomy 11:2,"2Know today. °Pay close attention, so that you know and understand, and accept my reprimand. For it is not with your children. °That I now speak, who might say, ‘We do not know, nor have we seen, all this.’ "
Deuteronomy 12:2,"2You must obliterate. °Destroy, then destroy afterward. This teaches that, when destroying idolatry, one must tear out the roots.All of the places where the nations worshipped, etc. °What must you obliterate from them? ‘Their gods on the mountains.’ "
Deuteronomy 13:1,"1Everything. The less significant as well as the greatly consequential. Be careful to fulfill. This adds a negative command to the positive commands stated in this chapter, as “be careful” always denotes a negative command, except that one is not punished with lashes for violating “be careful” when it is added to a positive command. Do not add to it. °Five totafos with the tefilin, five species with the lulav, four benedictions with the priestly benediction. "
Deuteronomy 14:1,"1Do not lacerate yourselves. °Do not inflict lacerations and gashes on your flesh over the dead, as is the custom among the Emorites for you are God’s children, and must therefore appear suitably becoming, rather than lacerated and hairless. Between your eyes. Near the forehead. Elsewhere it is said, “They may not tear bald spots in their heads.” This equates the entire head with the area between the eyes."
Deuteronomy 15:1,"1At the end of seven years. Perhaps seven years for each and every loan? The Torah therefore teaches, “The seventh year is approaching.” If you say that there are seven years for each and every loan? for everyone’s loan, how is it that it is approaching? This teaches that the seven years follow the count of the shemitah cycle. "
Deuteronomy 16:1,"1Take heed of the month of spring. Before it arrives. Take heed that it is compatible with springtime, so that you may bring the omer-mincha- offering. If not, add a month to the year. From Egypt at night. But didn’t they leave by day, as it is said, “On the day after the pascal-offering, the Israelites went out, etc.”? But, because it was at night that Pharoah granted them permission to leave, as it is said, “He called for Moshe and Aharon at night, etc.”"
Deuteronomy 17:1,"1Do not sacrifice, etc., anything bad. °This prohibits causing the pigul disqualification of the sacred offerings through a pernicious statement. Additional derivations are extrapolated from this in the tractate dealing with the slaughter of the sacred offerings. "
Deuteronomy 18:1,"1The entire tribe of Levi. °Whether physically sound or blemished. A portion. In the spoils. Or an inheritance. In the land. Adonoy’s fire offerings. The sacred offerings at the Sanctuary. And His inheritance. °This refers to the extra-Sanctuary sacred items — the terumah-gifts and the tithes. However, they did not receive a complete inheritance among their brethren.Sifrei expounds: "
Deuteronomy 19:3,"3Ready the route. Refuge! Refuge! was emblazoned °at every fork in the road. Divide the borders of your land into three sections. °The distance from the border until the first of the refuge cities should be equivalent to the travelling distance between that city and the second; so, from the second to the third; and so from the third to the opposite border of Eretz Yisroel. "
Deuteronomy 20:1,"1When you go to war. °Scripture positioned going to war here to teach that anyone lacking a body member is not qualified to go to war. °Another interpretation. To teach that if you judge righteously, you will be assured when you go to war, that you will be victorious. Similarly, Dovid said, “I have acted justly and righteously — Do not abandon me to those who would dispossess me.” Against your enemy. °Consider them enemies. °Do not pity them, for they will not pity you. Horse and chariot. In My eyes, they are all like a single horse. Similarly, it says, “You shall strike down Midian as one man.” Similarly, °it says, “When Pharoah’s horse approached.” People who outnumber you. °In your eyes they are numerous, but in My eyes, they are not numerous. "
Deuteronomy 21:2,"2Your elders shall go out. °The most distinguished of your elders. This refers to the supreme Sanhedrin. And measure. °From the spot where the corpse is lying. In the direction of the cities around the corpse. °In every direction, in order to determine which is closest."
Deuteronomy 22:1,"1And conceal yourself. °Avert your eyes as if you don’t notice it.You may not observe ... and conceal yourself. °You may not observe it so as to conceal yourself. This is its plain meaning. °The Rabbis, however, comment: At times, you may conceal yourself, etc. "
Deuteronomy 23:1,"1A man may not marry. °He cannot effect marriage with her — marriage with her is legally invalid. And may not expose the edge of his father’s garment. °His father’s prospective levirate partner, appropriate for his father. But he was already warned concerning her, from “the nakedness of your father’s brother.” °Evidently, to transgress, with her, against two prohibitions, and to place, next to her, “the bastard may not enter,” °to teach that the bastard is only [someone born] of those liable to kares excision; certainly judicial execution, °as no act of incest or adultery subject to judicial execution is exempt from kares excision. "
Deuteronomy 24:1,"1For he found in her something lecherous. °He is then commanded to divorce her, and that she should not find favor in his eyes. "
Deuteronomy 25:1,"1If a quarrel should occur. °They will ultimately approach the court of justice. You may thus conclude that tranquility does not evolve from quarreling. What caused Lot to take leave of the saint? You may say, it was quarreling. And they convict the villain. Perhaps everyone found liable in court is subject to flogging? The Torah therefore teaches, °”Should, the wicked one deserve flogging.” At times he is flogged, and at times he is not flogged. Who, then is liable to flogging? Learn from the context, “You may not muzzle an ox while it threshes” — °a negative commandment unattached to a positive commandment. "
Deuteronomy 26:1,"1When it happens that you come ... and you inherit it and settle it. °This teaches that they were not obligated to bring the first fruits until they conquered the land and apportioned it."
Deuteronomy 27:1,"1Keep all of the commandment. °This denotes constancy. Gardant in Old French."
Deuteronomy 28:4,"4The issue of your cattle. The offspring of your cattle, which the animal sends forth from her stomach. And the flocks of your sheep. As Targum [Onkelos] renders. The Rabbis comment: °Why are they called עַשְׁתָּרוֹת? Because they enrich their owners and strengthen them, like the palisades, which are powerful cliffs. "
Deuteronomy 29:3,"3Yet Adonoy did not grant you a knowledgeable mind. °To recognize God’s benevolence, and adhere to him. Until this day. °I have heard: because on that day, when Moshe presented the Torah scroll to the sons of Levi — as it is written, “He presented it to the kohanim, the sons of Levi” — all Yisroel appeared before Moshe, and said to him: “Our master Moshe, we, too, stood at Sinai. We accepted the Torah, and it was given to us. °How is it that you are empowering your fellow tribesmen over it, so that they may tell us, some day in the future, ‘It was never given to you, it was given to us”’? Moshe rejoiced over this matter, and it was concerning this that he said to them, “This day, you have become a nation, etc.” This day I understand that you are attached to, and crave, the Omnipresent. "
Deuteronomy 30:3,"3Adonoy your God will bring [lit. come] back your returnees. It should have written ‘Bring back’ your returnees. The Rabbis derive from here, that the Divine Presence, with all due reverence, resides with Yisroel in the suffering of their exile, so that, when they are redeemed, He ascribes redemption to Himself — He shall return with them. One may explain additionally: The day of the ingathering of exiles is as momentous and difficult as if He, Himself, would need to carry, literally in His grasp, every individual from his place, °as it is said, “You shall be plucked, one at a time, Bnei Yisroel.” And even with regard to the exiles of other nations we find this, “I shall bring [lit. come] back the returnees of Moav,” [“I shall bring [lit. come] back the returnees of Egypt”]."
Deuteronomy 31:1,"1Moshe went, etc. "
Deuteronomy 32:1,"1Hearken, O heaven. °That I admonish the Israelites, °so that you may serve as witnesses to the matter. For so I informed them — that you would be witnesses. °Similarly, “let the earth hear.” Why did he designate to testify against them heaven and earth? °Moshe said, “I am only flesh and blood, and tomorrow I may die. In case the Israelites declare, ‘We never assumed responsibility for fulfilling the covenant,’ who will refute them”? He therefore designated, to testify against them, heaven and earth, witnesses who endure forever. Furthermore, so that, if they so merit, the witnesses may come and reward them — “The grapevine shall give forth its fruit, the earth give forth its produce, and the heavens give forth their dew.” And if they are blameworthy, the hand of the witnesses may afflict them first — “He shall curb heaven, so that there will be no rain, and the earth shall not give forth its produce.” And after — “You shall quickly perish,” through the Gentile nations. "
Deuteronomy 33:32,"32For their grapevine is of the grapevine of Sedom. The nations’ grapevine. And from the fields of Amorah, etc. But they pay no heed, and do not ascribe the greatness to Me. Their grapes are grapes of bitter herbs. This follows what is said, “Were it not for the enemy’s amassed rage” [v. 27] — against Yisroel, to poison and embitter them. Therefore, let them have bitter clusters, to gorge them for their action against my children. "
Deuteronomy 34:1,"1This is the blessing ... before his death. °Close to his death, for ‘If not now, when’? "
Deuteronomy 35:1,"1From the plains of Moav to Mount Nevo. °There were a number of elevations, but Moshe vaulted them in a single leap. The entire land. °He showed him all of Eretz Yisroel in its tranquility, and the oppressors who are destined to afflict it. Till Don. He showed him the idolatrous sons of Don, as it is said, “The sons of Don established for themselves the idol.” And He showed him Shimshon, who was destined to descend from him as a saviour. "
