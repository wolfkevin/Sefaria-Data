@p11@p2<EN>And He called to Moshe.@p3 For all “speakings” and all sayings @rr°@bband all commands @rr°@bba calling preceded — an expression of love, an expression which the Ministering Angels use, as it is said, “One called to the other.” But to the gentile prophets He revealed himself with an expression of @rr°@bbhappenstance and uncleanness, as it is said, “God happened upon Bilaam.”<QC>
@d1And He called to Moshe.@p3 The voice proceeds @rr°@bband reaches his ears, [but] all Israel do not hear [it]. @rr°@bbPerhaps even for the @ITparoshoh@it-breaks there was a call?<QC>
@rr°@bbThe verse states, “He spoke” — for a speaking there was a calling, [but] not for breaks. What [purpose then] did the breaks serve? @rr°@bbTo give Moshe a breathing space to reflect between each @ITparoshoh@it and between each matter. @rr°@bbHow much more so for an ordinary person who learns from an[other] ordinary person! @d1To him,@p3 @rr°@bbto exclude Aharon [from receiving the @ITparoshoh@it]. @rr°@bbRabbi Yehudoh ben Beseiro says: Thirteen “speakings” are recorded in the Torah [directed] to Moshe and Aharon, and thirteen exclusions corresponding to them, [in order] to teach you that they were not said to Aharon but to Moshe for him to tell Aharon. And these are the thirteen exclusions: “[when Moshe came into the Tent of Meeting that] He might speak @ITto him@it, [he heard the voice] uttering itself @ITto him@it [from above the cover of the Ark of Testimony from between the two @ITcherubim,@it] speaking @ITto him@it,” “and I will meet with you” (@hh<HEB>לְךָ@ee<ENG>), all of them as [interpreted] in @ITToras Kohanim.@it @rr°@bbPerhaps they heard the @ITsound@it of the calling, [though not the exact words]? The verse states: [instead of] @rr°@bb“the voice [uttering itself] @ITto him@it“ (@hh<HEB>לוֹ@ee<ENG> ), [it states] “the voice [uttering itself] @ITto him@it (@hh<HEB>אֵלָיו@ee<ENG>) — Moshe heard but all Israel did not hear. @d1From the Tent of Meeting.@p3 This teaches that the voice broke off and did not leave the tent. Perhaps [this was] because the voice was low? The verse states: “the voice.” What is “the voice”? This is the voice which is explained in Tehillim, “The voice of Adonoy is powerful, the voice of Adonoy is glorious, the voice of Adonoy breaks the cedars.” If so, why is “From the Tent of Meeting” stated? This teaches us that the voice broke off [and did not leave the Tent]. Similarly, “The sound of the wings of the @ITcherubim@it were heard as far as the outer courtyard [of the Temple].” Perhaps the voice was low? The verse states: “Like the voice of Almighty God when He speaks.” If so, why does it state, “As far as the outer courtyard”? Because once it reached there it broke off. @d1From the Tent of Meeting, saying.@p3 Perhaps [the voice sounded] from the entire sanctuary? The verse states: “From over the cover.” Perhaps from the entire cover? The verse states: “From between the two @ITcherubim.@it” @d1Saying.@p3 Go and tell them sobering words: It is for your sake that He speaks to me, for we find that all thirty-eight years that Israel was in the desert, as people who are excommunicated, from [the time] of the spies onward, the prophetic Word had not come to Moshe, as is stated: “When all the men of war ceased to die, God spoke to me, saying.” — “To me” was the speaking. Another interpretation: “Go and tell them My words and answer Me [as to] whether they will accept them,” as is stated, “Moshe reported the words of the people.” @p12@p2<EN>[If] a man among you will bring,@p3 when he brings — the section speaks of @rr°@bbvoluntary sacrifices. @d1A man@p3 [literally, “Adam”]. @rr°@bbWhy is this said? Just as @ITOdom Ho-Rishon@it did not bring [an offering] from stolen property, since everything was his, so should you @rr°@bbnot bring [an offering] from stolen property. @d1Animals.@p3 Perhaps @rr°@bbeven wild animals are included? @rr°@bbThe verse teaches us: Cattle and sheep. @d1Of animals @p3[literally, “of the animal”] — and not @ITall of it@it — [this comes] to exclude [a male animal] @rr°@bbwhich was with a woman or a [female] animal which was with a man. @d1Of cattle.@p3 [this comes] to exclude [an animal] @rr°@bbwhich was worshipped [as an idol].<QC>
@d1Of sheep,@p3 [this comes] to exclude [an animal] @rr°@bbset aside [as an offering to an idol]. @d1Or of sheep,@p3 [this comes] @rr°@bbto exclude a gorer which has killed. [Furthermore,] when it says later on in the section, “of cattle” [in verse 3], the verse comes only to say — to exclude @rr°@bb[an animal] with a fatal defect. @d1You should bring,@p3 [the use of the plural “you”] teaches that @rr°@bbtwo [people] may volunteer a burnt-offering in partnership. @d1Your offering,@p3 this teaches that [the burnt-offering] can come as a voluntary offering of the community — the burnt-offering of the @rr°@bb“summer fruit” for the altar which comes from the surplus.<QC>
@p13@p2<EN>A male,@p3 and not a female. When it says “a male” later on, [verse 10] @rr°@bbit comes only to say — a male, and not [an animal] whose sex cannot be determined or one which has both male and female characteristics. @d1Unblemished,@p3 @rr°@bbwithout a blemish.<QC>
@d1To the entrance of the Tent of Meeting,@p3 [the one who brings the sacrifice] takes care of it @rr°@bbuntil [it is brought to] the [Temple] courts. Why does [the verse] repeat “he shall bring.<TIE>.<TIE>.he shall bring”? @rr°@bbEven if Reuven’s burnt-offering became mixed up with Shimon’s burnt-offering, [the @ITkohein@it] must offer each one in the name of whoever [brought it], and so too [in a case where] a burnt-offering [became mixed up] with a common [animal], let the common [animal] be sold for the purpose of [buying] burnt-offerings, and thus all of them become burnt-offerings, and each one will be offered in the name of whoever [brought it]. Perhaps [this applies] even when [the animal] was mixed up with [animals] @rr°@bbunfit [for a sacrifice], @rr°@bbor [one mixed up with an offering] of another kind? [Thus] the verse comes only to say: “he shall offer @ITit@it.” @d1He shall bring it,@p3 [this further repetition] teaches us @rr°@bbthat they force him [to bring it, once he had taken the vow]. Perhaps even @rr°@bbagainst his will? The verse comes only to say: @hh<HEB>לִרְצוֹנוֹ@ee<ENG> [according to his will]. How can this be? They force him until he says “I want to.” @d1Before Adonoy.<TIE>.<TIE>.and he shall lay [his hand.]@p3 @rr°@bbThere is no laying [of the hand on the sacrificial animal] at a private altar [when such altars were permitted]. @p14@p2<EN>On the head of the burnt-offering,@p3 [the word “burnt-offering” comes] to include an obligatory burnt-offering @rr°@bbfor laying (of hands), and to include a sheep [brought as] a burnt-offering. @d1The burnt-offering,@p3 excluding a bird [offered as] a burnt-offering. @d1And it will be favorably accepted from him.@p3 For what does it provide atonement for him? If you say for [the punishment of] being cut off or execution [ordered] by a court, or death at the hands of heaven or being whipped, their punishment has already been specified. Thus, it atones only for [neglecting] a positive commandment, and @rr°@bba prohibition which is uprooted by a positive commandment. @p15@p2<EN>He shall slaughter, the @BIkohanim@BO will bring.@p3 Receiving [the blood in a vessel] and onward is the command to the priesthood. This teaches that slaughtering is @rr°@bbvalid [even when done by] a non-@ITkohein@it.<QC>
@d1Before Adonoy@p3, @rr°@bbin the [Temple] court. @d1And they will bring.@p3 This [refers to] receiving [the blood in a vessel], which is the first [action required of the @ITkohanim@it], and its meaning is [synonymous] with @rr°@bb“carrying [it to the altar].” We [therefore] have learned that both [receiving and carrying] require a @ITkohein@it. @d1The sons of Aharon.@p3 @rr°@bbPerhaps those unfit? The verse says: “the @ITkohanim@it.” @d1The blood and [they] will sprinkle the blood.@p3 Why does the verse say “blood” “blood,” [that is,] twice? To include [blood] @rr°@bbwhich was mixed with [other blood] of its type [of sacrifice but of another person’s animal] or [blood] of another type [of sacrifice which was mixed with the original blood]. Perhaps [this applies] even [to blood mixed up with that] of unfit [sacrifices] or @rr°@bb“inner” sin-offerings [whose blood requires sprinkling inside the Sanctuary] or @rr°@bb“outer” sin-offerings, @rr°@bbwhere these, [the inner ones, require sprinkling] above [the red line] and it is [sprinkled] below [the red line]? The verse specifies in another place [in verse 11]: @rr°@bb“its blood.” @d1And [they] will sprinkle,@p3 [the @ITkohein@it] @rr°@bbstands below [the altar] and sprinkles from the vessel to the wall of the altar, below the red line against the corners [of the altar]. That is why it is said “all around” — that the blood should be put on the four sides of the altar. Or perhaps he shall place it [the blood] [all around the altar] as a line? The verse says: “and they shall sprinkle,” and it is impossible to draw a line with sprinkling. [On the other hand,] since [it states] “and they shall sprinkle,” perhaps [all that is needed] is one sprinkle? The verse specifies: “all around.” How is this? He makes @rr°@bbtwo application [of the blood by sprinkling] that are four [in direction]. @d1Which is at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.@p3 [Only when the Tent has been put together,] @rr°@bbnot when it is taken apart.<QC>
@p16@p2<EN>He shall skin, etc.@p3 What does the verse [mean] to say: “the burnt-offering”? @rr°@bbTo include all the [different types] of burnt-offerings [under the requirement] of skinning and butchering [“=<TS>severing its limbs”]. @d1It into its pieces@p3, @rr°@bb[but] not its pieces into [smaller] pieces. @p17@p2<EN>[They] shall place a fire.@p3 Even though the fire descends from Heaven, @rr°@bbit is a @ITmitzvoh@it to bring [some fire] by human efforts. @d1The sons of Aharon the @BIkohein@p3, when he [=<TS>Aharon] is @rr°@bbin his role as @ITkohein godol;@it therefore, if he performed the service in the garments of an ordinary @ITkohein@it, his service would be unfit. @p18@p2<EN>The sons of Aharon, the @BIkohanim,@p3 when they are in their role as @ITkohanim@it; therefore, an ordinary @ITkohein@it who performed the service in the eight garments [of the @ITkohein godol@it], his service would be unfit. @d1The limbs, the head@p3, since the head was not included in the skinning and butchering, @rr°@bbsince it was already cut off in the slaughtering; therefore it was necessary to list it separately. @d1And the fat.@p3 Why was [it] stated [separately]? To teach you that he brings up [the fat to the altar] with the head, @rr°@bband covers the throat of the animal, [with the fat,] and this is [for] the honor of Heaven. @d1That is on the altar.@p3 The logs should not @rr°@bbprotrude outside the pile [of wood on the altar]. @p19@p2<EN>A burnt-offering.@p3 He must make it smoke @rr°@bbfor the sake of a burnt-offering. @d1A fire-offering. @p3When he slaughters it, he must slaughter it @rr°@bbfor the sake of the fire. And every “fire-offering” is synonymous with “fire,” @ITfeuchere@it in Old French.@d1 Of pleasing [fragance], @p3[the word @hh<HEB>נִחוֹחַ@ee<ENG> is related to @hh<HEB>נַחַת@ee<ENG>], @rr°@bbsatisfaction before Me, for I commanded [that this be done], and My will was carried out. @p110@p2<EN>And if .<TIE>.<TIE>. from flocks of sheep,@p3 @rr°@bb[The word] “and” adds to the earlier matter. @rr°@bbWhy [then] was there a break [between the sections]? To give Moshe a breathing space to distinguish between each @ITparoshoh@it. @d1From flocks, of lambs, of goats, @p3these are three limitations — excluding [an animal too] old [to be offered], one [that is] ill, and one [that is] filthy.<QC>
@p111@p2<EN>On the side @p3(literally, “thigh”)@d1 of the altar, @p3@rr°@bbon the side of the altar. @d1Northward before Adonoy,@p3 and there is no [rule] of “north” [regarding] a private altar.<QC>
@p114@p2<EN>Of fowl,@p3 @rr°@bbbut not @ITall@it fowl. Since it is stated “an unblemished male of cattle, sheep or goats” — [we learn] that wholeness and maleness [is required] of animal [sacrifices] but wholeness and maleness [is not required] of birds. Perhaps even [a bird] lacking a limb [would be fit as a sacrifice]? The verse specifies: “of the fowl,” [excluding such a bird]. @d1The turtledoves@p3, @rr°@bblarge ones and not small ones. @d1[The] young pigeons,@p3 [literally, “sons of doves”], small ones but not large ones. @d1From the turtledoves or the young pigeons,@p3 @rr°@bbexcluding [birds whose feathers] are becoming bright among either [kind], which is unfit — because it is large compared to the young pigeons and small compared to the turtledoves. @p115@p2<EN>He shall bring it.@p3 He may bring @rr°@bbeven one pigeon. @d1the @BIkohein@BO, and nip,@p3 nipping must not be done with an instrument, but @rr°@bbwith the @ITkohein@it’s own body; he nips with his fingernail @rr°@bbnear the nape and cuts its neck until he reaches the “organs,” and cuts them.<QC>
@d1Its blood shall be squeezed out.@p3 [The word translated as “squeezed out”] is synonymous with “the wringing of the nose” “for extortion is at an end” He squeezes the throat against the wall of the altar, and the blood is squeezed out and descends [down the wall]. @d1He nips, he burns it, [the blood] shall be squeezed out.@p3 Is it possible to say so — @rr°@bbafter he burns it he squeezes [out the blood]? Rather, just as burning it is done with the head separately and the body separately, @rr°@bbso too the nipping. The plain sense of the verse is that @rr°@bbit is transposed: he nips and burns, and before the burning the blood has already been squeezed out. @p116@p2<EN>Its crop,@p3 @rr°@bbthe place of excrement; this is the crop. @d1With its feathers, @p3with its intestines. [The word] @hh<HEB>נוֹצָה@ee<ENG> denotes a disgusting thing, as “For they have become loathsome and fled away” and this is what Onkelos translated “with its excrement.” And this is the interpretation of Abba Yose ben Chanan, who said: He takes the stomach with it [=<TS>with the crop]. [But] our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, said: “He cuts around the stomach with a knife [in the shape] of a trapdoor, and takes it with the feathers along with the skin.” Regarding the burnt-offering of a [domestic] animal, which eats only from its master’s feeding trough, it is said: “The innards and legs he shall wash with water, etc. and [he shall] burn it,” [verse 13], [but] regarding fowl, which are nourished from that which is stolen, it is said: “He shall cast the intestines away,” for it ate of that which was stolen @d1Beside the altar, eastward,@p3 @rr°@bbeast of the ramp. @d1To the place of the ashes,@p3 the place where they place the ashes [from the altar] every morning, and the ashes of the inner altar and the @ITmenoroh;@it all of them @rr°@bbwere [miraculously] absorbed there in their places. @p117@p2<EN>He shall rip it apart,@p3 “ripping apart” [is done] only by hand, and so it says regarding Shimshon, “He ripped it [=<TS>the lion which was attacking] apart as one rips apart a young goat,” etc. @d1By its wings,@p3 with its wings; he does not have to pluck off its wing-feathers. @d1By its wings,@p3 [The word @ITnotzoh@it here] means actual feathers. Is there anyone who smells the odor of burning feathers who does not become disgusted? Why [then] does the verse say “he shall offer [it]”? In order that the altar should be satiated and adorned with the sacrifice of a poor man. @d1Not completely dividing it,@p3 he does not tear it apart completely into two pieces, but rips it apart along its back. “A pleasing fragrance” is said of a bird [sacrifice], and “a pleasing fragrance” is said of an animal [sacrifice], to inform you that whether one does more or one does less — so long as he directs his heart to Heaven. @p11@p2<EN>When a person brings.@p3 “A person” [literally, “a soul”] is not mentioned regarding all the voluntary offerings except the meal-offering. Who is accustomed to bring a meal-offering? A poor person. Said God: I consider him as though he had offered his [own] soul. @d1His offering shall be of fine flour.@p3 Whoever says: @rr°@bbI am obligated [to bring] a meal-offering without specifying [which one] must bring a fine-flour meal-offering, @rr°@bbwhich is the first of the meal-offerings [mentioned], [special in that] its fistful is taken while it is [still] fine flour, as is explained in this section. Since five types of meal-offerings are mentioned here, and all of them are baked before the fistful is taken except for this one, therefore it is called a fine-flour meal-offering. @d1Fine flour.@p3 Fine flour comes only from wheat, as it is said, “fine wheat flour” and no meal-offering [uses] less than a tenth [of an @ITephah@it], as it is said, “a tenth [of an @ITephah@it] fine flour .<TIE>.<TIE>. per meal-offering” — a tenth for each meal-offering. @d1He shall pour oil upon it,@p3 on all of it, @d1and place frankincense upon it,@p3 on part of it. He places a fistful of frankincense on it on one side. Why do you say so? For there is no inclusion after inclusion in the Torah @rr°@bbbut to exclude. Another interpretation: Oil [is poured] on all of it, because it [=<TS>the oil] is mixed with it and its fistful is taken with it, as it is said, “[he takes from there its fistful] @rr°@bbfrom its flour and from its oil,” and the frankincense [is placed] on part of it, since it is not mixed with it and its fistful is not taken with it, as it is said, @d1with all its frankincense,@p3 for after he takes the fistful he gathers frankincense — all of it — from over it and burns it. @d1He shall pour, and he shall place, he shall bring [to the sons of Aharon],@p3 this teaches that pouring and mixing @rr°@bbare valid when done by a non-@ITkohein@it.<QC>
@p12@p2<EN>The @BIkohanim@BO, and he takes [his] fistful — @p3from the taking of the fistful onward is a mitzvoh [which must be fulfilled] by the @hh<HEB>כְּהוּנָה@ee<ENG>. @d1He takes [his] fistful from there — @p3from the place the feet of a non-@ITkohein@it stand — to teach you that the taking of the fistful is valid throughout the courtyard, even in the eleven @ITamoh@its of the place where Israelites may step. @d1his full fistful.@p3 Perhaps it must be full to overflowing — @rr°@bbspilling out at every side? The verse says in another place, “he shall separate from @ITit@it“ — only that which is within the fistful should be valid. If [it is written] “in his fistful,” perhaps it [may be offered] less than full? The verse says: “full.” How is this [done]? He covers the palm of his hand [with] @rr°@bbthree fingers, @rr°@bband this is the meaning of a “fistful” in the Hebrew language. @d1With@bo @BOall its frankincense,@p3 the fistful should be full, aside from the frankincense. @d1Its frankincense and he shall burn — @p3the frankincense @rr°@bbmust also be burned. @d1His fistful from its flour and its oil — @p3thus if he took the fistful, and a grain of salt came into his hand or @rr°@bba particle of frankincense [came into his hand] it is not valid. @d1Its memorial portion,@p3 the fistful which goes up to [the altar] to the Most High is the memorial of the meal-offering, because with it its owners are remembered for good and [having caused] satisfaction.<QC>
@p13@p2<EN>To Aharon and his sons.@p3 The @ITkohein@it @ITGodol@it @rr°@bbtakes a portion first, without [having to participate in a] distribution, [while] an ordinary @ITkohein@it [shares in the] distribution. @d1Holy of holies,@p3 it is for them which is @d1of the fire-offerings of Adonoy.@p3 They have no part of it until @rr°@bbafter the fire-offering [=<TS>the fistful] was made.<QC>
@p14@p2<EN>And when you bring, etc.@p3 For he said: I am obligated to bring a meal-offering @rr°@bbbaked in an oven. The verse teaches us that he should bring either matzoh-loaves @rr°@bbor matzoh wafers, the loaves mixed [with oil] and the wafers smeared [with oil]. @rr°@bbOur Rabbis disagree on their smearing; some say he smears them again and again until all the oil in the @hh<HEB>לוֹג@ee<ENG> is used up, because all the meal offerings require a @hh<HEB>לוֹג@ee<ENG> of oil, and some say he smears [the oil in the shape] like [that of the Greek letter] “chi” [@ch÷@ee], and the remainder is eaten by the @ITkohanim@it separately. Why does the verse say: ‘‘in oil .<TIE>.<TIE>. in oil’’ twice? @rr°@bbTo permit oil of the second or third [pressing] issuing from the olives. Oil of the first [pressing] is required only for the Menoroh, for [the word] ‘‘pure’’ is said [in connection] with it. We learned in [Maseches] Menochos: All the meal-offerings which are baked before their fistful is taken, and their fistful is taken by breaking [the loaves or wafers into pieces] — all of them come [in groups] of @rr°@bbten loaves, and those of which it is said ‘‘wafers’’ come [in groups] of ten wafers. @p15@p2<EN>And if a pan-baked meal-offering,@p3 for he said: I am obligated [to bring] a pan-baked meal-offering. [The pan] was a vessel [used] in the Temple, in which they would bake this meal-offering in oil on the fire; the vessel was not deep but flat, and the resulting meal-offering made in it was hard, since it was flat, @rr°@bbthe fire burnt the oil. And all of them require three applications of oil: @rr°@bbpouring, mixing @rr°@bband placing of oil in the vessel before they are prepared. @d1Fine flour mixed with oil, @p3[this] teaches that he mixes them while they are still flour. @p16@p2<EN>Break it into pieces,@p3 @rr°@bbto include all the meal-offerings which are baked before their fistful is taken [to be included] in [the law of] “breaking into pieces.” @d1Pour oil on it; it is a meal-offering — @p3to include all the meal-offerings [in the requirement] of “pouring.” @rr°@bbPerhaps even a meal-offering baked in an oven [requires pouring]? The verse says: “on it.” Should I exclude the loaves and not exclude the wafers? The verse says: “It.” @p17@p2<EN>Pan.@p3 This is a vessel which was in the Temple, [which was] deep, and because it was deep, its oil was gathered [at its bottom], and the fire did not burn it. Therefore, the resulting meal-offering within it appeared as though it was creeping everything soft because of the liquid contained in it appears as though [it is] creeping and moving. @p18@p2<EN>That will be made in any of these,@p3 @rr°@bbin any of these types. @d1[And] he@bo — @rr°@bbthe owners — @BOshall bring it,@bo to the @ITkohein.@it @BOAnd he [the @BIkohein@BO] will present it to the altar.@p3 He presents it @rr°@bbto the southwest corner of the altar. @p19@p2<EN>Its memorial portion,@p3 that is @rr°@bbthe fistful. @p111@p2<EN>And all honey.@p3 Any @rr°@bbsweet [juice] of a fruit is called “honey.”<QC>
@p112@p2<EN>You shall bring them as a first [fruit-]offering.@p3 What must you bring from sourdough and from honey? A first [fruit]-offering — two [loaves of] bread of Shavuos which come from sourdough, as it is said, “unleavened shall they be baked” [along with] first-fruits from the honey, such as the first-fruits of figs and dates. @p113@p2<EN>Salt, covenant.@p3 For a covenant was made for salt from the Six Days of Creation, when the lower waters were promised to be brought onto the altar in the form of salt @rr°@bband the water-offering on Sukkos.<QC>
@d1On every offering,@p3 on the burnt-offering of [domestic] animal and bird and on the fat-portions of all sacrifices in general.<QC>
@p114@p2<EN>When you bring.@p3 Behold, @hh<HEB>אִם@ee<ENG> functions @rr°@bbas meaning “when,” for this is not voluntary, since the verse deals with the @ITomer@it meal-offering, which is obligatory. Similarly, “and @rr°@bbwhen there will be a jubilee year, etc.” @d1Meal-offering of first grains.@p3 The verse deals with an @ITomer@it meal-offering, which @rr°@bbcomes fresh, at the time of the ripening of the crops, and it comes from barley: @hh<HEB>אָבִיב@ee<ENG> [“fresh, ripe”] it is stated here and “it is stated elsewhere” “the barley was green.” @d1Roasted over fire,@p3 [It is parched,] since they dry it over fire in a roaster’s [perforated iron] tube, for were it not so, it could not be ground in a mill, for it is moist. @d1Ground kernels,@p3 broken when yet moist. @hh<HEB>גֶרֶשׂ@ee<ENG> means “crushing” and “grinding.” He grinds it in a mill of grist-grinders, similar to [the meaning of @ITgoras@it in the verse] “he broke [my teeth] with gravel,” and similarly, “my soul is crushed.” @rr°@bb@d1Kernels@p3, while the husk is full, when the grain is moist and full in its stalks. That is why the fresh ears [of corn] are called @ITkarmel@it, and similarly, “fresh ears [of corn] in his sack.” @p11@p2<EN>Peace-offering. @p3[They are called peace-offerings] because they bring peace into the world. Another interpretation: “Peace-offerings” because they contain peace for the altar, for the @ITkohanim@it and for the owners.<QC>
@p13@p2<EN>And all the fat on the innards, etc. @p3[The word “all”] includes @rr°@bbthe fat on the stomach — the words of Rabbi Yishmo’el; Rabbi Akiva says: [This comes] to include the fat on the small intestines.<QC>
@p14@p2<EN>The flanks. @p3@ITFlancs@it in Old French, for the fat which is on the kidneys when the animal is alive is at the height of the flanks below, and this is the fat which is under the loins — called @ITlombles@it in Old French — the white [fat] which is seen at the height of the flanks, and beneath it flesh covers it. @d1The lobe@p3, that is the @rr°@bbseparating wall [=<TS>the diaphragm] which they call @ITebres@it [in Old French], and in Aramaic: “the lobe of @rr°@bbthe liver.” @d1On the liver.@p3 He should take a little of the liver with it, @rr°@bband in another place it says: “the lobe from the liver.” @d1On the liver on the kidneys,@p3 [that is,] aside from the liver and @rr°@bbaside from the kidneys — he should remove this [also]. @p15@p2<EN>With the burnt-offering, @p3aside from the burnt-offering.

@p117@p2<EN>An everlasting statute. @p3@rr°@bbThis entire verse is well explained in Toras Kohanim. @p12@p2<EN>Any commandment of Adonoy. @p3Our Rabbis explained: A sin-offering comes only for something whose intentional violation [involves] @rr°@bba negative commandment and [the penalty] of @ITkareis.@it @d1One of these,@p3 part of one of them, such as one who writes on Shabbos, Shem of Shimon, @rr°@bbNoach of Nochor, Don of Doniel. @p13@p2<EN>If the anointed @BIkohein@BO should sin to bring guilt on the people,@p3 Its midrashic interpretation: He is not obliged [to bring a sin-offering] unless there is a hidden thing together @rr°@bbwith an unintentional [illegal] act, as it is said, “to bring guilt on the people” “and something is hidden from the congregation and they do.” And its plain meaning according to the @ITaggodoh@it: When the @ITkohein godol@it sins, it [results] in the guilt of the people, for they are dependent on him to atone for them and pray for them — and [now] he has become impaired. @d1Bullock@p3 [literally, “a bullock, son of cattle.”] @rr°@bbPerhaps an old one? The verse says: “son.” If a son, perhaps a young one? The verse says: “a bullock.” How is this? This [refers to] a three-year old bullock.<QC>

@p17@p2<EN>And all the blood,@p3 @rr°@bbthe remaining blood. @p18@p2<EN>And all the fat of the bullock [of the sin-offering].@p3 [The verse] should have stated “its fat.” Why does the verse state “[the fat] of the bullock”? To include @rr°@bbthe bullock [offered] on Yom Kippur [under the rule regarding] the kidneys, the fats and the lobe [on the liver]. @d1The sin-offering,@p3 to include @rr°@bbthe goats [brought as a sin-offering] for idolatry [under the rule regarding] the kidneys, the fats and the lobe [on the liver]. @d1He shall separate from it, @rr°@bb@p3from that which is still attached — [to teach us] that he should not butcher it before the removal of the fat. (Toras Kohanim) @p110@p2<EN>In the same manner as they were separated,@p3 from those fats [for burning] explained regarding an ox [offered] for a peace-offering. @rr°@bbBut what was explained in regard to a peace-offering that was not explained here? Rather, to compare this to a peace-offering. @rr°@bbJust as peace-offerings [must be offered] for their own sake, so this [must be offered] for its own sake; and just as peace-offering [bring] peace to the world, so this [brings] peace to the world. And [it is taught] @ITShechitas Kodoshim,@it [that the verse] is required to derive from it [the rule] that we may not derive a @rr°@bblaw from a law [which itslf was derived from scripture] regarding Holy Things [=<TS>sacrifices] — in the Chapter Ezehu Mekoman [=<TS>Zevochim, 49b]. @p111@p2<EN>On the liver, on the kidneys,@bo@BO with its head, and feet@p3 — all of them [=<TS> all the “on’s” mentioned in these verses] are expressions of “addition,” as [the word] “besides.”<QC>
@p112@p2<EN> To a pure [undefiled] place.@p3 Since there is outside the city a place prepared for impurity — [in which] to throw out stones stricken with plague, and [set aside] for a cemetery — it was necessary to state that “beyond the encampment,” which is outside the city [=<TS>Jerusalem], that the place should be pure. @d1Beyond the encampment, @p3@rr°@bbbeyond the three encampments, and in the Temple, [this means] @rr°@bboutside the city [of Jerusalem], as our Rabbis explained it in Maseches Yomo and in Sanhedrin. @d1Where the ashes are thrown,@p3 @rr°@bba place in which they spill the ashes removed from the altar, as it is said, “He shall take the ashes out beyond the encampment [to a pure place].” @d1It shall be burned where the ashes are thrown.@p3 Though the verse did not have to say [this] except to teach that [the bullock is burnt] even if @rr°@bbthere are no ashes there.<QC>
@p113@p2<EN>Congregation of Yisroel, @p3this [refers to] @rr°@bbthe @ITsanhedrin@it. @d1The matter [that error] was concealed,@p3 they erred in a decision regarding an [act which leads to a punishment of] @ITkerisos@it [mentioned] in the Torah — [ruling] that it is permitted. @d1The community and they did,@p3 @rr°@bbthat the community acted according to their decision.<QC>
@p117@p2<EN>In front of the curtain. @p3[But] above it says: “In front of the @ITHoly@it Curtain.” [Why the change in terminology?] It may be compared to a king against whom a province rebelled; if the smaller portion of it rebelled, his court continues to exist. But if all of it rebelled, his court does not continue to exist. So too here. When the anointed @ITkohein@it [=<TS>the @ITkohein godol@it] sinned, there is still the designation of sanctity on the Temple; when all of them sin, God forbid, the holiness is removed. @p118@p2<EN>The base of the altar of the burnt-offering which is at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.@p3 This [refers] to the western base which is @rr°@bbopposite “the entrance [of the Tent of Meeting or Sanctuary].”<QC>
@p119@p2<EN>He shall remove all its fat. @p3Even though the lobe and two kidneys are not specified here, they learn this from “he shall do to the bullock as he did [to the sin-offering].” Why was this not explained here? It was taught in the School of R. Yishmo’el: This may be compared to a king who became angry with his friend, [but] minimized his sin because of his love for him. @p120@p2<EN>He shall do to@bo — @rr°@bbthis — @BObullock as he did to the sin-offering bullock@p3, as explained in regard to the bullock of the anointed @ITkohein@it [=<TS> the @ITkohein godol@it] — to include @rr°@bbthe lobe and two kidneys — for he explained there what he didn’t explain here, and to repeat the @ITmitzvos@it of the [Temple] services, @rr°@bbto teach that if he omitted one of all the applications [of blood], it is invalid. Because we have found [elsewhere] that [if blood] which had to be placed on the outer altar that if he placed it @rr°@bbwith only one application — he has [nevertheless effected] the atonement, it was necessary to say here, that [the omission of] any one of these impedes [the atonement]. @p122@p2<EN>If a leader sins.@p3 @rr°@bbAn expression of “fortunate is.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Fortunate is the generation whose leader is concerned to bring an atonement for his inadvertent transgression — all the more so that he regrets his intentional transgressions. @p123@p2<EN>Or [if his sin] becomes known [to him],@p3 similar to “@ITif@it the matter becomes known. There are many “or’s” which serve [the same purpose] as the expression “if,” and “if” in place of “or.” Similarly, “@ITor@it [=<TS>if] it became known that the ox is a gorer.”<QC>
@d1It becomes known to him.@p3 When he sinned he thought that it was permitted, and afterwards he became aware that it was forbidden. @p124@p2<EN>In the place where the burnt-offering is slaughtered,@p3 @rr°@bbin the north [of the altar], which is explained in regard to the burnt-offering. @d1It is a sin-offering,@p3 [when it is offered for] its sake, it is valid; when @rr°@bbnot for its sake, it is invalid. @p125@p2<EN>And its blood — @rr°@bb@p3the remnants of its blood.<QC>

@p135@p2<EN>As the fat of the lamb was removed,@p3 whose fats [burnt on the altar] were increased by [the addition] of the fat tail, so too the sin-offering, when it comes [as a] lamb, requires [that] the fat tail [be burnt] with fats. @d1On the fires of Adonoy,@p3 @rr°@bbon the fires which are made for God [by human effort], @IT foailles@it in Old French. @p11@p2<EN> And heard an oath,@p3 in a matter @rr°@bbin which he is a witness, for which they made him take an oath that if he knows some testimony for him [=<TS>one of the disputants] he must testify for him. @p12@p2<EN>Or, if a person touches [anything impure],@p3 @rr°@bband after this impurity he eats holy [sacrificial] food or enters the Temple, which is a matter whose intentional trespass [involves] @ITkoreis@it.

@p18@p2<EN>He shall bring that which is for a sin-offering first, @p3a sin-offering precedes a burnt-offering. To what may this be compared? To an advocate who entered [the palace] to obtain pardon for his client. [Once] the advocate gains the pardon, the gift [the @hh<HEB>עוֹלָה@ee<ENG>] is brought in after him. @d1[He does] not separate [the head entirely],@p3 he only nips @rr°@bbone organ.<QC>
@d1Neck,@p3 that is the slope of the head which inclines toward the neck. @d1Back of the neck, @p3close by [that part of the back of the head] which “sees” the neck — that is, the length of the entire back of the neck. @p19@p2<EN>He shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin-offering.@p3 Regarding a burnt-offering only squeezing was required, [but] regarding a sin-offering, [both] sprinkling and squeezing out [are required]; he seizes the back of the head and makes [the blood] spurt out, and the blood spurts out and reaches the altar. @d1It is a sin-offering, @p3[offered] for its sake, it is valid; [if] not @rr°@bbfor its sake, it is invalid. @p110@p2<EN>As prescribed,@p3 @rr°@bbaccording to the rule regarding a free-will fowl burnt-offering mentioned at the beginning of the @ITparoshoh@it.<QC>
@p111@p2<EN>Because it is a sin-offering,@p3 and so it is not proper that it should be embellished [with oil or frankincense]. @p112@p2<EN>It is a sin-offering,@p3 if a fistful is taken and it is burned for its sake, it is valid; [if] @rr°@bbnot for its sake, it is invalid.<QC>
@p113@p2<EN>For his@bo @BOsin that he committed.@p3 Here the verse has changed [its phraseology], for in regard to the rich and poor [sacrifices] “for his sin” is mentioned, [while] here in regard to the poorest of the poor, “On his sin” is mentioned. Our Rabbis derived from [these minute considerations] here that if he sinned when he was rich and put aside money for a lamb or goat, and [then] became poor, he need bring [only] two turtledoves from part [of the money set aside]. [If] he had set aside money for two turtledoves and [then] became poor, he need bring [only] a tenth of an ephah from part [of the money set aside]; [if] he set aside money for a tenth of an ephah and became rich, he must add to them and bring the sacrifice [due from] a rich man. Therefore it is said here: @ITon@it his sacrifice, [i.e., in addition to his sacrifice]. @d1In one of these,@p3 in one @rr°@bbof these three [forms of] atonement mentioned in regard to this matter — either for rich, or for poor, or for the poorest of the poor. What does the verse say? Perhaps the most severe of them [=<TS>sins] [requires] a lamb or goat, @rr°@bband the less severe [requires] a fowl, while the least severe [require] a tenth of an @ITephah@it? The verse says: “in one of these,” to equate the least to the most severe [sin], for a lamb and goat, if he can afford it, and the most severe to the least [sin], for a tenth of an @ITephah@it for the poorest of the poor. @d1And it shall belong to the @BIkohein@BO as a meal-offering,@p3 to teach [us] regarding a sinner’s meal-offering, that @rr°@bbits remnants should be eaten — this is according to its plain meaning, [but] our Rabbis expounded: “and it should belong to the @ITkohein@it“ — and if this sinner is [himself] a @ITkohein@it — this should be like [any] other free-will meal-offering of a @ITkohein@it, which “shall be @rr°@bbcompletely burnt, it should not be eaten.” @p115@p2<EN>Wrongfully deviates@p3 @hh<HEB>מְעִילָה@ee<ENG> wherever it occurs @rr°@bb[means] “changing.” Similarly, it says: “They deviated from the God of their fathers, and went astray after the gods of the peoples of the land,” and similarly it says in regard to a suspected adulteress, “she committed a @hh<HEB>מַעַל@ee<ENG> [=<TS>she acted faithlessly]. @d1And unwittingly sins [by using] the sacred property of Adonoy, @p3[in] that he benefitted from sacred property. @rr°@bbAnd where was he warned [against doing this]? @hh<HEB>חֵטְא@ee<ENG> (=<TS>sin) is mentioned here, and @hh<HEB>חֵטְא@ee<ENG>(=<TS>sin) is mentioned later on regarding @hh<HEB> תְּרוּמָה@ee<ENG>, “that they not bear the burden of sin for it.” Just as there He warned [against misappropriating @hh<HEB>תְּרוּמָה@ee<ENG>], so too here He warned [against misappropriating sacred property]. [Perhaps] just as there Scripture warned only @rr°@bbagainst eating [@hh<HEB>תְּרוּמָה@ee<ENG>], so too here scripture warned only against eating [sacred property]? The verse says: @rr°@bb<HS>@hh<HEB>תִמְעֹל מַעַל@ee<ENG> —  it [thus] includes [even actions aside from eating]. @d1Of the sacred property of Adonoy, @p3[referring] to that which is specifically God’s, @rr°@bbexcluding sacrifices of lesser holiness. @d1A ram,@p3 [a word @rr°@bbimplying] “toughness, might,” such as “and he took the mighty (@ITeylei@it) of the land.” Here too [it implies] “might” — a two year old [ram]. @d1A valuation of silver @BIshekalim,@p3 that it should be @rr°@bbworth two @ITselaim.@it @p116@p2<EN>And that which he sinned [making use] of the sacred property, must pay.@p3 @rr°@bbThe principal and the fifth to the Temple treasury.<QC>
@p117@p2<EN>He is uncertain and incurs guilt, he shall bring.@p3 This section speaks of one to whom there occured a doubtful [case] of @ITkareis@it, and he does not know whether he transgressed or not, as for example [where there were pieces of] forbidden fat and permitted fat before him. He thought that both were permitted, and ate one. He was then told, “One was of forbidden fat,” and he does not know whether he ate the one of forbidden fat — this person brings an uncertain guilt offering, [which] protects him as long as he does not know for certain that he sinned, and if he becomes aware after a time [that he did sin], he [then] brings a [regular] sin-offering. @d1He is uncertain and incurs guilt and bears his iniquity.@p3 Rabbi Yose the Galilean says: Behold, Scripture punished one who was unaware, how much more so will it punish one who is aware [of his sin]. Rabbi Yosi says: If you wish to know the [extent of] the reward of the righteous, go and learn from @ITOdom HoRishon,@it who was commanded only [one] negative commandment, and transgressed against it — see how many deaths were exacted against him and his descendants. And which measure [of God] is greater, that of good [reward] or that of punishment? You must say: that of good [reward]. If the measure of punishment is the lesser [of the two], see how many deaths were exacted against him and his descendants, [you may calculate] the greater measure of reward [for one] who refrains from [the sin of] @hh<HEB>פִּגוּל@ee<ENG> or @hh<HEB>נוֹתָר@ee<ENG>, or one who fasts on Yom Kippur — how much more so will he bring merit on himself and on his descendants and his descendants’ descendants to the end of all generations. Rabbi Akiva says: Behold, it says: “By the [testimony] of two witnesses or three, etc.” if the testimony is valid with two [witnesses], why did the verse specify “three”? Rather, to include the third to be severe with him, and to make his judgement similar to these [other two], in regard to the punishment of @hh<HEB>הֲזָמָה@ee<ENG>. If the verse punishes one who joins those who commit a crime as [severely] as those who actually commit the crime, how much more so will it give a reward to one who joins those who do a @ITmitzvah@it as those who [actually] do the @ITmitzvah@it! Rabbi Eleazar son of Azariah says: “When you harvest your harvest in your field, and you forget a sheaf in the field,” behold it says [afterward] “in order that He bless you, etc.” — the verse establishes a blessing for one to whom a @ITmitzvah@it comes [even] without his knowing. You may conclude from this: If a @ITsela@it was bound up in [the] corners [of his garment], and it dropped from it, and a poor person found it and supports himself with it, behold, God establishes a blessing for him. @p118@p2<EN>Valuation as a guilt offering, @rr°@bb@p3in the value recorded above [=<TS>two @ITshekalim@it].<QC>
@d1Which he did unintentionally, and he did not know. @p3Thus if he did realize after a time, this guilt offering does not atone for him until he brings a sin-offering. Behold, what does this resemble? [The case of] a heifer whose neck is to be broken [to atone for a murder whose perpetrator is unknown] whose neck was broken, and afterwards the murderer was found — that one [=<TS>the murderer] must be executed [even though an atonement was made with the heifer]. @p119@p2<EN>It is a guilt offering [for] he has incurred guilt. @p3The first [word (@hh<HEB>אָשָׁם@ee<ENG>)] is altogether [vocalized] with a @ITkamatz@it, for it is a noun [=<TS>“guilt”], while the last [word] is half @ITkametz@it and half @ITpatach@it, for it is a verb [=<TS>“he has incurred”]. And if you say that this is a verse which is not needed, it is expounded in Toras Kohanim (=<TS>Sifra): @d1It is a guilt offering; he has incurred guilt, @p3to include @rr°@bbthe guilt offering [brought by one] [who seduced] an engaged maidservant that it should [consist] of a two-year old ram worth two @ITshekalim.@it Perhaps I should include the guilt offering for a nazirite and the guilt offering of a @ITmetzoro@it. The verse says: “It is.”<QC>
@p121@p2<EN>If a person sins. @p3Said Rabbi Akiva: Why does the verse say: @hh<HEB>וּמָעֲלָה מַעַל@ee<ENG> @rr°@bb(acted faithlessly with Hashem?) Since everyone who lends or borrows or conducts business only does [so] @rr°@bbwith witnesses and a document, therefore when he denies [the truth of the transaction], he denies [the testimony] of the witnesses and document, but when one deposits [something] with his fellow [for storage], he does not want any soul to know [of this transaction] except @rr°@bbthe Third between them [=<TS>God].

@d1And he shall separate the ashes.@p3 He would rake a full pan @rr°@bbof consumed ashes — @rr°@bbthe innermost — and place them @rr°@bbon the east [side] of the ramp. @d1The ashes [which are formed] when the fire consumes the burnt-offering — @p3@rr°@bband makes them ashes.

@p14@p2<EN>He shall remove his garments,@p3 this is not obligatory, but good manners, [in order] that he not dirty while taking out the ashes the clothes in which he performs [the Temple service] steadily. @rr°@bbClothes in which he cooked the pot for his master, he should not pour the goblet for his master in them. Therefore [the verse continues]: “and dress in other garments,” of lesser worth than [these]. @d1He shall take out the ashes@p3 @rr°@bbwhich are gathered in the heap [at the center of the altar]. When there is a great deal [of ash], and there is no place on the wood pile, he removes it from there. [But] this is not an obligation every day, but the @ITterumoh@it is obligatory every day. @p15@p2<EN>The fire on the altar shall be kindled with it — @p3 [the Torah] here mentioned many kindlings, “on its pyre,” “the fire of the altar shall be kindled with it” “the fire on the altar shall be kindled with it,” “a continual fire shall be alight on the altar.” All of them are expounded in Maseches Yomo, [where] @rr°@bbour Rabbis differed on the number of woodpiles which were there.<QC>
@d1And arrange the burnt-offering on it,@p3 the daily burnt-offering should precede [all other sacrifices]. @d1Fats of the peace-offering,@p3 @rr°@bbif a peace-offering is brought there.

@d1It shall not go out.@p3 One who extinguishes the fire on the altar transgresses @rr°@bbtwo prohibitions. @p17@p2<EN>This is the law of the meal-offering,@p3 there is one law for all of them, @rr°@bbto require oil and frankincense, which are mentioned in the section [dealing with them].

The verse says: “the law of.” @d1Bring it,@p3 @rr°@bbthat is bringing near, @rr°@bbto the southwest corner [of the altar]. @d1Before Adonoy,@p3 that is the west [side of the altar], which is on the side of the Tent of Meeting. @d1To the front of the altar,@p3 that is the south, which is the “face” of the altar, for the ramp is placed in that direction. @p18@p2<EN>He shall separate from it,@p3 from that which is united [as one mass], [this teaches] that there should be a full tenth of an [ephah] in the vessel at one time when he takes the fistful.<QC>

@p19@p2<EN>In a sacred place.@p3 What is that? @rr°@bbIn the courtyard of the Tent of Meeting. @p110@p2<EN>It should not be baked [as] leavened, their portion,@p3 @rr°@bbeven the left-over portions [eaten by the @ITkohanim@it] are prohibited when leavened. @d1As the sin-offering and as the guilt-offering,@p3 the meal-offering of a sinner is @rr°@bblike a sin-offering, therefore [if the @ITkohein@it] took the fistful not for its sake, it is invalid.

Why [=<TS>regarding to what aspect of the priesthood] is this said? If for eating [whatever the @ITkohein@it is given as his portion], it was already stated: “the food of his God of the holiest offering [shall he eat]!

@p113@p2<EN>This is the offering of Aharon and his sons,@p3 @rr°@bbeven ordinary @ITkohanim@it offer [the] tenth of an ephah on the day when they are inaugurated into the Temple service, but [as for] a @ITKohein Godol@it — [he offers it] every day, as it is stated, “a continual meal-offering [half of it in the morning, half of it in the evening],” etc. “The @ITkohein@it @rr°@bbwho is anointed in his stead from among his sons [shall also do it], an everlasting statute.”<QC>
@p114@p2<EN>Saturated,@p3 scalded in boiling water as much as needed. @d1Well-baked,@p3 baked many times; after its scalding he bakes it @rr°@bbin an oven, and thereupon fries it in a pan. @d1A meal-offering of broken pieces,@p3 this teaches that it requires @rr°@bbbreaking. @p115@p2<EN>[The @BIkohein@BO] who is anointed in his stead from among his sons,@p3 @rr°@bbthe one anointed of his sons [to serve] in his stead. @d1It shall be entirely burnt,@p3 a fistful is not taken for the remnants to be eaten, but @rr°@bball of it is completely [burnt], and @rr°@bbso too: @p116@p2<EN>Every meal-offering of a @ITkohein@it — @p3of a voluntary offering —  @d1shall be completely [burnt]. Completely,@p3 all of it @rr°@bbequally, to the Most High. @p119@p2<EN>[The @BIkohein@BO] who offers it as a sin-offering,@p3 the one who performs its service, through which it is made into a sin-offering. @d1[The @BIkohein@BO] who offers it as a sin-offering shall eat it.@p3 @rr°@bbOne fit [to perform] the Temple service — excluding one who was [ritually] unclean at the time of sprinkling the blood, who does not share in the meat. It is impossible to say that [this verse] forbids other @ITkohanim@it from eating it, aside from the one who sprinkles its blood, for it is said below, “Every male among the @ITkohanim@it shall eat it.”<QC>
@p120@p2<EN>Whatever shall touch its flesh,@p3 every foodstuff @rr°@bbwhich touches and absorbs from it, @d1Shall become holy,@p3 to become like it, if it [=<TS>the sin-offering] is invalid, it [=<TS>foodstuff] becomes invalid, and if it [=<TS>the sin-offering] is valid, it [=<TS>the foodstuff] may be eaten according to the stringent rule of the sin-offering. @d1And when of its blood is sprinkled on the garment.@p3 If [something] of its blood is sprinkled on the garment, that @rr°@bbbloodspot on the garment whereon it was sprinkled you shall wash @rr°@bbin the [Temple] court. @d1Whatever it is sprinkled,@p3 it will have been sprinkled, as [in the verse]: “Neither will their produce extend to the earth” — it will be stretched out. @p121@p2<EN>Must be broken,@p3 because the liquid absorbed in it @rr°@bbbecomes @hh<HEB>נוֹתָר@ee<ENG>, and the same is true of all the holy [offerings]. @d1And scoured,@p3 an expression like “cleansing ointments for women,” @ITescourement@it in Old French. @d1Scoured and rinsed,@p3 to cause it to discharge its absorbed [liquids]; but [as for] earthenware pots, the verse teaches us here, that [absorbed liquids] never leave its walls.<QC>
@p122@p2<EN>Every male among the @BIkohanim@BO may eat it.@p3 Thus you learn that “the one who offers it as a sin-offering” — mentioned above — [was not mentioned] in order to exclude other @ITkohanim@it, but to exclude one who is not fit for bringing it as a sin-offering. @p123@p2<EN>And every sin-offering, etc.@p3 If he brought in [some of] the blood of an “outer” sin-offering within, it is invalid. @d1And every,@p3 to include other sacrifices. @p11@p2<EN>It is most holy.@p3 It is offered, @rr°@bbbut its exchange is not offered. @p12@p2<EN> (They will slaughter,@p3 [the verse] has given us many slaughters. Though we have not found a guilt-offering [offered on behalf] of a community, it is said, “@ITthey@it will slaughter” — a plural, and he [=<TS>R. Eliezer] attributed it to a burnt-offering, to include a communal burnt-offering [for the requirement that the slaughter] be in the north [of the altar].) @p13@p2<EN>And all its fat, etc.@p3 Until here it has not been set forth the fats [to be burnt on the altar] in regard to the guilt-offering. Therefore, it was necessary to set them out here. However, [burning the fats of] the sin offering, has already been set forth in the section of Vayikra. @d1The [fat] tail,@p3 since the guilt-offering is brought only from a @rr°@bbram or lamb, and a ram and lamb have [already] been included [in the requirement that] the fat tail [be burnt]. @p15@p2<EN>It is a guilt-offering —@p3 until its name is removed from it. This teaches us regarding a guilt-offering @rr°@bbwhose owners have died or whose owners @rr°@bbhave been atoned for, even though its value is destined to ascend the unemployed (lit., summertime) altar; if it was slaughtered without any designation, it is invalid for a burnt-offering before it is removed for pasture. [This phrase] does not come to teach [us] regarding a guilt-offering that it is invalid [when offered] not for its own sake, as they expounded [the word] @IThu’@it, “it is” which is written in [the section regarding] a sin-offering, because [regarding a] guilt-offering it is said “it is a guilt-offering” only after its fats have been burnt [on the altar], while [the guilt-offering] itself @rr°@bbeven though its fats have not been burnt is valid. @p16@p2<EN>It is most holy,@p3 this is expounded in Toras Kohanim [=<TS>Sifra].<QC>
@p17@p2<EN>One law applies to them both,@p3 in regard to this matter. @d1The @BIkohein@BO who will bring about atonement with it,@p3 @rr°@bbthe one who is fit to [accomplish] atonement shares in it, excluding a @hh<HEB>טְבוּל יוֹם@ee<ENG>, a @hh<HEB>מְחוּסַר כִּפּוּרִים@ee<ENG> and an @hh<HEB>אוֹנֵן@ee<ENG>. @p18@p2<EN>The skin of the burnt-offering that he brought shall belong to the @BIkohein@BO, it shall belong to him,@p3 @rr°@bbexcluding a @hh<HEB>טְבוּל יוֹם@ee<ENG> @rr°@bband a @hh<HEB>מְחוּסַר כִּפּוּרִים@ee<ENG> and an @hh<HEB>אוֹנֵן@ee<ENG>, @rr°@bbwho do not share in the skin. @p19@p2<EN>To the @BIkohein@BO who offers it, etc.@p3 Perhaps [the means] to him alone? The verse says: @d1[It] shall belong to all the sons of Aharon.@p3 Perhaps to all of them? The verse says: @BO“to the @BIkohein@BO who offers.”@bo How is this? [It belongs] @rr°@bbto the priestly family [officiating on] that day the [the sacrifice] was offered. @p110@p2<EN>Mixed with oil,@p3 this is @rr°@bba voluntary meal-offering. @d1Or dry@p3, this is the meal-offering of a sinner, and the meal-offering of jealousy, which have no oil [and are therefore dry]. @p112@p2<EN>If he brings it as a thanksgiving offering,@p3 if [he brings the offering] regarding a matter of thanksgiving for a miraculous act which occured to him —  such as [those which happen] to seafarers or those who traverse deserts or those incarcerated in prisons or a sick person who was healed — [all these are among those] who must give thanks, for it is written regarding them: “Let them thank God for His graciousness and His wonders for humankind, and let them sacrifice thanksgiving offerings.” If it is because of one of these situations that he vowed these peace-offerings then they are peace-offerings of thanksgiving, and require [the loaves of] bread recorded in the section, and are eaten for [only] a day and night, as set forth here.<QC>
@d1He shall bring along with his thanksgiving offering@p3 four kinds of bread — [i.e.,] loaves and wafers and cakes saturated in oil, three kinds of matzoh. It is [further] written [concerning these]: “along with loaves of leavened bread,” etc. And each kind [consisted of] ten loaves — @rr°@bbso it is set forth in Menochos. The amount [required consists of] five Jerusalemite @ITse’in@it, which are [equivalent] to six “desert” ones, [making] @rr°@bbtwenty @ITesronos@it. @d1Saturated,@p3 dough @rr°@bbscalded in boiling water as much as needed.<QC>
@p113@p2<EN>He shall bring his offering along with the sacrifice.@p3 This tells [us] @rr°@bbthat the bread is not holy as such that it itself is sacred to become invalid by [being] taken out [of the Temple courts] [or by being touched by] a @hh<HEB>טְבוּל יוֹם@ee<ENG>, nor to be removed [from its sanctified status] becoming common food through monetary redemption, until the sacrifice is slaughtered. @p114@p2<EN>One from each offering,@p3 @rr°@bbone [loaf of] bread of each type he should take as an offering (@hh<HEB>תְּרוּמָה@ee<ENG>) for the @ITkohein@it who does the service [for this sacrifice], and the rest is eaten by the owners. The flesh [of the sacrifice] belongs to the owners, except for the breast and thigh which are in it, as is set forth below [in regard to] the offering of the breast and thigh of the peace-offerings — and the thanksgiving offering is called a peace-offering. @p115@p2<EN>And the flesh of his thanksgiving peace-offering.@p3 There are many inclusions here: to include a sin-offering, a guilt-offering, the ram [the guilt-offering of] a nazirite, and @rr°@bbthe festal offering of the fourteenth [of Nisan] — [all of which] may be eated for a day and a night. @d1On the day of its sacrifice it may be eaten,@p3 and as the time limit of its flesh is @rr°@bbthe time limit of its bread. @d1He shall not leave over any of it until morning,@p3 but he may eat it all night. If so, why did they [=<TS>the Rabbis] say: @rr°@bbuntil midnight? In order to keep a person far from sin. @p116@p2<EN>If either a vow or a voluntary offering,@p3 which he did not bring as @rr°@bbthanksgiving for a miracle [as above], it does not require bread [to accompany the sacrifice], and it @rr°@bbmay be eaten for two days [and the night between], as is set forth in the section. @d1And on the next day the remnant of it @p3on the first [day] @d1may be eaten.@p3 This @ITvov@it is redundant [without an inclusion being intended], and there are many like it in Scripture, such as “and these are the sons of Tziv’on: and Ayoh and Anoh,” “and give and the Temple and the host to be trampled.”<QC>
@p118@p2<EN>And if it will be eaten, etc.@p3 [this refers to] @rr°@bbone who intends during the slaughtering to eat it on the third [day, which is forbidden] — [it is of this case] that the verse speaks. Perhaps if he ate of it on the third [day], [the sacrifice] @rr°@bbshould become invalid retroactively? The verse says: “it will not be favorably accepted from the one who brings it” — it becomes invalid [only] at the time of offering it, but it does not become invalid on the third [day]. And thus is its explanation: At the time of its offering @rr°@bbthis should not enter the mind [of the @ITkohein@it], @rr°@bband if he thought of it, “it will be an abomination.” @d1And anyone who eats of it@p3 — even @rr°@bbduring the time limit — shall bear its iniquity.<QC>
@p119@p2<EN>And the flesh@p3 of the sacred [animals] of the @rr°@bbpeace-offerings, @d1That shall touch any unclean [thing] may not be eaten. As to the flesh@p3 — to include @rr°@bba limb, part of which went out; that, the inner part is permitted [to be eaten]. @d1Every [ritually] pure person may eat [the] meat.@p3 What does the verse say? Since it is said, “and the blood of your sacrifices should be poured out [on the altar],” etc., “and the flesh you may eat,” perhaps [no one] but the owners may eat peace-offerings? @rr°@bbTherefore it is said: “Every [ritually] clean person shall eat [the] meat.” @d1([As for] the flesh, every [ritually] pure person may eat [the flesh],@p3 as though to say, everything which I forbade you in regard to the sin-offering and guilt-offering, that if they go outside the [Temple-court] partitions, they are forbidden, as is written, “in the courtyard of the Tent of Meeting shall they eat it” — regarding this [flesh] I say to you, “Every [ritually] clean person shall eat [the] meat,” even throughout the city [of Jerusalem])<QC>
@p120@p2<EN>And his uncleanness is on him.@p3 The verse speaks of @rr°@bbbodily uncleanness, but a [ritually] clean person who ate [ritually] unclean [sacrificial meat], is not punished with @hh<HEB>כָּרֵת@ee<ENG>, but rather with the warning of “and the flesh which shall touch anything unclean, etc.” [However,] the warning for a [ritually] @ITunclean@it person who ate [ritually] clean [sacrificial meat] is @rr°@bbnot explicitly [mentioned] in the Torah. Rather, the Sages @rr°@bbderived it by [means of] a @hh<HEB>גְזֵרָה שָׁוָה@ee<ENG>.<HEB> @rr<ENG>°@bbThree @hh<HEB>כְּרִיתוֹת@ee<ENG> are mentioned in regard to those who eat sacrificial meat while [ritually] unclean, and our Rabbis explained them in [Maseches] Shevu’os: One is [to teach] a general rule [regarding all sacrifices], one [teaches the rule regarding] a particular case, @rr°@bband one to teach regarding a sliding-scale sacrifice, which is recorded only [to prescribe atonement] for the uncleanness of the Temple and its holy [food]. @p124@p2<EN>@p3@d1May be used for any purpose.@p3 [This] comes to teach regarding [forbidden] @rr°@bbfat, [that it] does not acquire uncleanness [due to] @ITneveiloh@it. [and therefore cannot cause uncleanliness of @ITNeveiloh@it]<QC>
@d1But you are surely not permitted to eat it.@p3 Says the Torah: Let the prohibition of @hh<HEB>נְבֵלָה@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>טְרֵפָה@ee<ENG> come @rr°@bband fall on [=<TS>be added to] the prohibition of @hh<HEB>חֵלֶב@ee<ENG>, for if [a person] eats it he will be liable for the prohibition of @ITneveiloh@it also, and you should not say [that one] prohibition may not fall [=<TS>be added] onto another. @p126@p2<EN>Be it of fowl or beast,@p3 @rr°@bbexcluding the blood of fish and grasshoppers. @d1In all your dwelling places.@p3 Since this is an obligation of the individual, and is not an obligation [which pertains] to land [in the Land of Israel], @rr°@bbit applies in all [Jewish] habitations. And in Maseches Kiddushin, chapter 1, it is explained why it was necessary to state [this]. @p130@p2<EN>His hands shall bring it, etc.@p3 [To teach] that the owner’s hand[s should be] on top, and the fat and breast placed in it, [with] @rr°@bbthe @ITkohein@it’s hand beneath [them] and he waves them. @d1The fire-offerings of Adonoy,@p3 and what are the fire-offerings? @d1He shall bring it, the fat on the breast.@p3 When he brings it from the slaughter house, he places the fat on the breast, and when he places it into the hand of the @ITkohein@it who waves it, the breast turns out [to be] above and the fat below, and this is what is said in another place, “The thigh of the offering and the breast of the waving on the fire offerings of the fats shall they bring to wave,” etc. And after the waving he gives it to the @ITkohein@it who [is to] burn it [on the altar], and [so] the breast turns up below, and this is what is said, “And they place the fats on the breasts and he burns the fats on the altar.” [This] teaches us @rr°@bbthat three @ITkohanim@it are required for it, so it is explained in Menochos. @d1He shall bring it, the fat on the breast.@p3 Why does he bring the breast? He brings it to wave it, and not that it should become [part] of the fire offerings. @rr°@bbSince it is said: @d1The fire offerings of Adonoy, the fat on the breast,@p3 perhaps the breast too should be [part of] the fire offerings? Therefore it is said, the breast to wave, etc.<QC>
@p131@p2<EN>And the @BIkohein@BO shall burn the fat,@p3 and after that, @d1The breast shall belong to Aharon.@p3 It teaches us that the meat is not eaten while the fats are below the altar. @p132@p2<EN>Thigh,@p3 [the right rear leg] from the knee joint which is sold with the head until the middle joint, which is the calf of the leg. @p133@p2<EN>Whoever offers the blood of the peace-offerings, etc.@p3 He who is fit for sprinkling [the blood] and burning the fats — excluding one who is [ritually] unclean at the time of the sprinkling of the blood @rr°@bbor at the time of burning the fats, [and therefore one] who may not share in the meat. @p134@p2<EN>Wave, uplift.@p3 @rr°@bbHe moves them to and fro [horizontally, in all four directions], he raises and lowers.<QC>

@p123@p2<EN>Moshe and Aharon went [in]to, etc.@p3 Why did they enter? I found in the section of Millu’im, in the added @hh<HEB>בָּרַיְיתָא@ee<ENG> to our Toras Kohanim: Why did Moshe enter with Aharon? @rr°@bbTo teach him the ritual of the incense, or perhaps he entered for some other purpose? I can argue [as follows]: Descending and entering require a blessing, just as descending is similar to the [Temple] service, so entering is similar to the [Temple] service. Therefore you have learnt: Why did Moshe enter with Aharon? To teach him the ritual of the incense. Another interpretation: When Aharon saw that they offered all the sacrifices, and all the rituals had been performed, and [still] the @ITShechinoh@it did not descend for Israel, he was pained, and thought, “I know that God is angry with me and [it is] because of me that the Shechinoh did not descend for Israel”! He said to Moshe: “My brother Moshe, is this [what] you did to me, that I entered and was shamed”? Moshe immediately entered with him, and they begged for mercy, and the @ITShechinoh@it descended for Israel.<QC>
@d1They went outside and blessed the people.@p3 They said: “’May the pleasantness of Adonoy our God be upon us.’ @rr°@bbMay it be [His] Will that the @ITShechinoh@it should rest on the work of your hands.” Because all seven days of the installation [during which time] Moshe set up the Tabernacle and served in it [as a @ITkohein@it], and took it down every day — the @ITShechinoh@it did not rest on it, and Israel were ashamed, saying to Moshe: “Our master Moshe! All the trouble we went to [in order] that the @ITShechinoh@it should rest among us, and that we should know that we have achieved atonement for the sin of the [Golden] Calf. Therefore he said to them: “This is what Adonoy commanded you to do and the glory of Adonoy will appear to you. My brother Aharon is worthy and [even] more important that I, for by means of his sacrifices and his service the @ITShechinoh@it will rest among you, and you will know that the Omnipresent chose him.<QC>
@p124@p2<EN>They raised [their voices],@p3 according to its Targum. @p12@p2<EN>A fire came forth.@p3 Rabbi Eliezer says: The sons of Aharon died @rr°@bbonly because they rendered halachic decisions in the presence of their master Moshe. Rabbi Yishmo’el says: @rr°@bbIntoxicated with wine they entered the Sanctuary. You should know [that this is true], for after their death He warned the survivors not to enter the Sanctuary [while] intoxicated with wine. [This] may be compared to a king who had a [faithful] member of his household, etc. as it is [explained] in Vayikro Rabbo.<QC>
@p13@p2<EN>It is [as Adonoy spoke], etc.@p3 Where did He speak? “It is there that I will meet with Bnei Yisrael, and it [the Tabernacle] will be sanctified with My Glory.” Do not read: “with My Glory” (@hh<HEB>בִכְבוֹדִי@ee<ENG>), but [rather] “with My honored ones” (@hh<HEB>בִּמְכוּבָּדַי@ee<ENG>). Moshe Said to Aharon: “My brother Aharon, I had known that the Temple would be sanctified with those singled out as special by the Omnipresent, and I thought [this must mean] either through me or through you; now I see that @rr°@bbthey are greater than I or you.”<QC>
@d1and Aharon was silent.@p3 @rr°@bbHe received a reward for his silence; what reward did he receive? The Divine Word was specially [directed] to him, for @rr°@bbto him alone was said the @ITparoshoh@it regarding those intoxicated by wine. @d1Through those that are near Me,@p3 My chosen ones. @d1And in the presence of the entire people I will be glorified.@p3 When the Holy One, blessed is He, passes judgement on the righteous, He is feared and @rr°@bbexalted and praised. [People say:] “If so with these, how much more so with the wicked”! And so too it states: “You are awesome, O God, from Your Sanctuaries”! Do not read “from Your Sanctuaries” (@hh<HEB>מִמִּקְדָּשֶׁיךָ@ee<ENG>), but [rather] “from Your sanctified ones” (@hh<HEB>מִמְּקוּדָּשֶׁיךָ@ee<ENG>).<QC>
@p14@p2<EN>Aharon’s uncle.@p3 @rr°@bbUzziel was the brother of Amram, as it is said, “And the sons of Kehos, etc.” @d1Carry your brothers, etc.@p3 As a man who says to another, “Take away the dead [body] from before the bride @rr°@bbso as not to disturb the celebration.”<QC>
@p15@p2<EN>In their tunics,@p3 @rr°@bbof the dead men. This teaches that their clothes were not burnt, but [only] their souls; something like two threads of fire entered into their nostrils. @p16@p2<EN>Do not let [your hair] grow long.@p3 @rr°@bbDo not let [your] hair grow; @rr°@bbfrom here [we learn] that a mourner is forbidden [to take] a haircut, but [as for] @ITyou@it, do not disturb the Omnipresent’s celebration.<QC>
@d1So that you will not die.@p3 @rr°@bbTherefore, if you do so, you will die. @d1Your brothers, the entire House of Yisroel.@p3 From here [we learn] that the troubles of Torah Scholars @rr°@bbmust be mourned by all.<QC>
@p19@p2<EN>Wine or any other intoxicant.@p3 Wine @rr°@bbin a manner which intoxicates. @d1When you enter the Tent of Meeting.@p3 I [know] only when you enter the Temple [proper], when you approach the [outer] altar — from whence [do I know this]? “Entering the Tent of Meeting” is said here, and it is said regarding the sanctification of the hands and feet [before] entering the Tent of Meeting. Just as there [Scripture] made approaching the [outer] altar equivalent to entering the Tent of Meeting, so here it made approaching the altar equivalent to entering the Tent of Meeting.<QC>
@p110@p2<EN>To distinguish,@p3 in order that you should distinguish @rr°@bbbetween a proper service and [one which is] improper. Thus you learn that if he performed [the Temple] service his service is invalid.<QC>
@p111@p2<EN>And to teach.@p3 This teaches that one who is intoxicated is forbidden to issue [halachic decisions]. @rr°@bbPerhaps [such a person] is worthy of death? The verse says: “you and your sons with you.<TIE>.<TIE>. and you will not die.” @IT@rr°@bbKohanim@it in their [improper] service [are worthy of] death, but the Sages in their halachic decisions are not [worthy of] death.<QC>
@p112@p2<EN>The surviving, @p3from death. This teaches that death had been decreed on them too @rr°@bbfor the sin of [Aharon’s making] the [Golden] Calf, as it is said, “And God was exceedingly angry with Aharon to destroy him,” and “destroying” refers only to the death of children, as it is said, “And I will destroy his fruit above.” But Moshe’s prayer cancelled half [the decree], as it is said, @rr°@bb“And I also prayed on behalf of Aharon at that time. @d1Take the meal-offering.@p3 Even though you are @hh<HEB>אוֹנֵן@ee<ENG> @rr°@bband holy things are forbidden to an @hh<HEB>אוֹנֵן@ee<ENG>. @d1The meal-offering.@p3 This is the @rr°@bbmeal-offering of the eighth [day of the installation] and the meal-offering of Nachshon.<QC>
@d1And eat it [as] @BImatzos.@p3 @rr°@bbWhat does this verse teach [us]? Because it is a communal meal-offering and a meal-offering [prescribed only] for [that] time, and there is no similar one for [future] generations, it was necessary to set forth the rule of other meal-offerings. @p113@p2<EN>The portion of your sons,@p3 daughters have no portion in holy things.<QC>
@d1For so have I been commanded.@p3 That they should eat it while they are @hh<HEB>אוֹנְנִים@ee<ENG>. @p114@p2<EN>The breast of the wave-offering@p3 @rr°@bbof the communal peace-offerings, @d1You shall eat in a pure (undefiled) place.@p3 Did they then eat the first ones in an impure place? Rather, the first ones, which are most holy things, had to be eaten in a holy place, but these did not have to be eaten “within the hangings,” though they had to be eaten @rr°@bbwithin the camp of Israel, which was pure and thus @hh<HEB>מְצוֹרָעִים@ee<ENG> were forbidden to enter there. From here [we learn] that offerings of lesser sanctity (@hh<HEB>קָדְשֵׁי קָדָשִׁים@ee<ENG>) may be eaten within the entire city [of Jerusalem]. @d1You and your sons and daughters.@p3 You and your sons [are entitled] to a portion, but your daughters are not [entitled] to a portion. However, if you give them gifts, they are permitted to eat of the breast and shoulder. Or [perhaps] even the daughters [are entitled] to a portion? The verse says: “For [as] your portion and the portion of your sons it is given” — there is a portion for the sons but there is no portion for the daughters. @p115@p2<EN>On top of the fats of the fire offering.@p3 From here [we learn] that the fats are below at the time of waving, and [we thus learn] the reconciliation of the verses that they not contradict each other — I have already explained the three of them in [the Sidra of] @hh<HEB>צַו אֶת אַהֲרן@ee<ENG>. @p116@p2<EN>The goat of the sin-offering.@p3 The goat of the @rr°@bbadditional sacrifices for Rosh Chodesh. They offered three goats [as] sin-offerings on that day, the he-goat [of the installation], the goat [offered by] Nachshon, and the goat [offered as a sin-offering] on Rosh Chodesh, and of all of them, only this one was burnt. The Sages of Israel are in disagreement about this; some say it is was burnt because of impurity which touched it, and some say it was because of the state of @hh<HEB>אֲנִינוּת@ee<ENG>, because it is of the holy offerings ordained for all generations, but regarding holy offerings for the time [of installation] they relied on Moshe, who told them regarding the meal-offering: “Eat it [as] matzoh.” @d1Made a detailed inquiry.@p3 Two inquiries: @rr°@bbWhy was this one burnt? And why were these eaten? That is the version in Toras Kohanim.<QC>
@d1With Elozor and Isomor,@p3 out of respect for Aharon’s honor @rr°@bbhe turned his face toward the sons to show his anger. @d1Saying.@p3 He said to them: @rr°@bbAnswer my questions! @p117@p2<EN>Why did you not eat the sin-offering in a sacred place?@p3 @rr°@bbDid they then eat it outside the Holy [Place]? Did they not burn it? What [then did he mean by] saying: “in a sacred place”? Rather, he said to them: “Perhaps it went out “beyond the curtains” and became invalid”? @d1For it is holy of holies,@p3 and becomes invalid by being taken [outside]. They said to him, “No.” He [then] said to them: “Since it was in a sacred place, why did you not eat it”? @d1And He gave it to you, to bear [the iniquity of the congregation].@p3 For the @ITkohanim@it eat [the sacrificial meat] and the owners find atonement [thereby]. @d1To bear the iniquity of the congregation.@p3 From here we learn that it was a goat for [the musaf of] Rosh Chodesh, which atones for the sin of [causing] impurity [to] the Tabernacle and its sacred things. [This is the only possibility,] since the sin-offering of the eighth [day] and the sin-offering [brought by] Nachshon @rr°@bbdid not come for [the purpose of] atonement. @p118@p2<EN>Behold, its blood was not brought, etc.@p3 For if it had been brought, @rr°@bbyou would have had to burn it, as it is said, “And all sin-offerings whose blood is brought,” etc.<QC>
@d1You should certainly have eaten of it.@p3 @rr°@bbYou should have eaten it, even though you are @hh<HEB>אוֹנְנִים@ee<ENG>. @d1As I have commanded@p3 you @rr°@bbregarding the meal-offering. @p119@p2<EN>Aharon spoke.@p3 @rr°@bbThe term “speaking” is an expression of harshness, as it is said, “The people spoke [against Moshe].” Could it be that Moshe was angered at Elozor and Isomor and Aharon spoke? Thus you know that this was only by way of respect. They thought: It is not proper that our father should sit [silent] [while] we speak in his presence, and it is not proper that a disciple respond to his teacher. Perhaps [they were silent] because Elozor did not have [the ability] to respond? The verse says: “Elozor the @ITkohein@it said to the soldiers,” etc. Behold, when he wished [to], he spoke in the presence of Moshe and in the presence of the princes [of the tribes]. This I found in the Sifrei of Another Character.<QC>
@d1Behold, today they brought.@p3 What did he [mean] to say? @rr°@bbRather, Moshe said to him: “Perhaps you sprinkled its blood as @hh<HEB>אוֹנְנִים@ee<ENG>, and an @hh<HEB>אוֹנֵן@ee<ENG> who performs the service profanes it”? Aharon said to him: “And did they, who are ordinary people, bring [it]? I brought [it], for I am a @ITKohein Godol@it, and may bring [a sacrifice while being] an @hh<HEB>אוֹנֵן@ee<ENG>.” @d1And then such [tragedy] befell me.@p3 Even if the dead were not my sons, but other relatives for whom I am obligated to be an @hh<HEB>אוֹנֵן@ee<ENG> as [I am] for these, as for example, all [those] listed in the @ITparoshoh@it of @ITkohanim@it, for whose sake a @ITkohein@it must [allow himself] to become [ritually] unclean. @d1[If] I had eaten the sin-offering.@p3 @rr°@bbAnd if I had eaten, Would that have been good [in the eyes of Adonoy]? @d1Today,@p3 but the @hh<HEB>אֲנִינוּת@ee<ENG> of nighttime is @rr°@bbpermitted, for [the laws applying to] an @hh<HEB>אוֹנֵן@ee<ENG> [relate] only to the day of the burial. @d1Would that have been good in the eyes of Adonoy?@p3 If you heard [this law] regarding holy offerings of a specific time, you should not have taken a lenient view regarding holy offerings that are obligatory on all future generation @p120@p2<EN>It was good in his eyes.@p3 @rr°@bbHe admitted [the justice of Aharon’s argument], and was not ashamed to say: “I had not heard [this].”<QC>
@p11@p2<EN>To Moshe and to Aharon.@p3 He told Moshe @rr°@bbto tell Aharon.@d1@p3 @d1Saying to them.@p3 He [=<TS>Moshe] said that he [=<TS>Aharon] should say to Elozor and to Isomor. Or is it that [he was] to tell Israel? When [the verse] says: “Speak to Bnei Yisroel,” that is the Divine Commandment to Israel; How then do I interpret [the phrase] “to say to them”? To the sons [of Aharon], Elozor and Isomor. @p12@p2<EN>Speak to Bnei Yisroel.@p3 He equated all of them to be messengers for this Divine Commandment, because all of them were alike in their silence, and accepted God’s decree with love. @d1These are the living things.@p3 @rr°@bbAn expression of “life.” Because Israel is bound to God and worthy of being alive, therefore He separated them from [ritual] uncleanness and decreed @ITmitzvos@it upon them, but did not forbid anything to the nations. [This is] a parable of a physician who came in to visit a sick person, as is set out in the Midrash of Rabbi Tanchuma. @d1These are the living things.@p3 This teaches that Moshe would @rr°@bbhold the animal [concerned] and show it to Israel: This you may eat and this you may not eat! “This you may eat,” etc. — He also held each species of swarming water creatures and showed them — and so too of fowl: And these you shall consider repulsive from the fowl. And so regarding swarming things: And these shall be unclean to you. @d1These are the living things.<TIE>.<TIE>.all the animals.@p3 @rr°@bbThis teaches that animals are within the category of “living things.” @p13@p2<EN>All that have cloven hooves.@p3 According to its Targum: @rr°@bb“split.” @d1hoof.@p3 @ITPlante@it in Old French. @d1Completely split.@p3 Which is separated above and below into two nails, according to its Targum: “which has nails” [plural]. For there are [animals] whose hooves are split above but not entirely cloven and separated, for they are joined below. @d1Which chews its cud.@p3 Brings up and vomits the food from its intestines and returns it to its mouth to crush and grind it finely. @d1Its cud.@p3 Such is its name; it is possible that it is from the root “and like water drawn along,” for it is drawn towards the mouth. Its Targum is @hh<HEB>פִּשְׁרָא@ee<ENG> (“dissolved food”), for through the cud the food is dissolved (@hh<HEB>נִפְשָׁר@ee<ENG>) and liquified. @d1Among animals.@p3 [This is] an [apparently] @rr°@bbextraneous word for deriving [a new rule, namely], to permit [as food] the embryo found within the mother’s womb. @d1You may eat it,@p3 and not a [ritually] unclean animal. [But] has it not [been included] in the prohibition? Rather, [that one who eats forbidden flesh] transgresses [both] @rr°@bba positive and a negative commandment.<QC>
@p18@p2<EN>You shall not eat of their flesh.@p3 I know only these, [but what of] other [ritually] unclean animals which have no sign of purity [=<TS>permissibility], how do I know [this law applies]? You may say: It is a @rr°@bb@hh<HEB>קַל וָחוֹמֶר@ee<ENG>: If these [animals] which have some signs of purity are forbidden, etc. @d1Of their flesh.@p3 There is a prohibition for [eating] their flesh, [but] not on their bones, sinews, horns and claws.<QC>
@d1You may not touch their carcass.@p3 Perhaps Israelites are forbidden [to] touch carcasses? The verse says: “Say to the @ITkohanim@it,” — @ITkohanim@it are forbidden, [but] Israelites are not forbidden. [It is] thus a @hh<HEB>קַל וָחוֹמֶר@ee<ENG>. If the [ritual] impurity of a corpse, which is severe, is forbidden only to @ITkohanim@it, the impurity of a carcass, which is less severe, how much more so [does it not affect Israelites]. [Why then] does the verse say: “You shall not touch”? @rr°@bbOn a [pilgrimage] festival. @p19@p2<EN>Fins.@p3 [The limbs] with which it swims. @d1Scales.@p3 These are the scales attached to it (as it is said, “And he was dressed in scaled armor.”) @p110@p2<EN>Creeping things.@p3 Wherever [this expression is found] it denotes a low creature which creeps and moves along the ground.<QC>
@p111@p2<EN>They shall be repulsive to you.@p3 [This phrase comes] @rr°@bbto forbid their mixtures if they have in them [enough to] impart [their] taste. @d1Of their flesh.@p3 One is not prohibited from [eating] their fins and scales. @d1And their carcasses shall be repulsive to you,@p3 to include @rr°@bbgnats [found in liquids] which one has filtered. @hh<HEB>יַבְחוּשִׁין@ee<ENG> are @ITmoucherons@it in Old French. @p112@p2<EN>Anything which does not have, etc.@p3 @rr°@bbWhat does this verse tell [us]? @rr°@bbI might know only the permitted status of those which bring its signs [of purity] onto dry land, [but what if] it lost them in the water, how [do I know that they are permitted]? The verse says: “Anything which does not have fins or scales in the water,” thus if it had [them] in the water @rr°@bbalthough it lost them in being brought up [to dry land], it is permitted. @p113@p2<EN>They may not be eaten.@p3 To cause one who feeds them to a minor to be liable, for such is its meaning: they may not be eaten through your action. Or perhaps [this extraneous phrase comes] only to prohibit [one to receive] any benefit from them? The verse says: “You may not eat” — they are prohibited @rr°@bbto be eaten, but [receiving] benefit [from them] is permitted. Any fowl of which it is said: “to its kind,” “to its kind,” “to its kind,” has among its species some which do not resemble each other either in appearance or name, [but] @rr°@bball of them are of one species. @p116@p2<EN>The sparrow hawk.@p3 @ITEspervier@it in Old French. @p117@p2<EN>The cormorant.@p3 Our Rabbis explained: This is [the bird] which draws up fish out of the sea. And that is what Onkelos translated [in Targum]: “and @hh<HEB>שָׁלֵי נוּנָא@ee<ENG>,” “and fish drawer.” @d1The little owl and the eagle owl.@p3 Those are the @ITchouettes@it which scream at night, and they have cheek bones like humans, and another which is similar is called a @IThibou@it. @p118@p2<EN>The horned owl.@p3 That is the @ITchauvesouris@it; it resembles a rat, and flies about at night. The @hh<HEB>תִּנְשֶׁמֶת@ee<ENG> mentioned among the creeping things, resembles it, [but] has no eyes, and is called a @ITtalpa@it. @p119@p2<EN>The stork.@p3 This is the white @hh<HEB>דַיָּה@ee<ENG>, @ITcigogne@it, and why is it called “@hh<HEB>חֲסִידָה@ee<ENG>“? Because it does kindnesses with its fellows in regard to food. @d1The heron.@p3 That is the “angry @hh<HEB>דַיָּה@ee<ENG>,” and it seems to me that this is what is called a @ITheron@it. @d1The hoopoe.@p3 The wild cock, which has a double comb, in Old French @ITherupe@it. Why is it called a @hh<HEB>דּוּכִיפַת@ee<ENG>? Because its ornament [=<TS>its comb] is tied together, and this is its comb. Onkelos translated [it as] @hh<HEB>נַגָּר טוּרָא@ee<ENG>, [“mountain splitter”], so called because of its actions, as our Rabbis explained in Maseches Gittin, in the chapter of Mi She’achozo. @p120@p2<EN>Winged insects.@p3 These are thin, lowly creatures which creep on the ground, like flies, hornets, gnats and locusts. @p121@p2<EN>on four,@p3 [that is,] on four legs.<QC>
@d1above their legs,@p3 close to its neck it has two leg-like [appendages], aside from its four [true] legs, and when it wishes to fly and leap from the earth, it strengthens itself by these two [appendages] and flies. There are many [of these], such as those called @ITlongouste@it, but we are not familiar with them, for [though] four signs of purity [=<TS>permissibility] are said regarding them — four legs, four wings, and @ITkarsulayin@it, [which are] the “knees“ mentioned here, and its wings cover most of it[s body], all these signs are found in those which are among us, but there are those whose head is long and have no tail, and whose name must be @hh<HEB>חָגָב@ee<ENG> (“locust”), and regarding this we are not knowledgable in distinguishing among them. @p123@p2<EN>All flying insects, etc.@p3 [This] comes and teaches [us] that if @rr°@bbit has five [feet], it is [ritually] clean.<QC>
@p124@p2<EN>And as for these — @p3that are about to be listed in the section below. @d1You can be made unclean.@p3 That is to say, @rr°@bbthere is uncleanness [which comes] with their touch. @p125@p2<EN>Anyone who carries of their carcasses, etc.@p3 Wherever @rr°@bbthe uncleanness [caused by] carrying is mentioned, it is more severe than [that caused by] touch, for [the former] requires the washing of clothing.<QC>
@p126@p2<EN>Thus every animal which has cloven hooves but its hooves are not [completely] split.@p3 As for example, a camel, whose hoof is split above, but joined below. [This] teaches you that the carcass of an [ritually] unclean animal causes uncleanness, and in the section @rr°@bbat the end of the @ITparshah@it it explains [the rule] regarding a [ritually] clean animal.<QC>
@p127@p2<EN>On their paws,@p3 such as a dog, @rr°@bbbear and cat. @d1They are unclean to you — @p3in regard to touch. @p129@p2<EN>These are unclean to you.@p3 All these impurities are not in regard to the prohibition of eating, but to [ritual] uncleanness itself, to be [made] unclean by their touch, [and the one who touches them] is forbidden to eat @hh<HEB>תְּרוּמָה@ee<ENG> and holy things, and to enter the Sanctuary. @d1Weasel,@p3 @ITmoustille@it [in Old French]. @d1Toad,@p3 @ITbot@it, which resembles a frog. @p130@p2<EN>Hedgehog,@p3 @ITherisson@it. @d1Lizard,@p3 @ITlizard@it. @d1Slug,@p3 @ITlimace@it. @d1Mole,@p3 @ITtalpa@it. @p132@p2<EN>It must be put into water,@p3 and even @rr°@bbafter its immersion it is unclean for @hh<HEB>תְּרוּמָה@ee<ENG> — @d1until the evening@p3, and after that — @d1 it becomes clean@p3 with the setting of the sun.<QC>
@p133@p2<EN>Into which.@p3 No earthenware vessel becomes unclean @rr°@bbexcept through its interior. @d1Everything that is within it becomes unclean.@p3 The vessel @rr°@bbin turn causes impurity to whatever is in its interior. @d1And you shall break it.@p3 [This] teaches that [earthenware vessels] @rr°@bbcannot be purified in a @ITmikveh@it.<QC>
@p134@p2<EN>Of all the foods which are eaten.@p3 This refers @rr°@bbto the verse above: “All that is within it becomes unclean.” “Of all the foods which may be eaten” — upon which water comes while it is within an unclean earthenware vessel, becomes unclean. (and so too “every beverage which is drunk in every vessel” —  and it is within an unclean earthenware vessel, becomes unclean.) We learn many things from here: We learn that food is not ready and prepared to acquire uncleanness until water comes on it [at least] once, and once water comes on at [at least] once, it acquires uncleanness forever, @rr°@bbeven when dry. [We also learn] that wine and oil, and everything called “a liquid” prepares seeds for uncleanness, just [as] water [does], for so can the verse be expounded: “Upon which water comes” or “every beverage which is drunk in any vessel, impure shall be” — the food. Furthermore, our Rabbis learned from here that a secondary uncleanness cannot cause vessels to be unclean, and thus we learned: Perhaps all vessels can become unclean from the interior of an earthenware vessel? The verse says: “All that is within it becomes unclean” “of all food” — @rr°@bbfood (or liquid) become unclean from the interior of an earthenware vessel, [but] all vessels do not become unclean from the interior of an earthenware vessel. [This is] because a creeping thing (@hh<HEB>שֶׁרֶץ@ee<ENG>) is a Father of Uncleanness and a vessel which becomes unclean from it becomes a Child of Uncleanness and therefore it does not in turn cause uncleanness to @ITvessels@it which are within it. We learnt further that a creeping thing (@hh<HEB>שֶׁרֶץ@ee<ENG>) which fell into the interior of an oven while the loaf was within it [but] the creeping thing did not touch the loaf, the oven is a First and the loaf is a Second, and we do not say that we see the oven as though it it is full of uncleanness, and [so] the loaf will be a First, for if you say so, no vessels are excluded from becoming unclean from the interior of an earthenware vessel, for the uncleanness itself touched them on their outside. And we learned further in regard to water coming [on vegetation] that it does not prepare seeds [to acquire uncleanness] unless it fell on [the vegetation] @rr°@bbafter it had been picked, for if you say that they acquire fitness [to acquire uncleanness] while still attached [to the ground], you have no [foodstuff] which has not had water come on it, and why then does [the verse] say: “upon which water comes”? [It means] after it had been picked. And we learned further that foodstuffs do not cause other [foodstufffs] to become unclean @rr°@bbunless [the former] are [at least] an egg’s-volume [in amount], as it is said, “which are eaten” — food which is eaten at one [gulp], and the Sages estimated that the gullet cannot hold more than a hen’s egg [at once]. @p135@p2<EN>An oven and a hearth.@p3 These are vessels @rr°@bbwhich may be moved, they are of earthenware and have an interior. One leans the pot over the opening of the hollow space, and both of them have their openings above. @d1Shall be shattered.@p3 For earthenware vessels cannot be purified by immersion. @d1They shall be unclean to you.@p3 That you should not say: I am obligated to shatter them: the verse says: “They shall be unclean to you” — [but] if he wishes to retain them in their unclean state, he is permitted [to do so]. @p136@p2<EN>A well-spring and a pit@p3 @rr°@bbattached to the ground, do not acquire uncleanness. [Moreover,] you have still to learn: @d1shall be pure — @p3one who immerses in them [shall be pure] of their uncleanness.<QC>
@d1That which touches their carcasses shall be unclean.@p3 Even if he is within the @rr°@bbwell-spring or pit while touching their uncleanness, he will be unclean. @rr°@bbFor you should not propose a @hh<HEB>קַל וָחמֶר@ee<ENG>: If [immersion] purifies the impure from their uncleanness, all the more will it save the pure from becoming unclean; therefore it is said: “that which touches their carcasses shall be unclean.” @p137@p2<EN>Any sowing seed.@p3 Seed of any seed-plant. @hh<HEB>זֵרוּעַ@ee<ENG> is a noun, as [in the verse]: “And they shall give us of the seeds.” @d1It remains clean.@p3 The verse teaches you that [foodstuffs] are not prepared and fit @rr°@bbto be called “food” to acquire uncleanness until water comes on them. @p138@p2<EN>And if water was once placed on seeds,@p3 after it was uprooted, for if you say that there is a [state of] fitness in regard to [plants] still rooted [in the soil], there is no seed which has not been prepared [for uncleanness]. @d1Water on seed,@p3 whether water @rr°@bbor other liquids, or whether it fell on the seed, @rr°@bbwhether the seed falls into them, all this is expounded in Toras Kohanim. @d1And part of their carcasses fell on them — @p3even after they became dried of moisture, for the Torah was particular only that it should be called “food,” And once there descended on it a [state of] preparedness for acquiring uncleanness it no longer departs from it. @p139@p2<EN>Its carcass — @p3[but] @rr°@bbnot bones and sinews, and not horns or hooves, and not hide. @p140@p2<EN>Whoever carries its carcass.@p3 @rr°@bbThe uncleanness [caused by] carrying is more severe than the uncleanness [caused by] touch, for one who carries it causes uncleanness [to] clothes, [but] as for one who touches [it], his clothes are not unclean, for it is not said about the latter, “he shall wash his clothes.” @d1Whoever eats of its carcass.@p3 @rr°@bbPerhaps the eating of it will make him unclean? When it says regarding the carcass of clean bird, “An animal which has died on its own and an animal that was fatally maimed he must not eat to defile himself with it” it — causes uncleanness to clothes while it is eaten, but the carcass of an animal does not cause uncleanness to clothes while it is eaten, if there is no carrying involved. as for example if another person stuck it into his gullet. If so, why does [the verse specify] “whoever @ITeats@it“? To give a measure for one who carries or touches [it] —  [that is], @rr°@bbas much a[s the minimum amount] for eating — and that is an olive’s-bulk. @d1And [he] is unclean until the evening.@p3 Even though he has immersed he [still] requires @rr°@bbthe setting of the sun [to complete his purification]. @p141@p2<EN>That crawls on the ground.@p3 [This comes] to exclude the gnats in peas and beans and the mites in lentils, for [these] do not creep on the earth but within the food, but when they emerge into the air and swarm, they become forbidden. @d1It may not be eaten.@p3 [This comes] to make liable one who feeds [others] as one who [himself] eats. [The word] @hh<HEB>שֶׁרֶץ@ee<ENG> denotes only a [creature] which is low, with @rr°@bbshort feet, and which appears as [something] creeping and crawling. @p142@p2<EN>Whatever crawls on its belly.@p3 This is the snake, and the expression “belly” [denotes] bending low, in that it moves bent down and fallen on its belly. @d1Whatever crawls.@p3 To include @rr°@bbworms @rr°@bband whatever is similar to anything similar to it. @d1Whatever goes on four [legs].@p3 This is the scorpion. @d1Whatever.@p3 To include the beetle, @ITescarbot@it in Old French, and whatever is similar to anything similar to it. @d1Whatever has many feet.@p3 This is the centipede, a creeping thing which has feet from its head to its tail on either side [of its body], and it is called a @ITcentpies@it.<QC>
@p143@p2<EN>Do not make yourselves repulsive@p3 by eating them, since “your souls” is written, and there is no repulsion of the soul by touch.

@d1And you shall become holy before Me,@p3 for I will sanctify you Above and in the World to Come. @d1And you shall not make yourselves unclean.@p3 [All these phrases are intended] to make [one eating these creatures] transgress @rr°@bbmany negative commandments, and every negative commandment [involves] a whipping, and this is what is said in the Talmud: [If] he ate a @ITputiso,@it he receives four [sets of whippings], [if he ate] an ant, he receives five, a hornet, he receives six. @p145@p2<EN>For I am Adonoy who brings you up.@p3 In order that you shall accept My commandments I brought you up. Another interpretation: “For I am Adonoy Who brought you up” — in all [the verses which speak of the Exodus] it is written: “I brought you out,” while here it is written “I brought you up.” The school of R. Yishmo’el taught: If I had only brought Israel up from Egypt only that they refrain from becoming unclean with creeping things as [do] the other nations — it would have been sufficient. And this is their advantage over others — this [explains] the expression of “bringing up.”<QC>

Rather, [this refers] to a skin-eruption which [appeared] in one of the twenty-four tips of limbs which do not become unclean because of [the sign of] healthy flesh — because the skin eruption cannot be seen all at once, since [the limbs] slope on either side. The tip of the limb [subsequently] changed and the sloping side became exposed through fat, as for example it became healthy and broadened, [so that] @rr°@bbhealthy [flesh] could be seen — the verse teaches us that it becomes unclean. @d1On the day.@p3 What does the verse teach us: “And on the day”? To teach us that there is a day on which you examine it, and there is a day on which you do not examine it. @rr°@bbFrom here they [the Sages] said: A bridegroom is given all seven days of festivity, for him, his robe, @rr°@bbhis garments, and his house, and so too @rr°@bbduring a festival, he is given all the days of the festival. @p115@p2<EN>It is @BItzora’as@BO — @p3that flesh. @hh<HEB>בָּשָׂר@ee<ENG>, [flesh], is masculine. @p118@p2<EN>An inflammation.@p3 An expression of being heated, for the flesh has become inflamed with an injury which came to him @rr°@bbbecause of a wound, [and] not by fire.@d1 That has healed.@p3 [That is,] @rr°@bbthe inflammation has healed, and in its place another skin eruption has appeared. @p119@p2<EN>Or a snow-white spot tinged with red.@p3 That [is], the skin eruption is not plain white, but variegated and @rr°@bbintermingled with two colors —  white and red. @p120@p2<EN>Its appearance is lower [than the skin].@p3 Not that its substance is lower, but because of its whiteness it appears low and deep, as the appearance [of anything illuminated by] the sun [seems] deeper than shadow.<QC>

When the burnt part healed, it became a variegated snow-white spot or plain white. The signs of a burnt spot and the signs of an inflammation are the same; why [then] did the Torah separate them? To tell you that they cannot be combined one with the other. [If] inflammation [the size of] half a half-bean develops, and half a half-bean of burnt spot, they may not be judged as a [whole] half-bean.<QC>
@p129@p2<EN>On the head or in the beard.@p3 The verse comes to distinguish between a skin-eruption in a hairy part [of the body] and a skin-eruption on a fleshy [part of the body]; for the sign of [impurity] of one is a white hair, and the sign of [impurity] of the other is a golden hair.<QC>
@p130@p2<EN>There is a golden hair in it.@p3 [That is,] @rr°@bbthe black hair in it turned golden. @d1It is a @BInesek,@p3 @rr°@bbsuch is the name of a skin eruption in a hairy part [of the body]. @p131@p2<EN>And there is no black hair in it.@p3 Thus, @rr°@bbif there was a black hair in it, he is [ritually] clean and there is no need for confinement, for the black hair is a sign of purity in regard to @ITnesokim@it, as it is said, “And a black hair grew in it, [the @ITnesek@it is healed, he is clean].”<QC>
@p132@p2<EN>And behold, it did not spread, etc.@p3 Thus, if it spread @rr°@bbor there was in it a golden hair, it is unclean. @p133@p2<EN>He shall be shaved@p3 around the @ITnesek@it. @d1but he shall not shave the @BInesek.@p3 He leaves two hairs next to it all around, in order that its spread should be recognizable, for if it spreads, it will pass the hairs and enter the shaven [part of the skin]. @p135@p2<EN>After he is pronounced clean.@p3 [I know] only if it spreads after [his] release [that he is unclean], from where [do I know that this applies] even at the end of the first week or the end of the second week?

The verse says: “@ITand@it hair.” The expression @ITtzohov@it [refers to anything] resembling the appearance of gold. @rr°@bb@ITTzohov@it [is] like @ITzohov@it, @ITorpale@it in Old French.<QC>

The verse says: “skin eruption. As the appearance of @ITtzora’as@it of the skin of the flesh.” Like the appearance of the @ITtzora’as@it which is mentioned in the @ITparashoh@it of “the skin of the flesh” — “When a person will have, in the skin of his flesh,” and what is said there? That he becomes unclean with four [types of] appearances, and is judged with [confinement of a maximum] of two weeks. It is not like the appearance of @ITtzora’as@it mentioned in [regard] to inflammations and burnt parts, where he is judged with [confinement] of one week. It is also not like the appearance of @ITnesokin@it in the hairy parts [of the head], which do not cause uncleaness by four [types of] appearance: a spot of intense whiteness and its second, a snow-white spot and its second. @p144@p2<EN>His skin eruption is on his head.@p3 I [know the following laws] only of @ITnesokin@it; from where [do I know] to include @rr°@bbother afflicted persons? The verse says: “He must surely declare him unclean” — to include all of them. Regarding all of them it says: “His clothes shall have a tear in them, [his hair shall grow long, etc.”]<QC>
@p145@p2<EN>Have a tear in them,@p3 torn. @d1Be grown long.@p3 Hair grown long. @d1And he must cover his head down to his upper lips,@p3 like a mourner. @d1Upper lip,@p3 the hair of the lips, @ITgrenon@it in Old French. @d1And “Unclean, unclean” shall he call out.@p3 He must announce that he is unclean @rr°@bb[so that people] will keep away from him.<QC>

@p151@p2<EN>A prickly @BItzora’as.@p3 As in the expression, “a @rr°@bbprickly brier,” @ITpoignant@it in Old French. And its midrashic intepretation: Give him a curse (@hh<HEB>מְאֵרָה@ee<ENG>) that he may not benefit therefrom. @p152@p2<EN>Be it in wool or in linen.@p3 Of wool or of linen — this is its plain meaning. And its midrashic interpretation: Perhaps he should bring fleeces @rr°@bbof wool or stalks of flax and burn them with it? The verse says: “@ITIt@it shall be burned in fire” — it does not need anything else with it. If so, why does the verse say: “be it in wool or in linen”? @rr°@bbTo exclude [from burning] the borders in it made from another material. The word @hh<HEB>אוּמְרִיּוֹת@ee<ENG> is an expression of “edge,” like @hh<HEB>אִימְרָא@ee<ENG>, “border.”<QC>
@p154@p2<EN>The article having the eruption.@p3 Perhaps [washing is required] of @rr°@bbthe place of the eruption alone? @rr°@bbThe verse says: “the @ITarticle@it having the eruption” — perhaps [then] the entire garment requires washing? @rr°@bbThe verse says: “the eruption.” How is this possible? He should wash some of the garment along with it. @p155@p2<EN>After it was washed,@p3 a passive construction. @d1The eruption did not change its hue.@p3 @rr°@bbIt did not fade from its [original] color.<QC>
@d1And the eruption did not spread.@p3 We understand that if it did not turn [color] and did not spread, it is unclean — @rr°@bball the more so if it did not turn [color] but spread. [But if] it turned [color] but did not spread, I do not know @rr°@bbwhat should be done with it. [Therefore] the verse says: “He shall confine the eruption” — in any case, so the words of R. Yehudah. But the Sages say, etc., as it is in Toras Kohanim. I make mention of this here [in order] to explain th[is] verse properly. @d1It is a deep mark.@p3 An expression [denoting] a pit, as [in the verse] “in one of the pits,” that is to say, it is deep, an eruption whose appeared is sunken. @d1Be it in a worn garment or be it in a new garment.@p3 As its Targum, “in its worn state or in its new state.” @d1In a worn,@p3 worn, old. And [these expressions are used] for the midrashic interpretation which requires a @hh<HEB>גְזֵרָה שָׁוָה@ee<ENG>. How do we know that if [the eruption’s] spreading over [the entire garment] [is considered a sign] of cleanness for garments? @hh<HEB>קָרַחַת@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>גַבַּחַת@ee<ENG> is said in [regard] to a person, and @hh<HEB>קָרַחַת@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>גַבַּחַת@ee<ENG> is said in [regard] to a garments, just as in the former case [if] it spread throughout all of it it is clean, so here [if] it spread throughout all of it, it is clean. Therefore, the verse seized on the expression of @hh<HEB>קָרַחַת@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>גַבַּחַת@ee<ENG>. Regarding the matter of its Targum[ic interpretation] this is its [plain] meaning: @hh<HEB>קַרַחַת@ee<ENG> is an expression [denoting] “old” and @hh<HEB>גַבַּחַת@ee<ENG> is an expression [denoting] “new,” as though it were written “at its end or at its beginning.” Because @hh<HEB>קָּרַחַת@ee<ENG> is an expression [denoting] the back, and @hh<HEB>גַּבַּחַת@ee<ENG> is an expression [denoting] the front, as it is written: “and if on the front [of his head],” and the @hh<HEB>קָּרַחַת@ee<ENG> [refers to] anything which slopes down and descends from the skull and to the back. So it is explained in Toras Kohanim. @p156@p2<EN>He shall tear it.@p3 He shall tear the place of the eruption from the garment @rr°@bband burn it. @p157@p2<EN>It is a recurrent outbreak.@p3 Something which returns and erupts. @d1You shall burn it in fire — @p3the whole garment. @p158@p2<EN>The eruption disappears from them,@p3 if when they wash it at first, by order of the @ITkohein,@it the eruption disappears from it entirely. @d1It shall be washed a second time.@p3 An expression of immersion [in a @ITmikveh@it]; the Targum[ic expression] of “washing” in this section is an expression of whitening. “and it shall be whitened” — except for this [case], where it [refers] not to whitening but to immersion. Therefore its Targum is “and it shall be dipped.” So too all clothes washing — which [really refer to] immersion are translated [into Aramaic] as “and it shall be dipped.”<QC>

@p136@p2<EN>Before the @BIkohein@BO will come, etc.@p3 As long as the @ITkohein@it has not yet concerned himself with it, there is no law of uncleanness here. @d1So everthing in the house shall not become impure.@p3 For if [the owner] does not empty it, and the @ITkohein@it comes @rr°@bband sees the eruption, it is necessary to confine [the house] and everything within it will become unclean. @rr°@bbAnd with what was the Torah concerned [that it not become unclean]? If regarding vessels that are purified by immersion, let him immerse them and let them become pure; if regarding food and drink, let him eat them when he himself is unclean; thus, the Torah was concerned only @rr°@bbwith earthenware vessels, which cannot be purified in a @hh<HEB>מִקְוֶה@ee<ENG>. @p137@p2<EN>Impressions,@p3 @rr°@bbsunken in appearance.<QC>
@p140@p2<EN>And they shall remove the stones.@p3 According to its Targum: “they shall remove” — he shall carry them away, @rr°@bbas [in the expression], “and she shall remove his shoe,” an expression [denoting] removal. @d1To an impure place,@p3 a place in which pure things are not handled. The verse teaches you that these stones cause uncleanness to their place @rr°@bbwhile they are still there. @p141@p2<EN>He shall scrape.@p3 @ITRogner@it in Old French, and in Mishnaic Hebrew, it occurs many times. @d1The inside,@p3 @rr°@bbfrom within. @d1All around,@p3 @rr°@bbaround the eruption. In Toras Kohanim this is midrashically interpreted in this way; that he should scrape the plaster which is around the stones [which have] the eruption. @d1They scraped.@p3 An expression of “borders,” @rr°@bbwherein they scraped [around] the borders of the eruption all around.<QC>
@p143@p2<EN>Was scraped.@p3 [This grammatical form] is @rr°@bban expression of something having been done, and so [too] @hh<HEB>הִטּוֹחַ@ee<ENG> “having been plastered,” but [the phrase] @hh<HEB>חִלֵּץ אֶת הָאֲבָנִים@ee<ENG>, [“he removed the stones,”] refers to the man who removed them, and [the verb] is in the @rr°@bbintense conjugation, as @ITkippeir@it, [“he atoned”], @ITdibbeir@it, [“he spoke”]. @d1And if the eruption returns, etc.@p3 Perhaps [if] it returns on that same day it should become unclean? The verse says, “the @ITkohein@it shall return,” “and if it returns” — just as “returning” mentioned below [refers to a time] at the end of a week [of confinement], so “returning” mentioned here [refers to a time] at the end of a week [of confinement]. @p144@p2<EN>The @BIkohein@BO shall come and see, and behold, the eruption has spread in the house.@p3 Perhaps [an eruption] which returns is not unclean unless it spreads? @hh<HEB>צָרַעַת מַמְאֶרֶת@ee<ENG> [“a prickly @ITtzora’as@it“] is said regarding houses, and @hh<HEB>צָרַעַת מַמְאֶרֶת@ee<ENG> is said regarding garments, just as below [the verse] declared impure [an eruption] which returns even though it did not spread, so here it declared unclean an [eruption] which returns, even though it did not spread. If so, why does the verse say, “and behold, it spread”? This is not the place of this verse, but “and he shall dismantle the house” should have been written after @rr°@bb“and if the eruption returns.” “And [the @ITkohein@it shall come] and see,” and behold the eruption has spread” therefore comes to teach only regarding an eruption which remains unchanged in his sight during the first week, and he comes at the end of the second week @rr°@bband finds that it spread. For previously the Torah did not explain anything regarding if the eruption remained [unchanged] in his sight during the first week — and it teaches you here in regard to this spreading, that it speaks only regarding [an eruption] which remained unchanged during the first and spread during the second. What should he do with it? Perhaps he dismantles it, as [laid down by the verse] adjacent to it: “and he shall dismantle the house”? The verse says: “and the @ITkohein@it shall return,” “and the @ITkohein@it shall come.” We learn “coming” from “returning,” just as [in] “returning” he removes [the affected stones] and scrapes and plasters and gives it another week, so [in regard to] “coming” he removes [the affected stones] and scrapes and plasters and gives it another week — if it returns he dismantles; if it does not return, [the house] is [ritually] pure. And from where [do we know] that if it remained [unchanged] during this [week] and that [week], he removes [the affected stones] and scrapes and plasters @rr°@bband gives it a week? The verse says, (“he shall come”) “and if he shall come and see.” In [regard to] what is the verse speaking? @rr°@bbIf regarding [a case] where [the eruption] spread during the first [week], it was already mentioned. If regarding [a case] where [the eruption] spread during the second [week], it was already mentioned. @rr°@bbThus, (“he shall come”) “and if he shall come” must deal with [a case] in which [the @ITkohein@it] came at the end of the first week, and came at the end of the second week, and saw, and behold! It had not spread. What does he do in the case of this unchanged [eruption]? Perhaps he should just leave, as it is said here, “and he shall declare the house pure”? The verse says, “for the eruption has healed” — I have declared clean only that which is [totally] healed. What shall he do with it? “Coming” is mentioned above and “coming” is mentioned below; just as the one above he removes [the affected stones], scrapes, plasters and gives it another week — for he learns [a @hh<HEB>גְזֵרָה שָׁוָה@ee<ENG>]: “This is ’returning,’ this is ‘coming’” — so [too] regarding the [case] below, etc. as it is in Toras Kohanim. In conclusion, dismantling [is carried out] only with an eruption which returns after removal [of the affected stones], scraping and replastering, and the [eruption] which returns does not require “spreading.” The order of verses is as such: “And if it returns” “he shall dismantle,” “whoever will come inside the house,” “whoever will eat inside the house,” “the @ITkohein@it shall come and see, and behold! It has spread,” and the verse speaks of [an eruption] which remains [unchanged] during the first [week], that he gives it a second week of confinement, and at the end of the second week of its confinement, [the @ITkohein@it] comes and sees that it spread. What shall he do to it? He removes [the affected stones], scrapes, replasters and gives it a week. [If] it returns, he dismantles [the house]; [if] it does not return, it requires [purification with] birds, for, [cases of] eruptions [do not last] longer than three weeks. @p146@p2<EN>All the days of its confinement.@p3 @rr°@bb[But] not the days in which he scraped its eruption. Perhaps I exclude the [house which has been] @rr°@bbdeclared [unclean] which has had its eruption scraped? The verse says: “any of the days.” @d1Shall be impure until the evening.@p3 [This] teaches @rr°@bbthat it does not cause impurity to clothes. Perhaps [this refers to a case where] he waited [even as short at space of time] @rr°@bbas that in which one might eat half a loaf? The verse says: “Whoever will eat inside the house shall wash his garments.” I [know this] only of one who eats, from where [do I know this of] one who lies down? The verse says: “Whoever will lie down.” I [know] only this of one who eats and lies down, one who does not eat or lie down — from where do we know [that he is unclean]? The verse says, “he must wash.<TIE>.<TIE>.he must wash” — [this] includes [such a case]. If so, why are “one who eats” and “one who lies down” stated? So as to give the measure [of time for impurity to occur] for one who lies down — [the space of time] in which one might eat half a loaf.<QC>@p148@p2<EN>And if shall come@p3 at the end of the second week. @d1And see, and behold! The eruption did not spread.@p3 This verse comes to teach [us the rule regarding a case] in which [the eruption] is [unchanged] in his sight during the first [week] and during the second [week]; what shall he do to it? Perhaps he should declare it clean, as the plain sense of the verse [indicates]: “and the @ITkohein@it should declare the house pure”? The verse says: “for the eruption has healed” — I have declared clean only that which is [totally] healed, And considered healed is only when a house has been scraped and plastered and [in which] the eruption did not return. But this [house] requires removal of the [affected stones], scraping, replastering, and a third week. And so is the verse interpreted midrashically: “And if he comes during the second [week] and sees, behold! It did not spread” — he must plaster it, and there can be no plastering without removal [of stones] and scraping — “and after plastering the house, the @ITkohein@it declares the house clean” — if [the eruption] does not recur at the end of the [third] week. Since the eruption has healed, [but] if it returns, [the verse] has already explained [that] a returning [eruption] requires [the house] be dismantled.

@p12@p2<EN>Should [discharge] flow.@p3 @rr°@bbPerhaps [a discharge] flowing from anywhere should be impure? The verse says, “from @IThis@it flesh” — and not all his flesh. After the verse distinguished between flesh and flesh, I may argue: @rr°@bb[The Torah] declared a male with a discharge unclean and a female with a discharge unclean; just as a female with a discharge [has a flow] from a place from which she becomes unclean with a less severe impurity — @hh<HEB>נִדָּה@ee<ENG>, [from that same place] she becomes unclean with a severe impurity — @hh<HEB>זִיבָה@ee<ENG> — so [too] regarding a male with a discharge: from the place from which he becomes unclean @rr°@bbwith a less severe impurity — @hh<HEB>קֶרִי@ee<ENG>, he becomes unclean with a severe impurity — @hh<HEB>זִיבָה@ee<ENG>. @d1His discharge, he is impure.@p3 [This] teaches in regard to @rr°@bba drop [of discharge] that it causes impurity. [This] discharge resembles water of dough made of barley, @rr°@bband dissolved, and similar @rr°@bbto the white of an egg which is crushed; semen is thick, like the white of an egg that is not crushed.<QC>
@p13@p2<EN>[His flesh] drips.@p3 An expression [denoting] spittle — which drips from his flesh. @d1[With] his discharge,@p3 like spittle, it issues [in a] clear [form]. @d1Or@p3 @d1[his flesh] be stopped up,@p3 because [the discharge] issues [in a] thick [form], and closes up the opening of the membrum, and his flesh is closed up by the drop of his discharge — this is its plain meaning. And its midrashic interpretation: The first verse counts two sightings and calls him unclean, as it is said: “discharge [@ITzovo@it] flows [@ITzov@it] from the flesh — he is unclean;” and the second verse three sightings and called him unclean as it is said “his uncleanness is in his discharge [@hh<HEB>בְּזוֹבוֹ@ee<ENG>], his flesh drips [with] his discharge [@hh<HEB>זוֹבוֹ@ee<ENG>], or his flesh is clogged with his discharge [@hh<HEB>מִזּוֹבוֹ@ee<ENG>]; it is his uncleanness.” How is this possible? Two [sightings] for uncleanness, @rr°@bband the third requires him [to bring] a sacrifice. @p14@p2<EN>Every bed [=<TS>anything that is used specifically for sleeping],@p3 that which is fit for laying down on. Perhaps [this applies] even to [something used] specifically for another activity? @rr°@bbThe verse says: “upon which he lies” —  “which he lay [down on]” is not said, but upon “which he [customarily] lies” — something specifically [and] always [employed] for this. [This] excludes [an object] of which [workmen] say: @rr°@bb“Get up so that we can do our work!” @d1[On] which he sits.@p3 “[On which] he sat” is not said, but “on which he [customarily] sits,” something specifically [and] always [employed] for this. @p15@p2<EN>A person who touches his bed.@p3 [This] teaches [that] [sitting on] a bed [causes] a more severe [uncleanness] than [that transmitted] by touch, for this becomes a primary source, to cause uncleanness to people [who in turn] cause uncleanness to the clothes [they are wearing]. But touching which [does not involve] a bed is only @rr°@bba secondary source of uncleanness, and only causes uncleanness to food and drink.<QC>
@p16@p2<EN>Whoever sits on a vessel,@p3 even if he did not touch [it], @rr°@bbeven if ten vessels [lie] one on another, all cause impurity by means of “sitting,” @rr°@bband so [too] in regard to a bed.<QC>
@p18@p2<EN>If the @BIzov@BO spits on a ritually clean person,@p3 and [the spittle] touches him or he carries it, [he becomes unclean], @rr°@bbbecause spittle causes uncleanness by means of carrying. @p19@p2<EN>Anything that is used for riding,@p3 @rr°@bbeven if he had not sat on it [when riding], for example the hold on the saddle which is called @ITarcon@it, becomes impure by means of “riding.” [Likewise,] the saddle, which is called @ITalves@it is unclean as being something to sit upon. @p110@p2<EN>Anyone who touches anything which is beneath him,@p3 @rr°@bb[beneath] the @ITzov@it. [This] comes to teach [us] regarding a saddle that one who touches it is unclean, [but] does not require washing clothes, and this is a severity of a bed over a saddle.<QC>
@d1Whoever carries them — @p3[who carries] anything mentioned in regard to the matter of a @ITzov@it, his discharge, his spit, his semen, his urine, his “sitting” and his “riding” — carrying them causes uncleanness to people, [who in turn] cause uncleanness to clothes [they are wearing]. @p111@p2<EN>And his hands were not rinsed in water.@p3 As long @rr°@bbas he did not immerse [to cleanse himself] from his uncleanness, and even if his discharge ceased and he counted seven [clean days] and he is [still] lacking immersion — he causes uncleanness in all his [ways] of uncleanness. And the reason the verse expressed [the idea] of the immersion of the body of the @ITzov@it with the phrase “washing of the hands” — is to teach you that [a person’s] @rr°@bbhidden parts do not need to have water touch them, but [only] the exposed parts of the person’s body, such as the hands. @p112@p2<EN>And an earthenware vessel that [the @BIzov@BO] will touch.@p3 Perhaps [it is unclean] even if he touches it from the outside, etc. as it is stated in Toras Kohanim until [the words]: “what [type] of touch is as though [he touched] all of it? Say: @rr°@bbthis is [when one] causes it to move.” @p113@p2<EN>And when he (a @BIzov@BO) becomes ritually clean — @p3@rr°@bbwhen he stops [seeing a discharge]. @d1Seven days for his purification.@p3 Seven days clean of the uncleanness of @ITzivoh@it, @rr°@bbthat he not see a discharge, and all of them consecutive.<QC>
@p118@p2<EN>They shall bathe in water.@p3 This is a royal decree that a woman should become unclean as a result of marital relations. The reason [for her uncleanness] is not because of the touch of semen, for it is considered @rr°@bbcontact with one’s inner parts [and is not considered a touch which transmits impurity].<QC>
@p119@p2<EN>When a woman has a discharge.@p3 Perhaps [this refers to a discharge] from one of her organs? The verse says: “And she exposed the source of her blood,” [which implies] that only [that] blood causes uncleanness which comes from the womb. @d1The discharge will be blood in her body.@p3 Her discharge is called a “discharge” to cause impurity only when it is red. @d1In her menstrual impurity.@p3 As [the verse] “and they shall drive him out of the world.” [This implies] that she is driven out of contact with everyone. @d1She shall be in her menstrual impurity.@p3 Even if she @rr°@bbonly saw one sighting.<QC>
@p123@p2<EN>If he is on the bed.@p3 One who lies or sits on her bed or on her seat, @rr°@bbeven if he did not touch her, he too, is under the rule of the uncleanness mentioned in the verse above, which requires the washing of clothes. @d1On the vessel — @p3to include a saddle. @d1When he touches it.@p3 This speaks only of a saddle, which was included [midrashically] from [by the phrase] “on the vessel.” @d1When he touches it, he is unclean.@p3 But is not required to wash his clothes, for touching a saddle does not cause a person to make his clothes unclean.<QC>
@p124@p2<EN>Her menstrual impurity shall be on him.@p3 @rr°@bbPerhaps he will join her in her state — that [is,] if he has marital relations with her on the fifth day of her menstrual impurity he will only be unclean for [the remaining] three days, as she is? The verse says: “He will be unclean seven days.” Why does the verse say: “Her menstrual impurity will be on him”? Just as she causes impurity to people and earthenware vessels, so [too] he will cause impurity to people and earthenware vessels. @p125@p2<EN>Many days,@p3 @rr°@bbthree days.<QC>
@d1Outside her menstrual cycle.@p3 After the passing of the @rr°@bbseven days of her menstrual uncleanness. @d1Or if [the discharge] flows@p3 @rr°@bbthese three days,<QC>
@d1after her menstrual cycle — @p3one day @rr°@bbafter her menstrual cycle, she is a @ITzovoh@it, and her status is determined by this section, not by the regulation of menstruation, for this one is required to count seven clean days and [bring a] sacrifice — while a menstruant woman is not required to count clean days, but will remain in her menstrual impurity for seven days, whether she sees [a discharge] or whether she does not see [a discharge within that time]. The [Rabbis] expounded in this section [the rule that] there are eleven days between the end of the menstrual period and the beginning of the [next] menstrual period, which if she sees [a discharge] @rr°@bbfor three consecutive days during these eleven days she will become a @ITzovoh@it.<QC>
@p131@p2<EN>You shall separate.@p3 [The word] @hh<HEB>נְזִירָה@ee<ENG> [means] @rr°@bbseparation, and so [too the words as used in the verse] “they have separated themselves, [moving] backwards [away from God]. So [too] “the one separate from his brothers.” @d1And they will not die because of their impurity.@p3 Thus the “being cut off” (@hh<HEB>כָּרֵת@ee<ENG>) of @rr°@bbone who causes impurity to the sanctuary is called “death.”<QC>

@p16@p2<EN>The sin-offering bullock which is his.@p3 That is what is mentioned above, and [this] teaches you here that it comes [=<TS>is purchased] from his [property], @rr°@bband not from public [funds]. @d1And atone on his own behalf and on behalf of his household.@p3 @rr°@bbHe confesses over it, his sins, and the sins of his household. @p18@p2<EN>Aharon shall put lots on the two he-goats.@p3 He places @rr°@bbone [goat] to his right and one to his left, and places his two hands into the urn [which holds the lots], and takes a lot in the right and its companion in the left; and he places these upon them — [the one] on which is written “to God” is for the Name [=<TS>God (@ITla-Shem@it)], and [the one] on which is written “to Azazel” is sent to Azazel.<QC>
@d1Azazel@p3 is a mountain, strong and hard, @rr°@bba high cliff, as it is said “a land cut off,” cut off. @p19@p2<EN>And do (offer) it as a sin-offering.@p3 When he places the lot on it, he calls it a name, saying “for Adonoy @rr°@bba sin-offering.” @p110@p2<EN>Shall be placed alive,@p3 [The form @ITyo’omad@it, “it shall be placed”] is like [the form] @ITyu’amad@it — by others, and its Targum is, “it shall be made to stand when [it is still] alive.” @rr°@bbWhy does the verse say this? Because it is said, “to send it to Azazel,” and I do not know whether its sending is to [its] death or for life, therefore it is said, “it shall be placed alive” — it stands alive, until it is sent away; from there [I learn] that it is sent for death. @d1To achieve atonement with it,@p3 @rr°@bbthat he shall confess over it, etc. as it is written, “and he shall confess over it.”<QC>

They said: This entire section is written in order, except for this entrance, which is after the offering of his burnt-offering and the burnt-offering of the people, the burning of the entrails of the bullock and he-goat, which were done in [the @ITKohein Godol@it’s] golden garments, [after which] he immerses and sanctifies, takes them off and puts on [his] white garments. @d1Aharon will [then] come into the Tent of Meeting —@p3 in order to take out the spoon and incense-pan with which he had offered incense within the Holy of Holies. @d1And remove the linen garments.@p3 After taking them out, he dons golden garments for [offering] the perpetual [burnt-offering] of the afternoon. And this is the order of the [Temple] Services: The morning perpetual offering in golden garments; the Service of the bullock and he-goat within, and the incense of the fire-pan in white garments; his ram and the people’s ram and part of the additional sacrifices in golden garments; the taking out of the spoon and fire-pan in white garments, and the rest of the additional sacrifices, the perpetual [burnt-]offering of the afternoon, and the incense offered in the Sanctuary proper upon the inner altar in golden garments. The order of the verses according to the Services is as such: “[The man] shall send the goat into the desert,” “he shall wash his body in water,” etc., “and go out and do his burnt-offering,” etc. “the fat of the sin-offering,” etc. and [then] the whole section until “and afterwards he shall come into the encampment,” and after that: “Aharon will [then] come.”<QC>
@d1And place them there.@p3 [This] teaches that they require being @rr°@bbhidden away; he will not use those four [linen] garments for another Yom Kippur. @p124@p2<EN>He shall wash his flesh, etc.@p3 Above we learned from “and he shall wash his body and don them,” that when he changes from golden garments to white garments he is required to immerse, (for in that immersion he had taken off the golden garments with which he had performed the Service of the daily morning [burnt-offering], and put on white garments for the Service of the Day) @rr°@bband here we have learned that when he changes from white garments to golden garments he is required to immerse. @d1In a sacred place,@p3 sanctified with the sanctity of the [Outer] Court, and it was @rr°@bbin the roof of the Parva House, and so [too] the four immersions which are obligatory for the Day, but the first [immersion] was @rr°@bbin common [space]. @d1And don his garments,@p3 eight garments @rr°@bbin which he performs the Service all the [other] days of the year. @d1He shall go out@p3 of the Sanctuary [proper] to the Court in which the Burnt-Offering Altar was located. @d1And do (offer) his burnt-offering,@p3 the ram for the burnt-offering mentioned above. @d1And the people’s burnt-offering,@p3 @rr°@bband one ram for the burnt-offering mentioned above, “and from the congregation of Bnei Yisroel,” etc.<QC>
@p125@p2<EN>The fat of the sin-offering,@p3 the entrails of @rr°@bbthe bullock and goat. @d1He shall burn on the altar,@p3 on the outer altar, for if the inner [were intended, is it not] written: “Do not bring upon it strange incense; neither burnt-offerings nor meal-offerings.” @p127@p2<EN>Whose blood was brought@p3 to the Sanctuary @rr°@bband within [=<TS>to the Holy of Holies].<QC>

The verse says: @rr°@bb“and who will be initiated, etc.” And these are all of the @ITkohanim gedolim@it who arose after Yoshiyohu onward, for in his days the flask of anointing oil was hidden. @d1To serve in his father’s stead.@p3 This teaches us that if his son is capable of fulfilling his father’s place, @rr°@bbhe has precedence over everyone else.<QC>
@p134@p2<EN>He did as [Adonoy] commanded [Moshe] Etc.@p3 @rr°@bbWhen Yom Kippur arrived, he performed [Service] according to this order — to recount Aharon’s praise, that he did not wear [these garments] @rr°@bbfor his own greatness, [but] rather to fulfill the Royal decree. @p13@p2<EN>Who will slaughter an ox [or] lamb.@p3 @rr°@bbThis verse speaks of consecrated [animals], as it is said, “so that it may be brought as an offering.”<QC>

@p115@p2<EN>That will eat an improperly slaughtered animal@p3 @d1or an animal with a fatal defect.@p3 The verse speaks of @rr°@bbthe carcass of a pure [=<TS>kosher] bird, which has no [rule of ritual] impurity except @rr°@bbwhen it is swallowed in the gullet. And [the verse] teaches you here that it causes uncleanness by its being eaten but does not cause uncleanness by touch. [The word] @hh<HEB>טְרֵפָה@ee<ENG> mentioned here has been written only for midrashic exposition, and so we have learnt: Perhaps the carcass of a impure [=<TS>unkosher] bird causes uncleanness in the gullet? The verse says: @hh<HEB>טְרֵפָה@ee<ENG> @rr°@bbwhatever has within its category [the possibility of being] improperly slaughtered, excluding an impure [=<TS>unkosher] bird, which does not have within its category [the possiblity of being] improperly slaughtered. @p116@p2<EN>He bears his iniquity,@p3 @rr°@bbif he eats holy food or enters the Sanctuary, he is liable for this impurity as for other impurities. @d1And does not bathe his flesh.<TIE>.<TIE>. he bears his iniquity.@p3 He is punished with @ITkoreis@it for not washing his body, @rr°@bband for not washing his clothes [he is punished] with lashes.<QC>

Rather, this verse refers to their customs, matters which are [social] obligations for them, such as [attending] @rr°@bbtheaters and stadiums. Rabbi Meir says: These are the “ways of the Amorites” which the Sages enumerated. @p14@p2<EN>You shall fulfill My laws,@p3 these are matters mentioned @rr°@bbin the Torah as law, which if they were not mentioned, would have been proper to mention. @d1And keep My statutes,@p3 matters which are a royal decree, against which the evil inclination raises objections: Why should we keep them? And the nations of the world raise objections against them; such as [the law against] eating of pork, the wearing of @ITshaatnez,@it and the purification [power] of @hh<HEB>מֵי חַטָּאת@ee<ENG>. Therefore, it is said: @d1I am Adonoy,@p3 My decree is upon you, @rr°@bbyou may not evade [them]. @d1To follow them.@p3 You may not evade them, that you not think: “I have learned the wisdom of Israel, I will go and learn the wisdom of the nations.” @p15@p2<EN>You shall keep My statutes, etc.@p3 [This comes] to include @rr°@bbother subdivisions [of these laws] which the Torah has not detailed. Another interpretation: it provides for @rr°@bbkeeping and fulfilling the statutes and keeping and fulfilling the laws, for [until now the Torah] only provided “fulfilling” for laws, and “keeping” for statutes. @d1He shall live through them,@p3 in the World to Come, for if you say [that this refers] to this world, will he not in the end die [even if he keeps the @ITmitzvos@it]? @d1I am Adonoy,@p3 faithful to give a reward [to those deserving of it]. @p16@p2<EN>You shall not approach,@p3 [the word @hh<HEB>תִּקְרְבוּ@ee<ENG>] provides a warning for a female as [well as] a male, and therefore it is expressed @rr°@bbin plural form.<QC>

@p12@p2<EN>Speak to the entire congregation [of] Bnei Yisroel.@p3 [This] teaches that this @ITparashoh@it was said @rr°@bbduring an assembly, since most essentials of the Torah are dependent on it. @d1You shall be holy.@p3 Separate yourselves @rr°@bbfrom sexual crimes, and from transgression, for wherever you find a fence against sexual crime, you find holiness [mentioned]: “A harlot or a profaned woman [they shall not marry].<TIE>.<TIE>. for I, Adonoy, am Holy, [the One] Who makes you holy,” “He shall not profane his offspring [among his people], for I am Adonoy, [the One] Who makes him holy,” “They shall be holy .<TIE>.<TIE>. a harlot or a profaned woman [they shall not marry].” @p13@p2<EN>A man — you shall fear his mother and father.@p3 @rr°@bbEach one of you shall fear his father and mother, this is the plain meaning.

For it is in a man’s power to do, @rr°@bbbut a woman is under the control of others. @d1You shall fear his mother and father.@p3 Here [God] placed the mother before the father, because it is known to Him that a son fears his father more than his mother, [while] in regard to honor He placed the father before the mother, since it is known to Him that a son honors his mother more than his father, because @rr°@bbshe wins him over with words. @d1And keep My Sabbaths.@p3 Keeping the Sabbath is placed adjacent to the fear of [your] father [in order] to tell [you]: Even though I warned you regarding the fear of [one’s] father, if he should say to you: “Violate the Sabbath,” you must not listen to him — and so in regard to all the other @ITmitzvos@it. @d1I am Adonoy your God.@p3 You and your father @rr°@bbare obligated [to] @rr°@bbhonor Me, therefore you must not listen to him [when he tells you] to violate My words.

The verse says: “And anyone who eats from it shall bear the burden of iniquity” “from it” — and not from a related [prohibition]; [this] excludes [a sacrifice] slaughtered @rr°@bbwith the intention [of eating it] outside its [proper] place. @d1An abomination.@p3 Abominable, as in [the verse]: “And broth of abominable things is in their vessels.”<QC>
@p18@p2<EN>Whoever eats from it shall bear his iniquity.@p3 @rr°@bbThe verse speaks of absolute @hh<HEB>נוֹתָר@ee<ENG>, and he is not punished with @hh<HEB>כָּרֵת@ee<ENG> for [a sacrifice] which has been slaughtered outside its [proper] place, for the verse already excluded it; this [therefore] speaks of absolute @hh<HEB>נוֹתָר@ee<ENG>, and in Maseches Kerisos [our Rabbis] derived it from a @hh<HEB>גְזֵרָה שָׁוָה@ee<ENG>. @p19@p2<EN>You shall not completely reap a corner of your field,@p3 that one should leave @rr°@bba corner at the end of his field. @d1Gleanings of your harvest,@p3 sheaves @rr°@bbwhich fall down during harvesting. One or two [of them constitute gleanings], but @rr°@bbthree are not [considered] “gleanings.” @p110@p2<EN>You shall not glean,@p3 @rr°@bbyou must not take [the] gleanings that are in it, and they are recognizable. What are “gleanings”? Whatever [clusters] have @rr°@bbno “shoulders” or “drippings.”<QC>
@d1Fallen grapes of your vineyard,@p3 @rr°@bb[the single] berries of the grapes which fall [to the ground] during the [grape-]gathering. @d1I am Adonoy, your God,@p3 @rr°@bba Judge Who punishes [wrongdoers], and [for this sin] I exact from you, @rr°@bbnothing less than [your] souls as it is said: “Do not rob the poor, etc., for God will plead their cause, etc.” @p111@p2<EN>You shall not steal.@p3 @rr°@bb[This is] a prohibition against one who steals money, but [the prohibition] of “you shall not steal” in the Ten Commandments is a prohibition against one who kidnaps people. This matter is deduced from its context — a matter for which he is liable to a court-exacted death penalty [as are the preceding Commandments]. @d1You shall not deny [a rightful claim].@p3 Because it is said, “and denies it” [and] he pays the principal plus a fifth, we have learned [the] punishment, from where [do we derive] the prohibition? The verse says: “You must not deny [a rightful claim].” @d1And each one of you shall not lie.@p3 Since it is said, “and swears falsely,” “he shall pay its price and an additional fifth,” we have learned [the] punishment, from where [do we derive] the prohibition? The verse says: “And you shall not lie.” @d1You shall not steal and you shall not deny and each one of you shall not lie to each other and you shall not swear [falsely].@p3 @rr°@bbIf you steal, in the end you will deny, in the end you will lie, in the end you will swear falsely. @p112@p2<EN>You shall not swear [falsely] by My Name.@p3 Why is this said? Since it was said: “Do not take the Name of Adonoy, your God, in vain,” perhaps he will be liable only for [swearing] with the Unique Name, from where do we include all the Attributes? The verse says: “You shall not swear falsely by My Name — [by] whatever Name I have. @p113@p2<EN>You shall not withhold wages@p3 @rr°@bbThis [refers to one] who withholds the wages of a hired hand.<QC>
@d1Shall not remain overnight.@p3 @rr°@bb[This verb] is feminine, referring to [the word] @hh<HEB>פְּעוּלָּה@ee<ENG> [“wages, accomplishment”]. @d1Until morning.@p3 @rr°@bbThe verse speaks of a day-laborer, who leaves [work] when the sun sets. Therefore, the time of collecting his wages is all night. And in another place it states: “and the sun shall not set on him.” [This verse] speaks of a night-laborer, the end of [whose] work [time] is at dawn, [and] therefore the time of collecting his wages is all day. Because the Torah gave the owner — @rr°@bba half-day period — to obtain the necessary cash. @p114@p2<EN>You shall not curse a deaf person.@p3 I [know this of] a deaf person, from where [do I know to] include everyone? @rr°@bbThe verse says: “Do not curse among your people.” If so, why is “a deaf person” mentioned? Just as a deaf person is special in that he is alive, so too anyone who is alive —  @rr°@bbexcluding the dead, who are not alive. @d1And before a blind person you shall not place a stumbling block.@p3 Before someone blind in the matter [at hand] you shall not give @rr°@bbadvice which is unsuitable for him; do not say: “Sell your field and buy a donkey,” @rr°@bb[while] you maneuver against him and take it from him. @d1You shall fear your God,@p3 since this matter is not given over to people [to decide], to know if [the] intention of this one was for good or evil, and he can evade [the charge of evil intent] by saying: “My intent was for the best,” therefore it is said about it: “you shall fear your God” — the One Who discerns your thoughts. Similarly every matter which is given over to the heart of the person who does it, [while] other people cannot discern [his real intent], it is said: “you shall fear your God.” @p115@p2<EN>You shall not commit injustice in judgement.@p3 [This] teaches that the judge who corrupts a case is called an unjust person, hateful and detestable, [doomed to] destruction and an abomination. For the unjust person is called an abomination, as it is said: “for abomination to God.<TIE>.<TIE>.is anyone who does injustice.” @rr°@bbAnd an abomination is called accursed and detestable, as it is said: “and you shall not bring an abomination into your house [to] become doomed to destruction like it; you shall consider it detestable,” etc. @d1You shall not favor a poor man,@p3 that you must not think, “This one is @rr°@bba poor man, and the rich man is required to support him; I will rule in his favor in [this] law suit, with the result that he be supported in a respectable way.” @d1You shall not show honor to a powerful man,@p3 that you must not think, “This one is rich, he is from a prominent family, how can I embarrass him and behold him in his humiliation? This [humilation] is worthy of punishment!” Therefore it says: “And you shall not show honor to a powerful man.” @d1With righteousness shall you judge your fellow,@p3 according to its plain meaning. @rr°@bbAnother interpretation: Judge your fellow @rr°@bbfavorably. @p116@p2<EN>Do not be a tale-bearer.@p3 I say that [that the word @hh<HEB>רָכִיל@ee<ENG> refers to tale-bearing] because all those who cause arguments and speak slander go to their friends’ houses to spy what evil they can see, or whatever evil they can hear, [in order] to tell it in the marketplace, [thus] they are called “those who go around tale-bearing” — those who go around spying, @ITespiement@it in Old French. [As] proof for my words, [is the fact] that we do not find [the term] @hh<HEB>רְכִילוּת@ee<ENG> written without an expression of “going”: “you shall not go @hh<HEB>רָכִיל@ee<ENG>,” “those who go @hh<HEB>רָכִיל@ee<ENG>, they are brass and iron,” while [regarding] other [cases] of slander it is not written [an expression of] “going.” [Thus,] “who in secret slanders his neighbor,” “a false tongue,” “a tongue that speaks arrogantly.” Therefore I say that the expression [@hh<HEB>הוֹלֵך רָכִיל@ee<ENG>] [means] “going about and spying,” @rr°@bbsince the @ITkof@it interchanges with the @ITgimmel@it, for all letters whose source is one place interchange one with the other: @ITbeis@it with @ITpeh@it, @ITgimmel@it with @ITkof@it and @ITkuf @it, @ITnun@it with @ITlammed@it, and @ITzayin@it with @ITtzaddi@it, and so “He spied against your servant,” [meaning:] “he spied me out shrewdly in order to speak evil against me,” and so [too] “that has no slander on his tongue.” Again, [the word] @hh<HEB>רוֹכֵל@ee<ENG>, “a peddler,” who travels and spies out merchandise, and so [too] one who sells spices [to women] with which to adorn themselves, because he constantly goes around villages —  is called a @hh<HEB>רוֹכֵל@ee<ENG>, denoting a @hh<HEB>רוֹגֵל@ee<ENG>, [“one who spies.”] And its Targum: @hh<HEB>לָא תֵיכוּל קוּרְצִין@ee<ENG>, as: @hh<HEB>וַאֲכַלוּ קַרְצֵיהוֹן, דִי יְהוּדָיֵא@ee<ENG> (“who slandered the Jews,” ) @hh<HEB>אֲכַל בֵּיה קוּרְצָא בֵּי מַלְכָּא@ee<ENG> (“he slandered him to the king,” ) It seems to me [in relation to this Aramaic expression] that their custom was to eat in the house of one who accepted their reports a little snack, and that [constituted] the final confirmation that his report was well-founded, and he considers them as true. That little snack is called @hh<HEB>אֲכִילַת קוֹרְצִין@ee<ENG> an expression of “he winks with his eyes,” for it is the way of all those who slander to wink with their eyes and to hint at their slanderous reports, that the other listeners should not understand. @d1You shall not stand idly by [when] the blood (life) of your fellow [is in danger].@p3 to behold his death [when] you are able to save him, as for example one drowning in a river, or if a wild beast or robber attack him. @d1I am Adonoy, etc.,@p3 @rr°@bbfaithful to reward and faithful @rr°@bbto exact payment.<QC>
@p117@p2<EN>You shall not bear a sin on his account,@p3 do not shame him in public. @p118@p2<EN>You shall not take revenge.@p3 He said to him: @rr°@bb“Lend me your scythe.” “No!” says [the other]. The next day [the second one] says [to the first]: “Lend me your axe.” [The latter] says: “I will not lend it to you, just as you did not lend it to me” — this is taking revenge. And what is “bearing a grudge”? He said to him: “Lend me your axe.” “No!” says [the other]. The next day [the second one] says [to the first]: “Lend me your scythe.” [The latter] says: “Here it is, I am not like you, that you did not lend me” — that is “bearing a grudge,” for he keeps the hatred in his heart, even though he does not take revenge. @d1You shall love your fellow[-Jew] as yourself.@p3 Said Rabbi Akiva: @rr°@bbThis is a great principle in the Torah. @p119@p2<EN>Keep My statutes —@p3 and these are: @d1Do not cross-breed your animals with different species, etc.@p3 These statutes are royal decrees without [a humanly understandable] reason for them. @d1A garment which contains @BIshaatnez@BO.@p3 Why is this said? Because it is said [in Devorim]: “You must not wear @hh<HEB>שַׁעַטְנֵז@ee<ENG>, wool and linen together.” Perhaps [this means] that he should not wear wool-shearings and flax-stalks? The verse says: “A garment.” From where [do I know the prohibition applies] to felt? The verse [in Devorim] says: “@hh<HEB>שַׁעַטְנֵז@ee<ENG>“ — something that is combed, woven and twisted together. And I say that @rr°@bb@ITnuz@it is an expression of something rubbed [between the fingers to make into threads] @rr°@bband woven together to be joined, @ITtistre@it in Old French, like “fit for the dried seeds (@ITnezoy@it) which are in them,” which we interpret as @rr°@bban expression of “withering,” @ITflestre@it in Old French. [The word] @hh<HEB>שַׁעַטְנֵז@ee<ENG> Menachem defines as a @rr°@bbcombination of wool and flax.<QC>
@p120@p2<EN>Designated for a [specific] man.@p3 Designated and singled out for a man; @rr°@bbI know of no similar term in @ITTanach.@it [It is] of a Canaanite maid-servant, @rr°@bbhalf maid-servant and half free woman, @rr°@bbwho is engaged to a Hebrew slave who is permitted [to remain with such] a maid-servant [that] the verse speaks. @d1And she has certainly not been redeemed.@p3 [She is] redeemed and not redeemed; generally, redemption is by money. @d1Or her freedom,@p3 @rr°@bbby deed [of manumission]. @d1There shall be an investigation.@p3 @rr°@bbShe suffers [lashes] and not he; it is obligatory for the Court to investigate the matter [in order] not to require her [to be put to] death, @d1for her freedom was not given to her,@p3 and her marriage is not a completely valid marriage. And our Rabbis learned from here that whoever [suffers the punishment of] lashes @rr°@bb[is subject] to a proclamation; the judges who have him whipped call out to the one lashed: “If you are not careful to fulfill [all the words of the Torah] etc. Adonoy will make your plagues noteworthy.” [And he explained: “There shall be a @hh<HEB>בִּקּרֶת@ee<ENG>“ — it shall be @hh<HEB>בִּקְרִיאָה@ee<ENG>, (“with calling out.)”] @d1For her freedom was not given to her.@p3 Therefore, @rr°@bbhe is not liable to the death penalty for her, for her marriage is not considered a [valid] marriage; @rr°@bbthus, if she was freed, her marriage is considered a marriage and he is liable to the death penalty.<QC>
@p122@p2<EN>And he will be forgiven for the sin which he committed.@p3 @rr°@bb[This] includes one who sinned intentionally as one who sinned unwittingly. @p123@p2<EN>You shall regard it[s fruit] as closed off.@p3 You shall close off its closing: it should be closed off and blocked off from having benefit therefrom. @d1[For] three years it shall be closed off to you.@p3 From when does he count it? From the time of its planting. Perhaps if he stored it [=<TS>the fruit], @rr°@bbit should be permitted after three years? @rr°@bbThe verse says: “it shall be” — it remains in its [original] state. @p124@p2<EN>All of its fruits shall be holy — @p3 like [the] second tithe regarding which it is written: “All tithings of the land, etc. [are] sacred to Adonoy.” Just as [the] second tithe is not eaten outside the walls of Jerusalem except when redeemed, so also this, and this matter is praise to Adonoy, @rr°@bbthat he carries it there to praise and glorify Heaven. @p125@p2<EN>So that it will increase its produce for you.@p3 This @ITmitzvoh@it that you should keep will be in order to increase its produce, for in reward [for the fulfillment of the @ITmitzvoh@it of @hh<HEB>עָרְלָה @ee<ENG>] I will bless the fruits of planting for you. Rabbi Akiva used to say: “The Torah pays regard to [a person’s] evil inclination, that a person should not say: ’Behold, I have troubled myself for four years for nothing’! Therefore, it is said: ’To increase its produce.’” @d1I am Adonoy,@p3 I am Adonoy who promises regarding this, and am faithful to fulfill My promise. @p126@p2<EN>You shall not eat on the blood.@p3 [This] is expounded in many ways in [Maseches] Sanhedrin: [It is] a prohibition against one who eats of holy flesh before the sprinkling of the blood, and a prohibition against one who eats [flesh] from a common animal, before its soul [life] leaves it, and many more.<QC>
@d1You shall not act on the basis of omens.@p3 Such as those who look to omens, [interpreting the cry of @rr°@bba] mole and [the twittering of] birds; his bread falls from his mouth, a deer crossed his path. @d1Nor act on the basis of auspicious times.@p3 An expression of “times and hours” —  that @rr°@bbhe says: “This day is good for beginning a job, this hour is bad for going out.” @p127@p2<EN>Do not round the corners of your heads.@p3 [This] refers to one @rr°@bbwho makes [the hair of] his temples [similar] to [the hairless state] of the back of his ear and to [the hairless state of] his forehead, so that the circumference of his head is circular all around, [since] on the back of his ears the roots of his hair are much higher than his temples.<QC>
@d1The edges of your beard.@p3 The tip of the beard and its “borders,” and they are five: two on each cheek, above, @rr°@bbnear the head, where [the cheek] is broad and has two corners, and one at the bottom, on the chin, the place at the joint of the two cheeks.<QC>
@p128@p2<EN>Gashes for the dead,@p3 @rr°@bbsuch is the custom of the Amorites, to cut [gashes] in their flesh when one [of the family] dies. @d1Tattoo marks,@p3 a writing engraved and sunk [into the flesh] [and] which [therefore] can never be erased, @rr°@bbbecause he tattoos it with a needle and it remains black forever. @d1Tattoo,@p3 an expression [similar to] “and hang them,” and “and we will hang them.” They stick a pole in the ground, and hang them on it; as a result, they were sunk in @rr°@bband stuck into the ground, @ITpourpoynt@it in Old French. @p129@p2<EN>You shall not defile your daughter by causing her to engage in harlotry.@p3 [This refers] to one who hands over his single daughter for sexual relations not for the purpose of marriage.<QC>
@d1Lest the land turn astray —@p3 if you do this, the earth will cause its fruits to go astray, to produce them in another place, and not in your land. And so it says: “[You have polluted your land with harlotry].<TIE>.<TIE>., and therefore the showers have been withheld.” @p130@p2<EN>You shall fear My Sanctuary.@p3 One may not enter [the Sanctuary] with his staff, his shoe[s], his money belt, [or] the dust on his feet. And even though I warn you regarding [proper respect for] the Sanctuary, you shall keep My Sabbaths. @rr°@bbThe building of the Temple does not supersede [the] Shabbos [laws].<QC>
@p131@p2<EN>You shall not turn to mediums.@p3 [This is] @rr°@bba warning to mediums and oracles. A @hh<HEB>בַּעַל אוֹב@ee<ENG> [=<TS>a medium] — this is a magician who speaks from his armpit. And an @hh<HEB>יִדְעוֹנִי@ee<ENG> — one who puts the bone of @rr°@bban animal whose name is @ITYadu’a@it into his mouth, and the bone “talks.” @d1Do not seek [them] out,@p3 @rr°@bbto be occupied with them, for if you occupy yourselves with them, you become defiled before Me, and I make you abominable. @d1I am Adonoy your God.@p3 Know Who you exchange for whom.<QC>
@p132@p2<EN>In the presence of the elderly you shall rise.@p3 @rr°@bbPerhaps even an ignorant old man? The verse says: “elder” @rr°@bbonly one who has acquired wisdom is [called] an elder. @d1You shall respect an elder.@p3 What is respect? One should not sit in his place, and not contradict his words. @rr°@bbPerhaps he is permitted to close his eyes as though he does not see him? Therefore it is said, And you shall have fear of your God — for this matter is given over to the discernment of the one who does [the action], for no one but he recognizes [what is in his heart]; and in regard to everything given over to the discernment [of the person doing the action], it is said, “And you shall have fear of your God.” @p133@p2<EN>Do not cause him anguish,@p3 @rr°@bbthe anguish of [wounding] words. Do not say to him: “Yesterday you were an idolator, and now you have come to study Torah that was given from the mouth of the Most High? @p134@p2<EN>For you were strangers in the land of Egypt.@p3 Do not remind your fellow of a defect which you have. @d1I am Adonoy your God.@p3 I am your God and his God!@d1 @p135@p2<EN>You should not commit injustice in judgement.@p3 If [this refers to] judgement [in court], behold, it was already said: “You shall not commit injustice in judgement.” What then is the “justice” repeated here? It [refers to] land-measure, weight and volume-measure. [This] teaches that @rr°@bbone who measures is termed a judge, [so] that if he acts falsely in measure, he is as one who corrupts judgement, and is called corrupter, hateful, detested, doomed to destruction and abomination, @rr°@bband causes five [catastrophic] matters which are said regarding a judge [who judges unjustly]: He defiles the land, profanes the Name [of God], causes the @ITShechinah@it to depart, causes [the] Israel[ites] to fall by the sword, and causes them to be exiled from their land. @d1Measure,@p3 this [refers] to @rr°@bbland measure. @d1Weight,@p3 according to its plain meaning. @d1Volume,@p3 that is @rr°@bbliquid and dry measure. @p136@p2<EN>Just weights,@p3 they are the weights against which one weighs [objects on a balance]. @d1@ITEphah@it [of],@p3 @rr°@bbthat is a dry measure. @d1And a @IThin,@it@p3 @rr°@bbthat is a liquid measure. @d1Who has taken you out [of the land of Egypt] —@p3 for this purpose. Another interpretation: I distinguished in Egypt between the firstborn and those who were not firstborn, and I am faithful to exact punishment from one @rr°@bbwho dips his weights in salt to cheat people who do not recognize [the deceit].<QC>
@p12@p2<EN>And to Bnei Yisroel you shall say:@p3 @rr°@bbthe punishments for the prohibitions [already given]. @d1He shall surely be put to death —@p3 by a court. And if the court does not have the power, @rr°@bbthe people of the land shall assist them. @d1The people of the land,@p3 the people @rr°@bbfor whose sake the land was created, the people who are destined to take possession of the land through these @ITmitzvohs.@it<QC>
@p13@p2<EN>I shall direct My wrath,@p3 My @rr°@bb“free time” — I will turn from all My [other] concerns and concern Myself with him. @d1That man —@p3 @rr°@bband not a congregation, for an entire congregation is not cut off. @d1For he gave of his children to @BIMolech.@p3 Because it is said: “Who causes his son and his daughter to pass through fire,” his son’s son and his daughter’s son — @rr°@bbfrom where [do we know that they are included?] The verse says: “For he gave of his children to @ITMolech.@it” From where [do we know this of] illegitimate offspring? The verse says: “When he gives of his children to @ITMolech.@it” @d1In order to defile My Sanctuary —@p3 the Community of Israel, @rr°@bbwhich is sanctified to Me, as in the expression: “That he not profane My Sanctuary.” @p14@p2<EN>And if they hide [their eyes],@p3 if they hide [their eyes] in one matter, in the end they will hide [their eyes] in many matters. If a minor Sanhedrin hide [their eyes], in the end the Great Sanhedrin will hide [its eyes].<QC>
@p15@p2<EN>And [against] his family.@p3 Said Rabbi Shimon: “What sin did the family commit”? Rather, [this] teaches you that there is no family which has a tax-farmer in it that is not entirely [made up] of tax-farmers — @rr°@bbfor all of them protect him. @d1I shall cut him off.@p3 Why is this said? Since it is said, @BOand against his family,@bo perhaps the entire family will be [punished] with @ITkoreis@it? The verse says: @BOhim@bo — he [will be punished] with @ITkoreis@it, but the entire family [will] not [be punished] with @ITkoreis@it, but with suffering. @d1To go astray after @BIMolech.@p3 @rr°@bb[This phrase] includes worship of any other idol which he served in this way [passing children between the fires], even if this is not [its usual] worship. @p17@p2<EN>You shall sanctify yourselves — @p3 @rr°@bbthis [refers to] separation from idolatry. @p19@p2<EN>He has cursed his father or mother — @p3 [the repetition of] this phrase comes] @rr°@bbto include [cursing them] after [the] death [of either].<QC>
@d1His blood is on him —@p3 this [refers to] stoning, and so too every place it is said “his blood is on him,” “their blood is on them,” [it refers to stoning]. And we have learned this from [the punishment of] an @hh<HEB>אוֹב@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>יִדְעוֹנִי@ee<ENG>, regarding whom it is said: “You shall stone them to death, their blood is on them.” [However,] the plain sense of the verse is similar to “his blood is on his head,” [i.e., the responsibility is his,] no one deserves punishment for his death but himself — he brought it upon himself that he should be executed. @p110@p2<EN>A man,@p3 @rr°@bbexcluding a minor. @d1Who commits adultery with another man’s wife,@p3 excluding a minor’s wife [from the death penalty]. This teaches us that there is no legal marriage for a minor. [If so,] @rr°@bbregarding which married woman have I required you [to exact the death penalty]? @d1Who commits adultery with the wife of his fellow,@p3 excluding a non-Jew’s wife; this teaches us that there is no [binding] marriage for non-Jews.<QC>
@d1They shall surely be put to death — the adulterer and the adulteress.@p3 Any death penalty mentioned in the Torah without [further] specification [as to its nature], [refers] only to @rr°@bbstrangulation. @p112@p2<EN>They have committed an act of perversion,@p3 disgrace. Another interpretation: @rr°@bbThey mix the seed of the father with the seed of the son.<QC>
@p113@p2<EN>In the same manner as with a woman,@p3 [as] one inserts the painting @rr°@bbstick in the tube. @p114@p2<EN>They shall be burnt in fire, he and them.@p3 You cannot say that they should burn his first wife, for he married her legally, and she was [never] forbidden to him, [but] rather “a woman and her mother,” which are written here [is when] both [were] forbidden [to him to begin with] — if he married his mother-in-law and her mother. There are those of our Rabbis who say: Only his mother-in-law is [mentioned] here; [to] what [then does] “them” [refer]? [It means] @rr°@bb“one of them,” [as] in the Greek language” @IThen@it is “one.”<QC>
@p115@p2<EN>And you shall also kill the animal.@p3 If the man sinned, what sin did the animal commit? Rather, because a mishap occurred through it, the verse said: “Let it be stoned.” [This may be argued as] a @ITkal vo-homer@it [All the more so] a human [should be punished], who knows how to distinguish between good and evil, and causes evil to his fellow to commit a sin. Similar to this matter do you say: “You should certainly destroy all the places [where the nations worshipped their gods].” Behold, the matter [gives rise to a] @ITkal vo-homer@it: If trees, which cannot see and cannot hear, [if] because a mishap occurred through them, the Torah said: “Destroy, burn and put an end to” — one who turns his fellow away from the way of life to paths of death, how much more so [should he be punished]!” @p117@p2<EN>It is a shameful perversion.@p3 An Aramaic expression: shamefulness. @rr°@bbAnd its midrashic interpretation: And if you argue that Cain married his sister, [I can reply] that God performed an act of kindness to build up the world through him, as it is said: “The world is built [in] kindness.” @p118@p2<EN>And uncover,@p3 “uncover,” and so every expression of “nakedness” is [an expression] of “uncovering.” The @ITvov@it enters the word @hh<HEB>ערה@ee<ENG> [to convert it] into a noun, like @hh<HEB>זַעֲוָה@ee<ENG> from the root “he did not rise and did not tremble (@hh<HEB>זָע@ee<ENG>),” and so @hh<HEB>אַחֲוָה@ee<ENG> from the root @hh<HEB>אָח@ee<ENG>. As to “uncovering,” our Rabbis disagreed about it. Some say that this [refers] to entrance of the very tip, and other say this [refers] to entrance of the top.<QC>
@p119@p2<EN>The nakedness of your mother’s sister, etc.@p3 The verse repeated its prohibition, to say that he is prohibited regarding them — whether [it involves] his father’s or mother’s sister from the father’s side, or [it involves] their sisters from [the same] mother, but regarding the nakedness of the wife of his father’s brother, he was prohibited only concerning the wife of his father’ brother from [the same] father. @d120. Who will lie [conjugally] with his aunt.@p3 This verse comes to teach regarding @ITkoreis@it mentioned above, @rr°@bbthat it [involves] the punishment of remaining childless. @d1Without children,@p3 as its Targum, “without offspring.” Similar to it: “Since I continue to be childless.” [If] he has children, he buries them; [if] he does not have children, he dies without children. Therefore [the Torah] repeats these two verses: “they will die childless,” “they will remain childless.” @d1They will die without children.@p3 If he has [children] at the time of the sin, he will not have any when he dies, for he will bury them in his own lifetime. @d1They will die without children.@p3 If he has none at the time of the sin, he will remain all his life as he is now. @p121@p2<EN>Who must be [conjugally] avoided [by him].@p3 This cohabitation is to be kept at a distance and is loathsome. And our Rabbis expounded [this verse] to forbid [intimate] contact with her as with a menstruant woman, in regard to whom contact is specified: “he uncovered her source [=<TS>her womb].” @p123@p2<EN>I became disgusted,@p3 an expression of disgust, like “I am disgusted with my life,” as a person who is disgusted with his food.<QC>
@p125@p2<EN>You shall distinguish between a [ritually] clean animal and an unclean one.@p3 It is not necessary to state: between a cow and a donkey, for they are clearly differentiated [in feature and form], but between that which is [ritually] @rr°@bbpure for you and that which is [ritually] impure for you — between [an animal] which has been slaughtered by cutting the greater part of each organ, and one which has been slaughtered [by cutting] half. And how much is there between the greater part and half? A hair’s-breadth. @d1Which I have distinguished for you as being unclean —@p3 @rr°@bbto forbid.<QC>
@p126@p2<EN>And I have distinguished you from the [other] peoples to be mine.@p3 If you are separated from them [by not performing forbidden acts], behold, you are Mine, but if not, behold, you are Nebuchadnezzar’s and his cohorts. Rabbi Eleazar ben Azariyoh says: From where [do we know] that a person should not say: “I am disgusted with pig meat, it is impossible for me to wear mixed kinds,” but rather he should say: “I can, but what can I do, [now] that my Father in Heaven has decreed upon me [that I may not]? The verse says: “And I have distinguished you from the other peoples to be mine,” that your separation from them should be for My Name’s sake — he separates himself from sin and [thus] accepts on himself the yoke of the Kingdom of Heaven. @p127@p2<EN>If there be among them a medium, etc.@p3 Here the death penalty is stated for them, and above [the penalty is] @hh<HEB>כָּרֵת@ee<ENG>. [If there are] witnesses and proper warning, [he is liable] to stoning; [if he does it] intentionally, [but] without [proper] warning, he [receives] @hh<HEB>כָּרֵת@ee<ENG>; and for an unintentional sin, [he must bring a] sin offering, and so in regard to all [sins which involve] liability to the death penalty, regarding which @hh<HEB>כָּרֵת@ee<ENG> is  stated.<QC>

@d1Let him not defile himself among his people,@p3 while the dead body is still @rr°@bb“among his people,” @rr°@bbexcluding a @ITmes mitzvoh@it.<QC>

@d1For her, he may be defiled.@p3 @rr°@bb[It is] a [positive] command. @p14@p2<EN>A husband may not defile himself among his people to become profaned.@p3 He may not defile himself for an illegitimate wife, through whom he becomes unfit [for the @ITkehunoh@it], while she is still with him. And thus the plain meaning of the verse is [as follows]: “A husband may not defile himself” — “with his flesh,” while [the corpse is] yet “among his people” — when there are [people available who can] bury her, [that is,] she is not a @ITmes mitzvoh@it. And regarding what flesh [=<TS>wife] did I speak?@IT@it Regarding one [through] which “he becomes profaned” — to become unfit from his @ITkehunoh@it. @p15@p2<EN>They shall not make baldness@p3 @rr°@bbfor a deceased person. Were not Israelites also prohibited such [conduct]? However, because it was stated regarding Israelites: “[You shall not make any baldness] ’between your eyes’ [for the dead],” Perhaps he is not liable [for plucking out hair] on [any part] of the head [other than “between the eyes”]? The verse says: “on their head” — and [the law of] Israelites is derived from [the law] of @ITkohanim@it by [means of] a @ITgezeroh shovoh@it: “baldness” (@hh<HEB>קָרְחָה@ee<ENG>) is mentioned here and “baldness’ (@hh<HEB>קָרְחָה@ee<ENG>) is mentioned regarding Israelites — just as here [any part of] the entire head [is implied], @rr°@bbso too further on the entire head is implied, wherever he makes a bald spot on the head. And just as further on [the prohibition involves mourning] for a deceased person, so, here [mourning] for a deceased person [is implied].<QC>
@d1And the corners of their beards they shall not shave.@p3 Because regarding an Israelite it is said, “you shall not destroy [by shaving the corner of your beard],”<QC>
@d1@p3@rr°@bbperhaps for plucking with a tweezer or with plane-like tools he is liable? Therefore it is said, “they shall not shave” — he is liable only for something which is called “shaving” and which has in it “destructiveness,” and that [is accomplished only with] a razor. @d1They shall not make gashes in their flesh.@p3 Because it is said regarding an [ordinary] Israelite, “A gash for the dead shall you not make,” perhaps [this means that if he] made five gashes, he is liable for only one? The verse says: “They shall not make gashes” — @rr°@bbto make him liable for each and every gash. for this word [=<TS>“gashes”] is superfluous [and intended] for midrashic exposition, for it should have been written: “They shall not gash,” and I would know that [the verb “gash” refers to] gashes. @p16@p2<EN>They shall be holy.@p3 @rr°@bbThe court shall sanctify them against their will in this. @p17@p2<EN>A harlot,@p3 [A woman] who has had sexual relations with an Israelite who is forbidden for her to marry, under the penalty of @ITkoreis@it [for doing so], or a @hh<HEB>נָתִין@ee<ENG>, or a @hh<HEB>מַמְזֵר@ee<ENG>. @d1A profaned woman,@p3 [that is, a woman] who was born of a marriage [between a @ITkohein@it] and one [forbidden] to the @ITkehunoh@it, as for example the daughter of a widow [illegally married] to a @ITKohein Godol@it, or the daughter of a divorced woman [illegally married] to an ordinary @ITkohein@it. So too one who became invalid [for intermarriage] with the @ITkehunoh@it @rr°@bbbecause she had sexual relations in one of the marriages forbidden to a @ITkohein@it. @p18@p2<EN>You shall make him holy —@p3 [even] @rr°@bbagainst his will, for if he does not wish to divorce [his illegal wife], beat him and punish him until he does divorce [her]. @d1He shall be holy unto you,@p3 treat him with sanctity, to take precedence in all matters [of sanctity], and to bless first at a meal. @p19@p2<EN>Who profanes herself by fornication,@p3 @rr°@bbwhen she becomes profaned through fornication, as when she had [some] @rr°@bbmarital tie with a husband and fornicated, whether [this tie was through] betrothal or marriage. Our Rabbis disagreed about the matter, [but] all agree that the verse does not speak regarding a free woman. @d1She profanes her father.@p3 She has profaned and degraded his honor, for they say of him: “Cursed be he that he caused this one to be born; cursed be he that he raised this one”! @p110@p2<EN>Shall not let [his hair] grow wild,@p3 @rr°@bbit shall not grow wild in mourning. And what is [the measure] of “growing wild”? More than thirty days. @p111@p2<EN>And adjacent to any dead body, etc.@p3 [That is,] in[to] @rr°@bba tent [which is over a] dead body. @d1Dead body @p3[literally, “souls of a dead body”] — to include @rr°@bba quarter [of a @hh<HEB>לוֹג@ee<ENG>] of blood from a dead body, which causes impurity in a “tent.” @d1For his father and his mother he shall not become [ritually] impure.@p3 This comes only @rr°@bbto permit him [to become impure] for a @ITmes mitzvoh@it. @p112@p2<EN>He shall not depart from the Sanctuary.@p3 He does not follow the coffin. Furthermore, our Rabbis learned from here that a @ITKohein Godol@it @rr°@bbmay offer [a sacrifice] while he is an @ITonein@it, and this is its meaning: Even if his father and his mother died, he is not required to leave the Sanctuary, but performs the Temple-service. @d1And he shall not profane.<TIE>.<TIE>.the Sanctuary,@p3 He does not profane the Temple-service with this, since Scripture permitted him [to remain there]; thus, [we learn,] that an ordinary @ITkohein@it who performs [the Temple-service] while he is an @ITonein@it @ITdoes@it profane [it]. @p114@p2<EN>And a profaned woman,@p3 @rr°@bbborn of [a marriage] forbidden to the @ITkehunoh@it. @p115@p2<EN>He shall not profane his offspring —@p3 thus, if he marries one [of those] women invalid [for marriage with @ITkohanim@it], his offspring from her is @rr°@bbprofaned from the status of the holiness of the @ITkehunoh@it. @p117@p2<EN>The bread of his God,@p3 @rr°@bb“the food” of his God. Every meal is called “food,” as [in the verse] “he made a great feast.” @p118@p2<EN>For any man who has a blemish shall not approach.@p3 @rr°@bbIt is not proper that he approach; [the word “approach”] is like [that in the verse] “[If you offer the lame or sick, is it not evil?] Offer it now to your governor; [will he be pleased with you?].” @d1A man with a sunken nose,@p3 [one] whose nose is sunken between the two eyes, [so that] he can paint @rr°@bbboth his eyes with one stroke. @d1A man who has disproportionate limbs,@p3 [one who has] one limb larger than the other — one eye large and one eye small, or one thigh is @rr°@bblonger than the other.<QC>
@p120@p2<EN>One with overhanging eyebrows.@p3 @ITSorzilos@it in Old French, [denoting one whose] eyebrows — their hair is long and lies [over his face]. @d1Or with a cataract,@p3 who has a membrane in his eyes, which is called @ITtoyle@it [in Old French], similar [to the use of the word in the verse]: “Who spreads out [the heavens] like a membrane.” @d1Or a disarrangement [in the eye],@p3 something which confuses the eye, such as a white streak which stretches from the white [of the eye] and intersects the iris — the circle which surrounds the black [of the eye], [that] which is called @ITprunelle@it in Old French. This streak intersects the circle and enters the black [of the eye]. The Targum of @hh<HEB>תְּבַלוּל@ee<ENG> is @hh<HEB>חִילִּיז@ee<ENG>, a word [related to] @hh<HEB>חִלָּזוֹן@ee<ENG>, for that streak is similar to a worm, and so the Sages of Israel termed it, [when describing] the blemishes [which can befall] a firstling: worm, @rr°@bbsnake, wart. @d1Scurf [=<TS>@BIgorov@BO] or scabs [=<TS>@BIyallefes@BO].@p3 These are types of boils. “Scurf” is [what is called elsewhere] @ITcheres@it, a boil [which is] dry within and without [on the surface]; “scab” is the Egyptian lichen. And why is it called @ITyallefes@it? Because it continues to cling [to the body] until the day of death, and it is moist without and dry within, and in another place @ITgorov@it is called @ITshechin@it — moist without and dry within, as it is said, “and with the scab [=<TS>@ITgorov@it] and with the itch [=<TS>@ITcheres@it].” When [the word] “scurf” [=<TS>@ITgorov@it] [appears] near @ITcheres@it, [then] “scab” [=<TS>@ITyallefes@it] is called “scurf” [=<TS>@ITgorov@it], [but] when it [=<TS>@ITgorov@it] [appears] near “scab” [=<TS>@ITyallefes@it], @ITcheres@it is called “scurf” [=<TS>@ITgorov@it] — so is it explained in Bechoros. @d1Or one with crushed testicles,@p3 [which is,] according to the Targum: @rr°@bb@hh<HEB>מְרֵס פַּחֲדִין@ee<ENG>, whose @hh<HEB>פַּחֲדִין@ee<ENG> are @hh<HEB>מְרוּסָסִין@ee<ENG> — his testicles are crushed. [The word] @hh<HEB>פַּחֲדִין@ee<ENG> is related [to its meaning in the verse]: “All the sinews of his testicles are knit together.” @p121@p2<EN>Any man who has a blemish —@p3 [this comes] @rr°@bbto include other blemishes. @d1He has a blemish,@p3 while “he has a blemish,” he is unfit; therefore, if the blemish passes, he is fit. @d1The bread of his God,@p3 @rr°@bbevery food is called “bread.” @p122@p2<EN>Of the most holy [sacrifices] —@p3 these are the most holy sacrifices. @d1And from the holy, he may eat.@p3 These are the sacrifices of lesser sanctity. If sacrifices of greater sanctity are mentioned, why are sacrifices of lesser sanctity [also] mentioned? If it had not been said, @rr°@bbI would have thought: A blemished person may eat of the most holy sacrifices, since we find that they were permitted to a non-@ITkohein@it, [as when] Moshe ate the flesh of the installation-sacrifices. But [I might think] that of the breast and thigh of sacrifices of lesser sanctity he may not eat, since we do not find that a non-@ITkohein@it had a part in them — therefore sacrifices of lesser sanctity are mentioned. So is it explained in [the Maseches of] Zevochim. @p123@p2<EN>However, [he may not enter] beyond the curtain,@p3 @rr°@bbto sprinkle seven sprinklings on the curtain. @d1And to the altar,@p3 the outer [one]. And both [the curtain and the altar] had to be written, and [the reason] is explained in Toras Kohanim. @d1He shall not profane My holy things.@p3 For if he did perform [the service],<FJ> @rr°@bbhis service is profaned and becomes invalid. @p124@p2<EN>Moshe spoke@p3 this @ITmitzvah@it. @d1To Aharon and to his sons and to all of Bnei Yisroel —@p3 @rr°@bbto warn the court regarding the @ITkohanim@it. @p12@p2<EN> And let them keep away,@p3 [The word] @hh<HEB>נְזִירָה@ee<ENG> refers to “separation,” and so too [the verse] says: “And he separates himself from following Me,” “They are gone away backward,” [thus implying here:] they shall separate [themselves] from holy things in the days of their impurity. And let them keep away from the holy offerings of Bnei Yisroel, which they sanctify for Me, and not profane My Holy Name. @rr°@bbReverse the verse and expound it. @d1Which they sanctify for Me,@p3 [this redundancy comes] to include the holy offerings of the @ITkohanim@it themselves. @p13@p2<EN>Any person who shall draw near.@p3 This [expression of] “drawing near” refers to eating, and so we have found that the prohibition of eating holy flesh while [in a state of ritual] uncleanness is expressed by [a word implying] “touching”: “Anything holy she shall not touch” — which is a prohibition for one who eats [the flesh], and our Rabbis derived it @rr°@bbfrom a @ITgezeroh shovoh@it. And it is impossible to say that he is liable for touching, since @ITkoreis@it is mentioned regarding eating in [the @ITSidroh@it] of @ITTzav es Aharon:@it Two @ITkerisos@it are [mentioned] next to one another, and if he is liable for touching, it would not have been necessary to make him liable for eating± so is it expounded in Toras Kohanim: Is then a @ITkohein@it who [merely] touches [sacrificial flesh when he is unclean] liable [to @ITkoreis@it]? If so, why does the verse say: “who draws near” [rather than “who eats”]? [It is said in order to teach that] once it is fit to be offered [=<TS>brought near], they [=<TS>those who eat it] are not liable for uncleanness @rr°@bbunless that which makes it permissible is offered. @rr°@bbAnd if you say: Why are three @ITkerisos@it regarding impurity of @ITkohanim@it? [They] were already expounded in Maseches Shevu’os: One is [to teach] a general rule [regarding all sacrifices], one [teaches the rule regarding] a particular case, etc. [and one to teach regarding a sliding-scale sacrifice, which is recorded only to prescribe atonement for the uncleanness of the Temple and its holy food]. @d1While his impurity is on him —@p3 and the impurity of a @IThuman being@it is on him. Perhaps the verse speaks of the impurity of flesh — “and the impurity of the [sacrificial] flesh is on it”? — And regarding a clean [@ITkohein@it] who ate unclean [flesh], does scripture speak? [No.] You are forced to learn from what is implied in it. Of one whose impurity @rr°@bbpasses away from him, does the verse speak. And this refers to a @IThuman being@it whose purification is by immersion. @d1Shall be cut off.@p3 Perhaps [he shall be uprooted] from this side [of the world] to the [other] side [of the world]? [Perhaps] he will be cut off [=<TS>exiled] from his [native] place and be settled in another place? The verse says: @d1“I am Adonoy” —@p3 [he will be cut off] from wherever I am.<FJ> @p14@p2<EN>Anything defiled by the dead,@p3 [referring] to one who becomes [ritually] impure by [contact] with the dead. @p15@p2<EN>Any creeping creature that causes impurity to him,@p3 in the minimum size which is capable of causing impurity, [that is, the size of] @rr°@bba lentil. @d1Or any person,@p3 @rr°@bba dead body. @d1Who causes impurity to him,@p3 in [the] minimum size to cause impurity, and that is [the volume of] @rr°@bban olive’s-bulk. @d1[With] whatever impurity he has,@p3 this includes @rr°@bbone who touches a @ITzov@it, or a @ITzovoh@it, or a @ITniddoh@it, or a woman who has just given birth. @p16@p2<EN>Anyone touching [that person] —@p3 @rr°@bbany of these [ritually] unclean [persons]. @p17@p2<EN>And afterwards, he may eat of the holy things.@p3 [This] is expounded in [Maseches] Yevomos [as concerning] @rr°@bb@ITterumoh@it, which [@ITkohanim@it] are permitted to eat at sunset. @d1Of the holy things —@p3 but not @ITall@it the holy things. @p18@p2<EN>An animal which has died on its own, or an animal that was fatally maimed, he must not eat to defile himself with it.@p3 [This verse] warns @rr°@bbregarding the matter of uncleanness. That if he ate the carcass of a [ritually] clean bird, @rr°@bbwhich has no [rule of] uncleanness of touch and carrying, except for the uncleanness [caused by] eating as soon as it is in the gullet — he is forbidden to eat holy things. [Furthermore,] it was necessary to state @ITu’trefah@it, [to indicate that the word @ITneveiloh@it] [refers to] an animal whose species includes a @ITtrefah@it — excluding the carcass of an @ITunclean@it bird which does not include a @ITtrefah@it within its species. @p19@p2<EN>They shall keep My charge@p3 @rr°@bbnot to eat @ITterumoh@it while [in a state of] bodily uncleanness. @d1And die because of it.@p3 This has taught us that [violation of this prohibition] is [punishable] by death @rr°@bbat the hands of Heaven.<QC>
@p110@p2<EN>No stranger (non-@BIkohein@BO) may eat holy things.@p3 The verse speaks of @ITterumoh@it, for the whole passage speaks of it. @d1One indentured to a @BIkohein@BO or one hired —@p3 [that is,] the indentured servant of a @ITkohein@it @rr°@bbor his hired hand. That is why [the word] “@hh<HEB>תּוֹשַׁב@ee<ENG>“ is vocalized with a @hh<HEB>פַּתַּח @ee<ENG>, because it is connected [to the following word]. And what is a @hh<HEB>תּוֹשָׁב@ee<ENG>?

One who belongs [to his master] for [a period] of years, @rr°@bbwho leaves [his master’s service] in six years. The verse has come and taught you here, that he does not belong bodily to his master [which would allow him to] eat @ITterumoh@it. @p111@p2<EN>If a @BIkohein@BO shall purchase a person [as a slave],@p3 @rr°@bba Canaanite slave who belongs bodily [to his master]. @d1And the [slave] born in his house,@p3 these are the children of the maidservants.

Therefore it was said above: “Any man” — to include non-Jews who may make vows and bring free-will-offerings as [do] Israelites. @d1Wounds,@p3 wounds, (quoting Targum). @d1They will not be favorably accepted for you,@p3 @rr°@bbto atone for you. @p127@p2<EN>When it is born,@p3 excluding a Caesarian section.<QL>
@p128@p2<EN>It and its offspring.@p3 [This rule] applies to a female [animal], for it is forbidden to slaughter @rr°@bbthe mother [together with] the son or daughter [on the same day]. It does not apply to male [animals], @rr°@bband it is permitted to slaughter the father and the son. @d1It and its offspring,@p3 @rr°@bbeven its offspring and it are implied [in the expression]. @p129@p2<EN>That it be favorably accepted for you shall you sacrifice it.@p3 [That is, at] the outset of its slaughtering, be careful that it should bring acceptance for you, and what is it that assures its acceptance?<QC>
@p130@p2<EN>On that day [that it is sacrificed] it may be eaten.@p3 This comes to warn that the slaughtering should be for this purpose — do not slaughter it in order to eat it tomorrow, for if you have invalidating thoughts, it will not be acceptable for you. Another interpretation: @d1That it be favorably accepted for you — @p3consciously; from here [we learn] that one who is preoccupied [and in this state slaughters an offering], it is invalid in regard to the slaughter of holy offerings. And even though it detailed [this rule] in regard to [sacrifices] eaten for two days [and the night between], [the verse] @rr°@bbagain detailed [it here], regarding [those] eaten for one day — that their slaughter should be with the intention to eat them in their [proper] time. @d1<EN>On that day [that it is sacrificed] you should eat it.@p3 This comes only to warn that the slaughter should be for this purpose, for if [it comes] to set a time of eating, [that] was already written: “The flesh of his peace-offering for thanksgiving [shall be eaten on the day of his offering].” @d1I am Adonoy.@p3 Know Who decrees [this] thing, and let it not be trivial in your eyes. @p131@p2<EN>You shall preserve —@p3 @rr°@bbthis [refers] to study. @d1And fulfill — @p3this [refers] to action. @p132@p2<EN>You shall not profane,@p3 @rr°@bbto transgress My words intentionally. Since it is said, “and you shall not profane,” why does the verse say, “and I will be sanctified”? @rr°@bbSurrender yourself [to martyrdom] and sanctify My Name! Perhaps [this command applies even when] he is alone? The verse says: @d1Among Bnei Yisroel.@p3 And when he surrenders himself, he should surrender himself in order to die, for whoever surrenders himself [to martyrdom] for the sake of a miracle, a miracle is not performed for him. For so we find in [the case of] Chananiyoh, Misho’el and Azariyoh, who did not surrender themselves for the sake of a miracle, as it is said, “But if not [=<TS> if He does not save us], be it known to you, o King, [that we will not serve your gods], etc.” — whether He saves [us] or whether he does not save [us], it should be known to you, etc. [=<TS>that we will not serve your idols] @p133@p2<EN>Who brought you out — @p3for this purpose. @d1I am Adonoy,@p3 @rr°@bbfaithful to give reward. @p12@p2<EN>Speak to Bnei Yisroel, [and say to them], the appointed times.@p3 Regulate the appointed times so that [the] Israel[ites] should become practiced in them.

To teach you that whoever profanes the festivals is considered as though he profaned the @ITShabbasos@it, and whoever keeps the festivals is considered as though he kept the @ITShabbasos@it. @p14@p2<EN>These are the appointed times of Adonoy.@p3 Above [the verse] speaks of proclaiming a leap year, and here it speaks of @rr°@bbsanctification of the month. @p15@p2<EN>In the afternoon,@p3 @rr°@bbfrom six hours onward. @d1A Pesach (offering) for Adonoy,@p3 [referring] to bringing @rr°@bbthe sacrifice whose name is Pesach.<QR>
@p18@p2<EN>You shall bring a fire-offering, etc.@p3 These are the additional sacrifices which are mentioned in Parshas Pinchos. And why are they mentioned here? To say that the[se] additional sacrifices do not impede one another, [since it states]: @d1You shall bring a fire-offering to Adonoy,@p3 [bring it] under any circumstance if there are no oxen [available], bring rams, and if there are no oxen or rams, bring lambs. @d1[On each of] seven days.@p3 Wherever @hh<HEB>שִׁבְעַת@ee<ENG>, (“seven”) is said, it is a noun — a week of days, @rr°@bb@ITseteyne@it in Old French, and so too every expression of “eight of,” “six of.” “five of,” “three of.” @d1You shall not do any work of labor.@p3 Even that work which is considered as necessary labor, which cause[s] monetary loss by its neglect, such as an opportunity which is lost. So have I understood from Toras Kohanim, which teaches: @rr°@bb“Perhaps even [during] the intermediate days of the festival the work of labor should be forbidden? Etc. @p110@p2<EN>First fruits of your harvest —@p3 that it should be @rr°@bbthe first of the harvest. @d1An @ITomer@it, @p3a tenth of an @ITephoh@it — @rr°@bbsuch was its name, as: “[when] they measured [it] by the @ITomer@it.”<QC>
@p111@p2<EN>He shall wave.@p3 Every waving [denotes that] he moves [it] @rr°@bbhorizontally away from him and toward him, vertically upwards and downwards; horizontally away from him and toward him — to prevent destructive winds, [and] vertically upwards and downwards — @rr°@bbto prevent harmful dews. @d1Be favorably accepted for you.@p3 If you bring [it] according to this rule, it will be favorably accepted for you. @d1On the day after the day of rest,@p3 the day after the first festival day of Pesach, for if you say that [this refers] to @rr°@bbthe Shabbos of Creation, @rr°@bbyou [cannot] know which [Shabbos] is meant. @p112@p2<EN>You shall prepare.<TIE>.<TIE>.a lamb,@p3 [which] comes as @rr°@bban obligation in connection with the @ITomer@it [meal-offering]. @p113@p2<EN>Its meal-offering,@p3 @rr°@bbthe meal-offering [which accompanies] its wine-offering. @d1Two tenths — @p3it was double. @d1Its wine-offering is one fourth of a @IThin@it.@bo@p3 Even though its meal-offering was double, its wine-offering was not double. @p114@p2<EN>Parched grain,@p3 flour made from tender grain, which is dried in an oven. @d1Tender grain,@p3 those are the parched grains, which are called @ITgreneds@it [in Old French]. @d1In all your dwelling places.@p3 The Sages of Israel disagreed about this. Some learned from this that [the prohibition] of @hh<HEB>חָדָשׁ@ee<ENG> applies outside the land [of Israel], and some say that this comes only to teach [us] that we were not commanded regarding @hh<HEB>חָדָשׁ@ee<ENG> until after taking possession and settling [the land], after conquering and dividing [it among the tribes]. @p115@p2<EN>From the day after the day of rest,@p3 the day after the festival.<QC>
@d1Seven complete weeks shall they be.@p3 [This] teaches that one should begin [to] count at night, for if not so, they [=<TS>the seven weeks] are not complete. @p116@p2<EN>The seventh week,@p3 @rr°@bbas its Targum: “the seventh week.” @d1Until the day after the seventh week, you shall count [fifty days].@p3 But not including [the day] until which you count — and those are the forty-nine days [referred to]. @d1Fifty days, and you shall bring a new meal-offering for Adonoy.@p3 Bring it @rr°@bbon the fiftieth day. I say this is its Midrash, but its plain meaning is: “Until the day after the seventh week — which is the fiftieth day — you should count” [and then bring the offering]. [This] is an inverted verse. @d1A new meal-offering.@p3 “That is the first meal-offering which is brought from @ITchodosh@it, and if you say: “But the @ITomer@it meal-offering has [already] been brought”! [The @ITomer@it meal-offering] is not like other meal-offerings, for it comes from @rr°@bbbarley. @p117@p2<EN>From your dwelling places — @p3and not from outside the land [of Israel]. @d1Bread wave-offering,@p3 the bread [to be] raised, which is raised [=<TS>offered] @rr°@bbfor the Most High, and this is the “new meal-offering” mentioned above. @d1First fruit-offering,@p3 first of all the meal-offerings — even of the “jealousy” meal-offering which comes from barley, @rr°@bbmay not be brought from @ITchodosh@it before the “two breads.”<QC>
@p118@p2<EN>Along with the bread,@p3 for the sake of the bread, @rr°@bban obligation of the bread. @d1With their meal-offerings and wine-offerings,@p3 according to the rule of meal-offerings and wine-offerings explained regarding every animal [sacrifice] in the @ITporoshoh@it of wine-offerings: three tenths for each ox and two tenths for each ram, and a tenth for each lamb — this is the meal-offering. [As for] the wine-offerings: half a @IThin@it for each ox, a third of a @IThin@it for each ram, and a fourth of a @IThin@it for each lamb.<QC>
@p119@p2<EN>You shall prepare one he-goat.@p3 Perhaps the seven lambs and the he-goat mentioned here are identical with the seven lambs and he-goat mentioned in @hh<HEB>חוּמַּשׁ הַפְּקוּדִים@ee<ENG>? When you reach the [listing] of oxen and rams, [you see] that it is not so. You must conclude from this [that] @rr°@bbthese are [a group] unto themselves and these are [a group] unto themselves. These are brought for the sake of the bread, and these are for the additional sacrifices. @p120@p2<EN>The @BIkohein@BO shall wave them, a wave-offering.@p3 [This] teaches that they require waving @rr°@bb[while] alive. Perhaps all of them? The verse says: “with the two lambs.”<QC>
@d1They shall be holy.@p3 Because peace-offerings brought by an individual [are classified] as holy things of a lesser degree, it was necessary to state of communal peace-offerings, that they are @rr°@bbholy things of a greater degree. @p122@p2<EN>When you reap.@p3 [The verse] repeats [the prohibition] so that a transgressor violates two prohibitions. Said R. Avdimi son of R. Yosef: Why did Scripture place it [=<TS>this agricultural prohibition] in the midst of the festival [laws], Pesach and Shevu’os on one side, Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, and Sukkos on the other? [In order] to teach you that whoever gives gleanings, the forgotten sheaf and the corner of the field to the poor person [in a] proper [manner], is considered as though he built the Temple and brought his sacrifices within it. @d1You shall leave,@p3 @rr°@bbleave [it] before them and they will gather [it], and you must not help any one of them [in preference to anyone else]. @d1I am Adonoy, your God,@p3 faithful to give a reward.<QC>
@p124@p2<EN>A remembrance of the sounding [of the @BIshofor@BO].@p3 A mention of Biblical verses [which relate] to [Divine] Remembrances and Biblical verses [which relate to the] @ITshofor@it — @rr°@bbto remember for your sake the binding of Yitzchok for whom a ram was brought in his stead. @p125@p2<EN>You shall bring a fire-offering,@p3 the additional offerings mentioned in @hh<HEB>חוּמַשׁ הַפְּקוּדִים@ee<ENG>.<QC>
@p127@p2<EN>Indeed.@p3 Every time “however” and “indeed (except),” [are mentioned] in the Torah [they represent] a limitation. [Here, the limitation is this:] [Yom Kippur] atones for those who repent, but does not atone for those who do not repent.<QC>
@p130@p2<EN>I will cause [that person] to perish.@p3 Because [the verse] says “cutting off” everywhere [else], and I do not know what that is, [here] when it says, “I will cause [that person] to perish” it teaches that @ITkoreis@it is nothing other than destruction.<QC>
@p131@p2<EN>Any work, etc.@p3 [This is repeated to teach that one who does work on Yom Kippur] transgresses many prohibitions, or to [teach that] @rr°@bbwork at night is prohibited, just as working during the day [is prohibited].<QC>
@p135@p2<EN>A holy assembly.@p3 Sanctify it with fine clothing and with prayer, and in regard to other festivals, [sanctify them] with food, drink, @rr°@bbfine clothing and prayer.<QC>
@p136@p2<EN>It is [a day] of convocation.@p3 I have kept you with me, like a king who invited his children for a feast for a certain number of days, when the time came for them to leave, he said: “My children, I beg of you, remain with me one more day; your leaving is difficult for me.” @d1Any work of labor,@p3 even work which is labor for yourselves, that if you do not do it, there will be a loss [to you] in the matter — @d1You shall not do.@p3 Perhaps [this applies to] the intermediate days of the festival, that [all] work or labor should be forbidden? The verse says: “It [is a day of convocation].” @p137@p2<EN>A burnt-offering and a meal-offering,@p3 a meal-offering [which accompanies] the wine-offering which is brought @rr°@bbwith the burnt-offering. @d1Each on its assigned day,@p3 a quantity fixed @rr°@bbin Chumash Hapekudim. @d1Each on its assigned day —@p3 therefore, if the day has passed, the sacrifice is cancelled. @p139@p2<EN>Indeed, on the fifteenth day, you shall celebrate —@p3 [bringing] a peace-offering [as] sacrifice for the pilgrim’s sacrifice. Perhaps this [sacrifice] supersedes Shabbos? The verse says: “However,” [which is a limitation]; since it has [a supplementary period] for repayment all seven [days of the festival]. @d1When you gather the produce of the land —@p3 that this seventh month should come at the time of harvest. From here [we learn] that they were commanded to intercalate the years, for if it were not for this addition of a month, at times [Sukkos would fall] during the middle of the summer or the winter.<QC>
@d1You shall celebrate —@p3 peace-offerings for the festival sacrifice. @d1Seven days,@p3 if he did not bring [the sacrifice] on one [day], he brings it another [day]. Perhaps he brings them all seven [days]? The verse says: @d1You shall celebrate it —@p3 one day is meant, and not more. Why [then] is “seven” said? For the [supplementary] payment period. @p140@p2<EN>Fruit of the beautiful tree,@p3 a tree the taste of whose wood and fruit are the same. @d1Beautiful,@p3 @rr°@bbwhich remain on its tree from year to year — and this is the @hh<HEB>אֶתְרג@ee<ENG> [=<TS>citron]. @d1A branch of palm trees.@p3 [Since the word @hh<HEB>כַּפּוֹת@ee<ENG>, “branches” appears] without a @ITvov@it, this teaches that there is only @rr°@bbone [palm branch]. @d1Boughs of thick-leaved trees,@p3 whose branches are intertwined like ropes and like cords, and this is the @hh<HEB>הֲדַס@ee<ENG> [=<TS>myrtle] which is shaped like a braid.<QC>
@p142@p2<EN>Native born,@p3 @rr°@bbthis is the native-born, [and so the word] @d1Israelite@p3 [which follows, is seemingly unnecessary, and comes] to include converts. @p143@p2<EN>That in the @BIsukkos@BO I caused to dwell,@p3 [in] clouds of glory.<QC>
@p12@p2<EN> Command Bnei Yisroel.@p3 This is the section concerning the @ITmitzvoh@it of the [Tabernacle] lamps. And the section in the @ITporoshoh@it of Ve-Atoh Tetzavveh, was mentioned [there] only for the sake of the Order of the Work of the Tabernacle, to explain the purpose of the @ITmenorah@it, and so it implies: You will in the end command Bnei Yisroel regarding this. @d1Pure, pressed olive oil.@p3 Three oils come forth from the olive: [the oil of] the first [pressing] is called “pure” — and [these three oils] are explained in [Maseches] Menochos, and @ITToras Kohanim@it. @d1Continually,@p3 from night to night, like [the expression] “a continual burnt-offering,” which [comes] only from day to day. @p13@p2<EN>The Curtain of Testimony,@p3 which is before the Ark, which is called “Testimony.” And our Rabbis expounded [this as referring] to @rr°@bbthe westernmost lamp, which is testimony for all the world’s inhabitants that the Divine Presence dwells in the midst of Israel. [This is because the @ITKohein Godol@it] places as much oil in it as for the other lamps, [but] from it he would begin [to light the lamps] @rr°@bband with it he would end. @d1Aharon shall arrange it [so that it burns] from evening until morning.@p3 He should arrange it in a suitable arrangement according to the length of each night; the Sages estimated [this] at half a @ITlog@it for each lamp, and this was fit for even the [long] nights of the Teves season, and this measure was set for them [for the entire year]. @p14@p2<EN>The pure menorah,@p3 [that is, the menorah] which is [made of] pure gold. @rr°@bbAnother interpretation: [He should arrange the lamps] on the purity of the menorah, [by] first purifying it and cleaning it of its ashes. @p16@p2<EN>Six in each stack —@p3 @rr°@bbsix loaves in one stack. @d1The pure table,@p3 [that is, the table made] of pure gold. Another interpretation: [The loaves should be placed] @rr°@bbon the “purity” of the table, that the supportsshould not raise the [lowest loaves of] bread @rr°@bbabove the table. @p17@p2<EN>You shall put on [each] stack,@p3 @rr°@bbon each one of the two stacks; there were two bowls of frankincense [in all], a fistful [of frankincense] for each one [=<TS>bowl]. @d1And it shall be — @p3this frankincense, @d1as a memorial portion for the bread,@p3 because of the bread itself nothing was offered to the all-Highest except that the frankincense was burnt when the bread was removed from the Table every Shabbos; and it is the memorial portion for the bread, for by means of it, it [=<TS>the bread] is remembered Above, similar to the fistful which is the memorial portion for the meal-offering. @p19@p2<EN>It shall belong — @p3this meal-offering, for any [offering] that comes from crops is [considered in the category of] meal-offering. @d1And they shall eat it,@p3 referring to the bread, which is a masculine [noun]. @p110@p2<EN>The son of an Israelite woman went out.@p3 From where did he go out? R. Levi says: @rr°@bbHe went out of his [everlasting] world. R. Berechiah says: From the section above he set out [to ridicule]. He mocked [the showbread], saying: “’On each and @rr°@bbevery Shabbos he shall arrange them!’ It is the custom of a king to eat fresh bread every day, is it then [his way to eat] a cold loaf nine days old”? In astonishment. A teaching states: He went out guilty from Moshe’s court. He had come to pitch his tent in the midst of the tribe of Dan. They asked him: “What right have you to be here”? He said to them: “I am of the descendants of Dan.” They said to him: “Each man [shall camp] by his own flag, [that bears] the signs of their father’s house,” it is written He entered Moshe’s court and went out guilty. [whereupon] he stood up and blasphemed [=<TS>cursed]. @d1And he was the son of an Egyptian man —@p3 he was the Egyptian @rr°@bbwhom Moshe killed. @d1Among Bnei Yisroel —@p3 [this] teaches that @rr°@bbhe was converted. @d1They argued in the encampment —@p3 regarding matters [concerning] the encampment. @d1And the Israelite man —@p3 the one against him, @rr°@bbwho protested against his pitching his tent. @p111@p2<EN>Clearly pronounced,@p3 as its Targum: “and he pronounced,” that he clearly pronounced the Proper Name, and blasphemed — it [the Name he used] is the Explicit Name he heard at Sinai. @d1The name of his mother was Shelomis, daughter of Divri.@p3 It is to the credit of Israel that this verse publicized this one, to say that @rr°@bbshe alone was a wayward woman. @d1Shlomis.@p3 [She was called this] because she would chatter, “Be well”! “Be well” “Be well”! babbling [many] words, asking [about] everyone’s health. @d1Daughter of Divri.@p3 She was a chatterer, speaking with every person [who came her way], and therefore she became corrupted. @d1Of the tribe of Dan.@p3 [This] tells that an evil person causes disgrace to himself, disgrace to his father, disgrace to his tribe. Similarly, “Oholiov son of Achisomoch, of the tribe of Dan” — a credit to him, a credit to his father, a credit to his tribe. @p112@p2<EN>They placed him [in the guardhouse] —@p3 @rr°@bbby himself, and they did not place the wood-gatherer with him, though the two of them were [in custody] during the same period of time. They knew @rr°@bbthat one who gathered wood [on Shabbos] was [condemned] to death, as it is said, “anyone who profanes it shall be put to death,” but @rr°@bbthe execution itself had not been explained to them. Therefore it is said, “For it had not been explained [to them] what should be done to him.” But regarding the blasphemer [the verse] says: “to explain to them” — for they did not know if he was liable to death or not. @p114@p2<EN>Those who heard him. —@p3 These are the witnesses. @d1All — @p3[this comes] to includes the judges.<QC>
@d1Their hands.@p3 They say to him: “Your blood is on your head, and we are not punished for your death, @rr°@bbfor you caused [it] to yourself. @d1The entire congregation,@p3 @rr°@bbin the presence of the entire congregation. (From here) we learn that a man’s agent is like the man himself. @p115@p2<EN>Shall bear [the burden] of his sin — @p3 with @ITkoreis@it, when there is no warning. @p116@p2<EN>Whoever pronounces clearly —@p3 he is not guilty until he pronounces the Name clearly, and not one who blasphemes by one of [God’s] titles. @d1And whoever pronounces.@p3 “Pronounces” here is an expression of “cursing,” as [in the verse] “Why should I curse”?<QC>
@p117@p2<EN>Any man who kills.@p3 Since it is said, “If one strikes a man and [the victim dies]” I [know that this applies] only when he killed a man, from where [do I know] [if he killed] a woman or minor? The verse [here] says: “any human being.”<QC>
@p120@p2<EN>So shall it be done to him.@p3 Our Rabbis explained that [this] does not [mean] placing an actual blemish [on him], but [rather] the payment of money. @rr°@bbWe appraise [his worth] as a slave [being sold in a slave-market]. Therefore [@hh<HEB>יִנָתֵן@ee<ENG>,] “giving” is written regarding it — something which is given from hand to hand. @p121@p2<EN>Whoever smites an animal shall pay for it,@p3 above (verse 18), [it] spoke of one who kills an animal, and here it speaks of one @rr°@bbwho causes a wound to it. @d1Whoever smites a person shall be put to death,@p3 even if he did not kill him, but [merely] caused a wound, for here [the word] “soul” does not appear. And of one who smites @rr°@bbhis father or his mother. [this] verse speaks, and [this verse is placed here] to compare [this case] to one who smites an animal: Just as one who smites an animal [when it is] alive [is liable], so [too] one who smites his father [when he is] alive [is liable] — excluding one who smites [his father or mother] after [their] death. Since we find that one who curses [one’s father and mother even] after death, is liable to the death[-penalty], it was necessary to state [the law] regarding one who smites [a parent’s body after death] that he is exempt [from the death penalty]. [The comparison goes the other way as well:] Just as [for wounding] an animal, [one must pay compensation], [for] if there is no wound there is no payment, so [too] one who strikes his father is not liable [to the death-penalty] until he causes a wound to him. @p122@p2<EN>For I am Adonoy, your God,@p3 the God of all of you; just as I attach My Name to you, so I attach it to converts.<QC>
@p123@p2<EN>And Bnei Yisroel did — @p3 [they carried out] the complete @ITmitzvoh@it of stoning mentioned elsewhere [on the blasphemer]: casting [the condemned man down from a height], the heaping of stones [on him], and hanging [his body  afterwards].<QC>
@p11@p2<EN>On Mount Sinai.@p3 What has the matter of the Sabbatical year [to do] with Mount Sinai? Were not all the @ITmitzvos@it said at Sinai? Rather, [this come to teach that] just as @ITshemittoh@it its general rules, details, and specifications were said at Sinai, so [too] all of them (the @ITmitzvos@it) [including] their general rules and specifications. were said at Sinai, So is it taught in @ITToras Kohanim@it. And it seems to me that such is its explanation: Since we do not find that land @ITshemittoh@it was repeated at the Plains of Moab in @ITSefer Devorim@it, we have learned that its general rules and its details — all of them — were said at Sinai. And the verse comes [to] teach [us] here that every utterance which was prophetically said to Moshe, that all of them were from Sinai — their general rules and their specifications — and they were repeated at the Plains of Moab. @p12@p2<EN>A @BIShabbos@BO for Adonoy,@p3 for God’s sake, as it was said regarding the Shabbos of creation @p14@p2<EN>Shall be [a @BIShabbos@BO of rest] for the land,@p3 for the fields and vineyards. @d1You shall not prune.@p3 [That is,] that they cut off its branches; and its Targum is: “you shall not cut off,” and similar to it is “as thorns cut off,” “it is burnt with fire, it is cut down.” @p15@p2<EN>@p3@d1Crops which grew on their own,@p3 even if you did not sow [them], [but they] sprouted from the seed which falls on it [=<TS>the land] at the time of reaping, and that is called @hh<HEB>סָפִיחַ@ee<ENG>. @d1You shall not reap,@p3 [in order] to retain it with the rest of the harvest, but it should be ownerless — free to all. @d1Your untended vines,@p3 which you have kept secluded and from which you have kept people away, and you have not declared ownerless. @d1You shall not gather —@p3 those you may not gather, but from [that which is] ownerless, [you may gather]. @p16@p2<EN>The land’s @ITShabbos@it[-year] shall be etc.@p3 Even though I forbade it for you, I did not forbid it for eating or deriving benefit, but [rather] that you shall not treat it as an owner [does], but all shall be equal in it, you and your hired hand and your resident sojourner. @d1The land’s @BIShabbos@BO for you .<TIE>.<TIE>. for food.@p3 From that which has been “rested” [=<TS>declared ownerless] you may eat, [but] you may not eat from that which is kept. @d1For you, your servant and your maidservant.@p3 Since it is said, “and let the needy among your people eat it,” perhaps they [=<TS>the crops] should be forbidden to be eaten by the wealthy? The verse says: “for you, your servant and your maidservant” — behold, the owners, the slaves and maidservants [are all] mentioned here. @d1For your hired hand and your resident sojourner —@p3 even the non-Jews. @p17@p2<EN>[Also] for your domesticated animals and for the [wild] beasts.@p3 If a [wild] beast may eat, certainly a domesticated animal, since your are obligated to feed it. Why does the verse say: “and for your domesticated animals”? It compares a domesticated animal to a [wild] beast: As long as a beast can eat from the field, [you may] feed your domesticated animal from [produce stored] in the house; [when the produce] is gone from the field, put at an end (that stored) for your domesticated animal [removing it] from the house. @p18@p2<EN>Sabbatical years,@p3 seven sabbatical-periods of years. Perhaps he shall declare seven consecutive years [as] sabbatical years, and declare the jubilee after them? The verse says: @d1 Seven years seven times —@p3 say: each @ITshemittoh@it [comes] in its time. @d1And it shall be for you the days of the seven [sabbaths of years], etc.@p3 [This verse] tells you that even if you did not declare sabbatical years, declare the jubilee at the end of forty-nine years. And the plain sense of the verse is: Let the count of sabbatical cycles add up to the number forty-nine. @p19@p2<EN>You shall make a proclamation,@p3 an expression [similar to that of] “they proclaimed throughout the encampment,” an expression of “proclaiming.”@d1 On Yom Kippur,@p3 since it is said, “on Yom Kippur,” do I not know that it is on the tenth of the month? If so, why was it said, @d1On the tenth day of the seventh month@p3? Rather, to tell you [that] blowing [the @ITshofor@it] on the tenth of the month supersedes the Shabbos in all your land, [but] the blowing [of the @ITshofor@it] of Rosh Hashanah does not supersede the Shabbos in all your land, but [only] at the @ITBeis Din@it alone. @p110@p2<EN>You shall sanctify,@p3 when [the jubilee] begins they sanctify it in @ITBeis Din,@it and say: “The year is sanctified.” @d1And proclaim freedom@p3 to slaves, whether [one whose ear has been] pierced or whether [one who] has not completed six years [of servitude], since he was sold. R. Yehudoh said: What [does the] expression @ITderor@it [mean]? As one [=<TS>a free man] who dwells at an inn, etc. who may dwell wherever he wishes, and is not under the control of others. @d1It shall be a jubilee.@p3 This year is separate from the other years in being given a special name for it alone, and what is its name? Its name is “jubilee,” referring to the blowing of the @ITshofor@it. @d1Each man shall return to his ancestral land,@p3 [because] the fields return to their [original] owners. @d1And each man shall return to his family,@p3 to include one who[se ear has been] pierced. @p111@p2<EN>A jubilee, the year of the fiftieth year.@p3 What does the verse mean? Since it is said, “And you shall sanctify [the fiftieth year],” etc. as it is [stated] in Rosh Hashanah and Toras Kohanim. @d1The [grapes of] its untended vineyard,@p3 the grapes which have been kept [by you], but you may gather from those that have been declared ownerless. Just as this is said in regard to the sabbatical year, so it is said in regard to the jubilee. The result is that two holy years are next to one another, the forty-ninth year [is] the sabbatical year, and the fiftieth year is the jubilee. @p112@p2<EN>It shall be holy to you —@p3 its sanctity attaches its worth as Temple property [does]. Perhaps it becomes common food? The verse says: @d1“It shall be” —@p3 it [retains] its [essential character]. @d1[Whatever is] in the field, you may eat [of its produce].@p3 By means of [crops] in the field you eat from the [produce stored] in the house, for if [the crops] of the field have ended for the beast, you have to remove [crops stored] from the house. Just as it was said in regard to the seventh [year], so is it said regarding jubilee. @p113@p2<EN>Each man shall return to his ancestral land.@p3 Was it not already said: “Each man shall return to his ancestral land”? Rather, this [comes] to include one who sells his field and his son arises and redeems it, that it returns to his father in the jubilee. @p114@p2<EN>If you sell, etc.@p3 Its meaning is according to its plain sense. There is also a midrashic exposition: From where [do we know] that when you sell, [you should] sell to your fellow-Jew? The verse says: @d1When you sell anything — @bo sell @BOto your neighbor.@p3 And from where [do we know] that if you come to buy, [you should] buy from your fellow Jew? The verse says: @d1Or purchase — from your neighbor.@p3 @d1Do not cheat —@p3 this refers to cheating in monetary matters. @p115@p2<EN>According to the number of years after the jubilee you shall purchase.@p3 This is its plain sense, to explain the verse properly: It comes to forbid cheating: when you sell or buy land, you must know how many years there are until the jubilee, and according to the years [remaining] and the crops which the field is fit to yield, the seller should sell and the buyer — buy. For [the buyer] is destined to return it to him (the seller) in the jubilee year. And if there are [only] a few years [remaining], and this one sells it for a high price, the result is that the buyer has been cheated; [but] if there are many years [remaining], and he consumes many crops from it, behold, the seller is cheated. Therefore, [the buyer] must buy it according to the time [remaining before the jubilee], and this is what is said, “According to the number of produce years, he shall sell it to you” — according to the number of years of crops which it is to remain in the possession of the buyer, you should sell it to him. And our Rabbis expounded from here that one who sells his field may not redeem it in less than two years, [in order] that it should remain two years — from date to date — in the possession of the buyer. Even if there are three crops in those two years, as, for example, if he sold it to him while [the grain] was standing [in the field]. And [the word] “years” does not depart from its plain meaning, [for the verse means] to say, the number of years of crops and not of drought. And the minimum of “years” — is two. @p116@p2<EN>You shall increase its purchase price,@p3 sell it at a high price. @d1You shall decrease its purchase price,@p3 lessen its price. @p117@p2<EN>You shall not cheat one another.@p3 Here [the verse] forbids annoying others with words, that he should not annoy his fellow-Jew, not offer advice which is not appropriate to him [but] is in accordance with the plan and [for the] benefit of the advisor. And if you say: “Who knows if I had evil intentions”? For that reason it is said: @d1You shall fear your God —@p3 He Who knows [men’s] thoughts, @ITHe@it knows! [Regarding] anything which is a matter of conscience, known only to the person involved, it is said: “You shall fear your God.” @p118@p2<EN>You will then live in the land in security.@p3 For, by the sin of [neglecting] the sabbatical year Israel is exiled, as it is said, “The land will then be appeased for its Shabbosos.<TIE>.<TIE>. and be appeased for its Shabbosos.” The seventy years of the Babylonian exile correspond [as punishment] for seventy sabbatical years which they abolished. @p119@p2<EN>The land will give forth, etc. and you will live securely on it.@p3 You need not worry about a drought year. @d1And eat your fill,@p3 there will be blessing even within your stomach. @p120@p2<EN>Nor gathered [our produce]@p3 into the house. @d1Our produce,@p3 such as wine, fruit from trees, and crops which grow on their own. @p121@p2<EN>For three years,@p3 for part of the sixth, from Nisan until Rosh Hashanah and the seventh and eighth [years], since they would sow in the eighth during Marcheshvon, and harvest in [the following] Nisan. @p122@p2<EN>Until the ninth year,@p3 until the festival of Sukkos of the ninth [year], which is the season of bringing the crop of the eighth [year] into the house. [That is,] since [during] all the days of summer [the crops] were in the fields in the granaries, and Tishrei is the season of gathering into the house. At times, [the crops] would have to last four years — the sixth before the sabbatical year, [which is] the seventh, during which they refrain from working the land for two consecutive years, the seventh and the jubilee year. [However,] this verse was said regarding all other sabbatical cycles. @p123@p2<EN>The land shall not be sold —@p3 to place a prohibition regarding the [buyer’s refusal to] return the fields to their [original] owners during the jubilee — [in order that] the buyer should not withhold it. @d1In perpetuity,@p3 for cutting off [ownership from the original owner], in a sale which severs [the field] forever. @d1For the land is Mine.@p3 Do not begrudge it, for it is not yours. @p124@p2<EN>In all your ancestral lands,@p3 [this comes] to include houses [and] a Hebrew slave; and this matter is explained in [Tractate] Kiddushin, in the first chapter. And according to its plain meaning, [this verse is placed] adjacent to the following section, [in order to introduce the law that] one who sells his landed property may redeem it after two years — either he or his relative — and the buyer may not impede [it]. @p125@p2<EN>If your brother becomes impoverished and sells.@p3 [This] teaches [us] that a person is not permitted to sell his field except under the pressure of poverty. @d1Some of his ancestral land —@p3 and not all of it; [this verse] teaches [us] proper behavior: that he should leave over some of his field for himself. @d1And redeems that which his brother sold —@p3 and the buyer cannot impede [it]. @p126@p2<EN>[Or] if the man has no redeemer.@p3 Is there a person in Israel who has no redeemers? Rather, [the verse means that he has no] redeemer who can redeem the sale. @p127@p2<EN>He shall calculate the number of years,@p3 [that is:] “How many years are there until the jubilee?” “So many and so many.” “And for how much have I sold it to you?” “So much and so much.” “You would have had to return it [to me] at the jubilee; the result is [that you actually] bought a number of crops at a set price for each year. You have consumed it for three years or four [years]; deduct that amount from the purchase-price, and take the rest [as your redemption].” [And this is the meaning of] @d1and return the remainder (excess)@p3 of the purchase price over [the value of] the crops he consumed, and give them to the buyer. @d1To the man to whom he had sold it,@p3 this [original] seller who comes to redeem it. @p128@p2<EN>Enough to retrieve [the land] to himself —@p3 from here [we learn] that he may not redeem it by halves. @d1Until the jubilee year,@p3 that it not enter into that year at all, for the jubilee releases from its beginning. @p129@p2<EN>A residential home within a walled city,@p3 a house that is within a city surrounded by a wall from the days of Yehoshua bin Nun. @d1The time allotted for its redemption shall be.@p3 Since it was said regarding a field, that he could redeem it after two years [from its date of sale] and onward — whenever he wants, but within the first two years he cannot redeem it, it was necessary to specify regarding this [=<TS>houses] that [the law] is reversed, that if he wants to redeem during the first year, he may redeem it, [but] after that he may not redeem it. @d1The time allotted for its redemption shall be@p3 [referring to] the house. @d1Days,@p3 the days of a full year are called “days,” and so too: “Let the girl abide with us a year.” @p130@p2<EN>The house shall remain@bo@BO.<TIE>.<TIE>.in perpetuity,@d2 leaving the control of the seller and remaining under the control of the buyer. @d1That is surrounded by a wall —@p3 we read [the word @ITlo’@it as if it were written @ITlo@it], “to it.” Our Rabbis, may their memory be for a blessing, said: Even though it has none now, since it had one previously, [this rule applies]. And [the word] @ITir@it, “city,” is feminine, and it was [really] necessary to write @ITloh@it “to it,” but since it was necessary to write @ITlo’@it, [“not,] in the text, it was arranged as @ITlo@it, “to him,” in the Scribal Tradition, [as] a play on words. @d1It is not released by the jubilee.@p3 Said R. Safra: If the jubilee occurred during that year, it shall not go out [of the buyer’s possession]. @p131@p2<EN>The houses of open cities,@p3 as its Targum, “open cities,” [i.e.,] open cities without a wall, and many [such cities] are [mentioned] in the Book of Yehoshua, “the cities and their open villages,” “in their open villages and their fortified strongholds.” @d1Shall be considered as a field of the land.@p3 Behold, they are like fields, [which are] redeemable until the jubilee, and return to their [former] owners at the jubilee if they were not redeemed [before the jubilee]. @d1It shall have a redemption —@p3 immediately, if he [so] wishes, and in this [respect] its (a house’s) privilege [of redemption] is greater than [that of] fields, for fields cannot be redeemed until two years [have passed from the time of sale]. @d1And it is released by the jubilee,@p3 without cost. @p132@p2<EN>The cities of the Levites,@p3 [the] forty-eight cities which were given to them. @d1Eternal right of redemption.@p3 He may redeem immediately, even before two years, if they sold one of their fields [which] were given to them within two thousand @ITamohs@it around their cities. Or if they sold a house in a walled city, they may redeem them forever, and it is not irredeemably [in the possession of the buyer] at the end of year. @p133@p2<EN>If anyone redeems from the Levites,@p3 [that is,] if one buys a house or a city from them, that sale of a house or city goes out in jubilee, and returns to the Levite who sold it. and it is not irredeemably [in the possession of the buyer] as are other houses in an Israelite walled city. This “redemption” is an expression of “selling.” Another interpretation: Since it is said: “The Levites shall have an eternal right of redemption,” perhaps the verse speaks only of an Israelite who buys a house in the Levitic cities, but a Levite who buys from a[nother] Levite, [the sale] should be irredeemable? The verse says: “If anyone redeems from the Levites” — even one (=<TS>a Levite) who redeems (=<TS>buys) from a Levite [the seller has the right] of eternal redemption. @d1Then the house .<TIE>.<TIE>. shall be released,@p3 behold, this is another @ITmitzvoh@it (=<TS>@IThalochoh@it), [that is,] if he does not redeem it, it goes out in the jubilee [but] is not irredeemable at the end of a year, as is the house of an Israelite. @d1For the houses of the Levitic cities are [considered] their ancestral lands.@p3 They did not have the inheritance of fields and vineyards, but only cities in which to dwell and their pasturelands, therefore, they (these cities) are for them in place of fields, and they have [a rule] of redemption like fields, so that their inheritance should not be removed from them. @p134@p2<EN>The fields at the outskirts of their cities may not be sold —@p3 a sale by the Temple-treasurer, for if a Levite dedicated his field and did not redeem it, and the Temple-treasurer sold it, it does not go out to the @ITkohanim@it during the jubilee, as it is said regarding [the field of] an Israelite, “and if he sells the field to another person, it shall no longer be redeemable.” But a Levite may redeem it forever. @p135@p2<EN>You must support him.@p3 Do not allow him to decline [socially and financially] and fall [altogether], [so that] it will be difficult to restore him [to his original position], but strengthen him from the time of his weakness. To what may this be compared? To a burden on a donkey: while it is still on the donkey, one [person] may grab hold of it and hold up [the load]; [but if] it (=<TS>the donkey) falls to the ground, five cannot raise it (=<TS>the load) up. @d1The proselyte and the sojourner,@p3 even if he is a proselyte or [a non-Jewish] sojourner. And what is a “sojourner”? Whoever accepts upon himself [the obligation] not to worship idols, and he [may] eat @ITneveilos@it carcasses. @p136@p2<EN>Interest or usury.@p3 The Rabbis equated the two [terms]; [why then does the verse use both? So that one who gives or takes interest] violates two prohibitions. @d1And you shall fear your God.@p3 Because a person’s desire is attracted to [the idea of] usury, it is difficult to separate him from it; for he persuades himself that it is permissible because of his money which is idle in his (=<TS>the borrower’s) possession. [Therefore] it was necessary to say “you shall fear your God.” Or [he may try to circumvent the prohibition] by pretending [that] the money is a non-Jew’s in order to lend them to a Jew with interest, behold, this matter is given over to a man’s heart and thought, and it was therefore necessary to say “You shall fear your God.” @p138@p2<EN>Who brought you out.@p3 And [there] I distinguished between a first-born and one who was not first-born, so [too] I know and will exact punishment from one who lends money to an Israelite with interest and claims that they are a non-Jew’s. Another interpretation: Since I took you out of the land of Egypt — in order that you accept My @ITmitzvos@it upon yourselves, even if they are difficult for you. @d1To give you the land of Canaan,@p3 as a reward for accepting My @ITmitzvos@it. @d1To be a God for you.@p3 For whoever dwells in the land of Israel — I am a God for him; [but] whoever departs from it, is as one who worships idols. @p139@p2<EN>Work him like a slave.@p3 Demeaning work through which he is recognized as a slave — that he not carry his [the master’s] clothes after him to the bathhouse, [or] that he not put on his shoes for him. @p140@p2<EN>Like a hired hand or resident [worker],@p3 agricultural work and skilled work. Treat him like other hired hands. @d1Until the jubilee year.@p3 If the jubilee [year] occured before the six years [of his servitude], the jubilee frees him. @p141@p2<EN>He and his children with him.@p3 Said R. Shimon: If he was sold, who sold his children? Rather, from here [we learn] that this master is obligated to feed his (=<TS>the slave’s) children. @d1To his ancestral estate,@p3 to the honor[ed estate] of his ancestors, and [other people] may not mock him for this. @d1Estate, @p3holding. @p142@p2<EN>For they are My servants —@p3 [and] My decree has precedence. @d1They shall not be sold [in the market] as slaves —@p3 by public announcement: “Here is a slave for sale!” And they must not stand him on the auction block. @p143@p2<EN>You must not rule over him to crush him,@p3 unnecessary labor, in order to torment him. Do not say to him: “Warm this glass for me,” while not needing it; “Hoe beneath this vine until I come.” Perhaps you think that there is no one who can tell whether [the work] is necessary or not, and I will tell him (the slave) that it is necessary? Behold, this thing is given over to his (the master’s) heart, and therefore it is said: “and you shall fear [your God].” @p144@p2<EN>Your slaves and maidservants that you shall possess.@p3 If you say: “If so, by whom shall I be served? I may not rule over my [Jewish] slaves, I may not take possession of [slaves from] the nations, for behold, you have warned me, ’You shall not allow any soul to live [among the Seven Nations],’ then who shall serve me?” @d1From the nations —@p3 they will be slaves for you. @d1That surround you,@p3 [but] not [those] which are within the boundaries of your land, for about those I have [already] said: “You shall not allow any soul to live.” @p145@p2<EN>From the children of the sojourners,@p3 who have come from around you to marry wives in your land, and [if] they have children, the child follows the father[’s national identity], and is not [included] in the prohibition “you shall not allow to live.” However, you @ITare@it allowed to buy him as a slave. @d1You may purchase [slaves].@p3 Them you may buy. @p146@p2<EN>You shall will them as inheritance to your children.@p3 Hold them as possession for your children’s needs after you. It is not possible to explain [the phrase to mean]: “Leave them as an inheritance for your children,” for if so, it should have written: “and you shall leave them as an inheritance for your children.” [The word] @hh<HEB>וְהִתְנַחַלְתֶּם@ee<ENG> is like @hh<HEB>וְהִתְחַזַקְתֶּם@ee<ENG>, [“you shall hold on to them].” @d1Man over his brother.@p3 [This seemingly redundant phrase comes] to include a prince over his people, and a king over his servants, that he should not rule over them to crush them. @p147@p2<EN>If a foreigner or sojourner acquires means.@p3 A foreigner who is a sojourner, as its Targum: “an uncircumcised sojourner,” and the end [of the verse] proves [Targum’s interpretation]: “And he is sold to a foreign sojourner.” @d1If a foreigner or sojourner acquires means.@p3 What caused him to become wealthy? His connection with you. @d1While your brother becomes impoverished by him.@p3 What caused him to become impoverished? His connection with him [=<TS>the sojourner], through which he learned from his actions. @d1Foreign family.@p3 This is the non-Jew [himself], and when it says “the offspring [of a foreign family],” this [refers] to one sold to idol worship itself, to be its servitor, not to [worship] the idol itself, but to hew wood and draw water [which are used for worship.] @p148@p2<EN>Redemption shall be his@p3, immediately. Do not leave him [in this servitude] to sink [into idolatrous ways]. @p150@p2<EN>Until the jubilee year.@p3 Since essentially he did not buy him [for any purpose] but to serve him until the jubilee, since he will [in any case] go out in the jubilee, as it is stated below: “He goes out in the jubilee year.” The verse speaks of a non-Jew who is in your power, but nevertheless you must not approach him deviously because this would be a desecration of God’s Name. Instead, when he comes to be redeemed, let him calculate [the amount] carefully. According to amount for each year let the non-Jew deduct from the [redemption] money: If there had been twenty years from the [time] he was sold until the jubilee, and he bought him for twenty @ITmaneh@it, the result is that the non-Jew purchased a year’s work for a @ITmaneh@it. If he (the slave) remained with him for five years, and [now] comes to be redeemed, he should deduct five @ITmaneh@it and the slave should give him fifteen @ITmaneh@it, and this is: @d1His purchase price shall be [proportional] to the number of years,@bo@BO at the rate of the days of a hired hand it shall be with him@p3 — he shall calculate the amount for each and every year, as though he was hired to him for a @ITmaneh@it a year, and he will deduct for him [the amount he had worked off]. @p151@p2<EN>And if there are yet many years —@p3 until the jubilee. @d1Accordingly,@p3 as I have explained. @p153@p2<EN>He shall not rule over him to crush him before your eyes,@p3 that is to say: while you look on. @p154@p2<EN>If he is not redeemed through these means —@p3 he is redeemed through these, [but] he is not redeemed through [the passage of] six [years]. @d1He, along with his children,@p3 the non-Jew is required to feed his children. @p155@p2<EN>For, Bnei Yisroel are My servants —@p3 My decree has precedence. @d1I am Adonoy, your God.@p3 Whoever enslaves them below, it is as though he enslaves them above. @p11@p2<EN>You shall not make idols for yourselves.@p3 [This is] directed against one who is sold to a non-Jew, that he not say “since my master commits sexual crimes, I will do like him [will do the same], since my master worships idols, I will do like him, since my master profanes the Shabbos, I will do like him;” therefore these verses are stated. And these @hh<HEB>פָּרָשִׁיּוֹת@ee<ENG> are also said in order: At first he warned [him] regarding the seventh year, and if he coveted money and was suspected of [trading in] the seventh year, his end will be to sell his moveable property. And that is why [verse 14] was placed adjacent: “When you sell to your neighbor” — (what is written regarding this? “Or purchase from your neighbor”  — something which is acquired from hand to hand) — if he does not repent, his end will be to sell his estate. [If] he [still] does not repent, in the end he sells his house; [if] he does not repent [at this point], in the end he will borrow at interest — all these last are worse than the first. [If] he has still not repented, in the end he sells himself; [if] he does not repent, not only will he sell himself to a Jew, but even to a non-Jew. @d1And a prostration stone,@p3 [an expression denoting] covering, as [in the verse] “I will cover [you] with My hand.” [This means] they cover the ground with a stone floor. @d1Upon which to prostrate oneself,@p3 even to Heaven, because [prostration involves] the spreading out of hands and feet, and the Torah forbade doing so outside the Temple. @p12@p2<EN>I am Adonoy,@p3 faithful to give reward.
@p13@p2<EN>If you follow My statutes.@p3 Perhaps [this refers to] the fulfillment of the @ITmitzvos@it? When [the verse] says: “and keep My commandments and you will fulfill them,” behold, the fulfillment of the @ITmitzvos@it is mentioned. How do I interpret [the clause]: “If you follow My statutes”? That you should labor in [studying] Torah. @d1And keep My commandments.@p3 Labor in Torah in order to keep and fulfill, as it is said: “And you shall teach them and take care to fulfill them.” @p14@p2<EN>In their proper time,@p3 at the time that it is not the habit of people to go out [of their houses], as for example on (Tuesday nights —  in old [printings of] Rashi[’s commentary]) on Friday nights. @d1And the tree of the field.@p3 These are non-fruit-bearing trees, [but] they will in the future produce fruit. @p15@p2<EN>Threshing will overtake the grape-harvest.@p3 The [amount of] threshing [to be done] will be so great, [that] you will be occupied with it until [time time of] the grape-harvest, and you will occupy yourselves with the grape-harvest until the time of seed [=<TS>planting]. @d1You will eat your bread to satiation.@p3 Eating a little, [but that small amount] will be blessed in [the eater’s] innards. @p16@p2<EN>I will grant peace.@p3 Perhaps you will say: Behold food and behold drink; but if there is no peace, there is nothing! The verse says after all this: “I will grant peace in the land.” From here [we learn] that peace is equal to all [other blessings], and [so too] it [=<TS>the verse] says: “He makes peace and creates all.” @d1No sword shall pass through your land.@p3 Not only will they not come to war [upon you], but [they will not] even pass through your land from province to province [in order to make war elsewhere]. @p17@p2<EN>Before you by the sword@bo — @p3each before his fellow-soldier’s sword. @p18@p2<EN>Of you will pursue,@p3 of the weak among you, and not [even] the heroes among you. @d1Five.<TIE>.<TIE>.one hundred.<TIE>.<TIE>. one hundred of you.<TIE>.<TIE>.ten thousand.@p3 Is this thus the proportion? After all, it was only necessary to state: “a hundred of you will pursue @ITtwo@it thousand”? Rather, [this comes to tell us] that there is no comparison between a few who perform the Torah[’s commandments] and the many who perform the Torah[’s commandments]. @d1Your enemies will fall before you [by the sword].@p3 They will fall before you — not in a natural way. @p19@p2<EN>I will turn to you.@p3 I will turn [my attention] from all My affairs [in order] to pay your reward. A parable. To what may this be compared? To a king who hired workers, etc., as it is in Toras Kohanim. @d1Make you fruitful,@p3 with increasing population. @d1And multiply you,@p3 with an upright stature. @d1And establish My covenant with you — @p3a new covenant, not like the first covenant [at Sinai] which you violated, but a new covenant which will not be violated, as it is said: “I will make a covenant with the House of Israel and the House of Judah a new covenant —  not like the first covenant.” @p110@p2<EN>You shall eat old [store] long kept,@p3 the crops will be preserved and of good [quality] to be aged, that the old [store] long kept of three years [ago] will be better to eat than that of last year! @d1And old [store] you will have to clear out because of the new — @p3that the threshing floors will be full of new [crops], and the storehouses [will be] full of old [store long kept], and you will need to empty the storehouses, [taking the old crops] to another place, [in order] to place new [crops] within. @p111@p2<EN>I will set My sanctuary,@p3 this is the Temple. @d1And My spirit will not loathe (reject) you,@p3 My spirit will not abhor you. Every expression of @hh<HEB>גְעִילָה@ee<ENG> is an expression of expelling a substance absorbed in something, similar [to]: “for there the shield of the mighty was repelled,” [meaning] that it did not accept the oiling for they would oil their leather shields with boiled fat, in order that an arrow’s or [spear’s-blow] would slip off, so as not to pierce the skin [of the shield]. @p112@p2<EN>I will walk among you,@p3 I will stroll with you in the Garden of Eden as one of you, and you will not be frightened of Me. Perhaps [this means that] you will not fear Me? The verse says: @d1I will be a God for you.@p3 @p113@p2<EN>I am Adonoy your God.@p3 I am worthy that you should believe in Me, that I can do all these [things], for behold, I have taken you out of the land of Egypt, and I performed great miracles for you. @d1Bars [of your yoke].@p3 [This is] like a peg at the two ends of the yoke which impede the strap from slipping off the head of the ox, [which would cause] the knot to become untied. Similar to “Make straps and bars for yourself.” @ITCheville@it in Old French. @d1Standing upright,@p3 [with] upright stature. @p114@p2<EN>And if you will not listen to Me@p3 to labor [in the study of] Torah, to know the expositions of the Sages. Perhaps [this refers to] the performance of the @ITmitzvos@it? When [the verse] says: @d1and you will not fulfill etc.,@p3 behold, the performance of the @ITmitzvos@it is mentioned, how then do I interpret “and if you will not listen to Me”? To labor [in the study of] Torah. And why does the verse say “to Me”? the word @hh<HEB>לִי@ee<ENG> [in this chapter of punishments] refers to [the sins of] one who acknowledges his Master and intentionally rebels against Him, and so regarding Nimrod, “He was a mighty hunter before Adonoy,” he acknowledged Him and intentionally rebelled against Him, and so regarding the people of Sedom, [“The people of Sedom were] wicked and sinful towards Adonoy, exceedingly,” they acknowledged their Master and intentionally rebelled against Him. @d1And you will not fulfill,@p3 since you will not learn, you will not fulfill — resulting in two sins. @p115@p2<EN>If you despise My statutes,@p3 despise others who do perform [My statutes]. @d1Your souls loathe My laws,@p3 you hate the Sages. @d1Not to fulfill — @p3preventing others from fulfilling [the @ITmitzvos@it]. @d1All My commandments,@p3 he denies that I commanded them, and that is why it is said: “all @ITMy@it @ITmitzvos@it,” and not “all @ITthe@it @ITmitzvos@it.” @d1Thereby breaking My covenant,@p3 denying the Essential Principle. Behold, seven sins, the first causing the second, and so until the seventh. And these are: He did not learn, and did not perform [the @ITmitzvos@it], despises others who do perform, hates the Sages, prevents others [from performing], denies the @ITmitzvos@it, denies the Essential Principle. @p116@p2<EN>I will impose on you,@p3 and I will command against you. @d1Swelling,@p3 a sickness which causes the flesh to swell, @ITampoules@it in Old French, similar to a swollen [person] whose swelling has subsided, and the appearance of his face is washed out. @d1Fever,@p3 a sickness which inflames the body, makes it hot and burning, as [in the verse]: “For My anger has kindled a fire.” @d1That consume the eyes and fill the soul with grief.@p3 The eyes peer out expectantly and pine to see that [the sick person] should improve and be healed, [but] in the end he is not healed, and his family’s souls are grief-stricken at his death. Any desire which is not fulfilled, or any hope that is deferred, is called “consumption of the eyes.” @d1You will plant [your seeds] in vain,@p3 you sow [but] it does not grow, and if it grows, @d1your enemies will consume [your crops].@p3 @p117@p2<EN>I will set My Face against you — @p3My attention — I will turn from all My affairs to do you harm. @d1Your foes will rule over you.@p3 According to its plain sense, [the word @ITrodu@it means] “they will rule over you.” The Aggodo of Toras Kohanim of this @ITparashoh@it:@d1 (16) Then I will do the same with you.@p3 I speak only with anger. So too [the verse]: “I too will deal with them contrarily.” @d1I will impose upon you,@p3 that these blows will visit you one after another, while the first is still visited upon you, I will bring another, and join it to [the first]. @d1Terror,@p3 A blow which frightens people, and what is that? This is a deathly plague. @d1Swelling.@p3 Some people, though they are ill and bedridden, their flesh is still whole, [and so] the verse says: “swelling” — that [the flesh] is swollen. Or at times it [=<TS>the flesh] is swollen, but the sick person is comfortable and not feverish, [and so] the verse says: “and fever” — teaching that he is feverish. Or at times he is feverish, but he himself feels that he will live. The verse says: “consume the eyes.” Or he himself does not feel that he will live, but others feel that he will live — the verse says: “fill the soul with grief.” @d1You will plant your seed in vain.@p3 He sows it and it does not grow; what then do your enemies come [to] eat? The verse says: @d1Your enemies will consume it.@p3 How is this? He sows it the first year and it does not grow; [he sows it] the second year, and it grows, [but] the enemies come and find the crop [and take it] for the days of siege, [while] those within [the besieged city] die of starvation, since they did not gather the crop the year before. Another interpretation: “You will plant your seed in vain”: In reference to sons and daughters does the verse speak; that you labor for them and raise them, and sin (the enemy) comes and puts an end to them, as it is said: “Those that I have swaddled and brought up my enemy has consumed.” @d1(17) I will set My face against you.@p3 As it is said regarding the good, “and I will turn to you,” so is it said regarding evil, “I will set My Face.” They [=<TS>the Sages] proposed a parable; [this may be compared] to a king who said to his servants: “I am turning from all my affairs, and am concerning myself only with you — for evil.” @d1You will be defeated before your enemies,@p3 The plague will kill you within [your cities], [while] your enemies will surround you without. @d1Your foes will rule over you.@p3 I do not set up enemies for you but from you and within you. For while the nations of the world stand against Israel, they seek only that which is in the open, as it is said: “And when Israel would sow, Midyon and Amolek and the Easterners would attack, etc., they camped against them, and destroyed the produce of the land.” But when I set up against you [enemies] from you and within you, they seek your [hidden] treasures, and so [the verse] says: “Who also eat the flesh of My people, and flay their skin from off them.” @d1And you will flee,@p3 because of panic. @d1When no one is pursuing you,@p3 because of lack of strength. @p118@p2<EN>If after these,@p3 and if after these [have happened], @d1you [still] do not listen [to Me], then I will increase@p3 still other sufferings. @d1Sevenfold, as your sins,@p3 seven punishments for the seven sins mentioned above. @p119@p2<EN>I will break the pride of your power,@p3 this [refers to] the Temple, and so too [the verse] says: “Behold, I will profane My Sanctuary, the pride of your strength.” @d1I will make your heavens like iron, and your land like copper.@p3 This is more severe than Moshe[’s curse], for there [the verse] says: “And your heavens which are over your head are copper, etc.” that the heavens will exude moisture just as copper exudes moisture, and the earth will not exude moisture just as iron does not exude moisture, and [therefore] it keeps its produce [from rotting], but here the heavens will not exude moisture just as iron does not exude moisture, and there will be drought in the world. [Moreover,] the land will exude moisture just as copper exudes moisture, and [thus] destroys its produce. @p120@p2<EN>Your strength will be exhausted in vain.@p3 Behold, a person who does not labor, who does not plow, who does not sow, who does not weed, nor clears the thorns, nor hoes, but at harvest time a blight comes and strikes it, it does not matter [to him]. But a person who labors, and plows and sows and weeds and clears the thorns and hoes, and blight comes and strikes [the crop], behold the teeth of such a one are set on edge. @d1Your land will not yield its produce,@p3 even what you bring to it at the time of seeding. @d1And the tree[s] of the land.@p3 even from the very earth a curse will be upon them. Its fruit will not blossom at the time of blossoming. @d1Will not give forth.@p3 [This phrase] serves both above and below — for “tree” and for “produce.” @d1Will not give forth its produce,@p3 and when it does produce fruits, it casts them off; thus there are two curses [in this phrase] and there are here [therefore] seven curses [in all]. @p121@p2<EN>If you walk contrary to Me.@p3 Our Rabbis said [that the word @ITkeri@it means] “irregularly,” “by chance,” [something occurring] only occasionally — so [here]: if you will follow the @ITmitzvos@it [only] occasionally. And Menachem explained [it as] an expression of “withholding,” and similarly [the verse]: “Withhold your foot [from your neighbor’s house,” and similarly, “a [person of] restrained spirit.” This [interpretation] is close to its Targumic [translation] of Onkelos, [which is] an expression of hardness, “for they harden their hearts, refraining from approaching Me.” @d1Sevenfold, as your sins,@p3 seven other punishments, in the number seven, as your sins [number seven]. @p122@p2<EN>I will send,@p3 an expression of inciting. @d1Will make you bereft of children.@p3 I [find mention only of] wild beasts which cause bereavement, whose nature is such [to attack humans,] however domesticated animals whose nature is not such, how do I know [that they will rob them of children]. The verse says: “The teeth of domesticated animals I will set upon them.” [Thus we have] two [punishments]. And how [do we know] that it will kill with its bite? The verse says: “With the poison of serpents of the dust.” Just as these [=<TS>the serpents] bite and kill, so too these [will] bite and kill. There were indeed years in Eretz Yisroel [in which] a donkey bit and killed, [and] a wild ass bit and killed. @d1Will make you bereft of children — @p3 these are minors. @d1Destroy your cattle,@p3 from without. @d1And reduce you[r population],@p3 within. @d1Make your roads into wasteland.@p3 [This refers to] major roads and secondary roads. Thus there are seven punishments: “teeth of domesticated animals,” “teeth of wild animals,” “the anger (=<TS>poison) of those who slither in the dust,” “and make bereft,” “cut off (=<TS>decimate),” “and reduce [population],” “and become desolate.” @p123@p2<EN>You have not been disciplined@p3 to return to Me. @p125@p2<EN>Avenging the covenant.@p3 There is “avenging” (@ITnokom@it) which is not for the [violation of the] covenant, [such as those] as are usual with other “avengings,” [as for example] the blinding of Tzidkiyohu. Another interpretation: @d1Avenging the covenant — @p3 avenging My covenant which you have transgressed. Every [mention] in Tanach of bringing a sword [refers to] battle of enemy armies. @d1You will huddle@bo@BO [in your cities],@p3 from the outside into the midst of the cities because of the siege. @d1I will send pestilence among you,@p3 [and] by means of pestilence, @d1you will be given [into the hand of the enemy],@p3 [into the hands] of the enemies who besiege you. Since [it is not permitted] to allow a dead body to remain overnight in Jerusalem, when they take out the dead body to bury it, they are given into the hand of the enemy. @p126@p2<EN>Staff of your bread,@p3 an expression of “support,” similar to “strong staff.” @d1When I break the staff of your bread,@p3 I will break for you every support of food. These are the “arrows of famine.” @d1Ten women will bake your bread in one oven,@p3 for lack of wood. @d1And they will return your bread by weight.@p3 For the crops will have been rotted, and the bread is [therefore] crumbly, breaking in the oven. They (the women) sit and weigh the pieces to divide them among themselves. @d1You will eat but you will not be satisfied.@p3 This is a curse of the bread within the stomach. Thus there are seven punishments: “sword,” “siege,” “pestilence,” “the breaking of the staff of bread,” “lack of wood,” “crumbly bread,” “curse in the stomach.” “And you will be given [into the hand of the enemy”] is not of that number, [for] it is [the same as] “the sword.” @p130@p2<EN>High places,@p3 towers and castles. @d1sun images,@p3 a type of idolatrous worship which they set up on roofs, and because they set them up in the sun they are called “sun images.” @d1I will set your corpses.@p3 [People] were [once] swollen from starvation, and would take their idols from their bosoms, and would kiss them; each person’s belly would split open, and he would fall [dead] upon it [the idol]. @d1My soul will loathe you.@p3 This [refers] to the departure of the @ITShechinoh.@it @p131@p2<EN>I will turn your cities into ruins.@p3 Perhaps [this means they will be uninhabited] by man? When [the verse] says: “I will make the land desolate,” [the curse of cities empty of] mankind is mentioned. How [then] do I interpret “ruins” [in our verse]? [Empty of even] passersby. @d1And bring your Sanctuaries into desolation.@p3 Perhaps [this means that they will be empty] of sacrifices? When [the verse] says: “I shall no longer scent [accept favorably the fragrance of your offerings],” sacrifices are mentioned. How [then] do I interpret “and bring your sanctuaries into desolation”? [They will be empty of] bands of pilgrims — caravans of Israel[ites] who would sanctify themselves and gather together to come there. Thus there are seven punishments: eating the flesh of sons and daughters and the destruction of the high places — these make two, [since] the cutting down of sun images is not a punishment, but rather [this means that] by means of the destruction of the towers the sun images at the top of the roofs fall and are cut off, “and I will set your corpses,” etc., this makes three, the departure of the @ITShechinoh@it [makes] four, the destruction of cities, the desertion of the Sanctuary by bands of pilgrims, “and I shall no longer scent your offerings” — making seven [in all]. @p132@p2<EN>I will make the land [so] desolate.@p3 This is [actually] a kindly measure for Israel, for their enemies will not find any satisfaction in their land, for it will be desolate of its inhabitants. @p133@p2<EN>I will scatter you among the nations.@p3 This is a harsh measure, for when the inhabitants of a province go into exile to one place, they see each other and are comforted, [but] Israel is scattered as by a winnowing fan, as when a person winnows barley with a fan, and no one of [the barley grains] clings to the next. @d1Unsheath.@p3 When [a soldier] unsheates [his] sword, the scabbard is emptied. And its midrashic [explanation]: A sword once drawn in your [pursuit] does not quickly return [to its scabbard], as a person who empties his water [from its container] — it does not quickly return [to the container]. @d1Your land will be desolate,@p3 [and] you will not quickly return to its midst, and thus @BOyour cities will be in ruins — @bo they will seem desolate [even] to you, for when a person is exiled from his house, from his vineyard and his city, [but] is destined to return, it is as though his house and vineyard are not in ruins. So it is taught in @ITToras Kohanim@it. @p134@p2<EN>[The land] will then be appeased,@p3 it will appease the wrath of God, Who was angry regarding [the neglect of] sabbatical years. @d1Will be appeased — @bofor the King — @BOits sabbatical years.@p3 @p135@p2<EN>(All the days that it lies desolate,@p3 a passive construction [=<TS>“being made desolate”], and the @ITmem@it has a @hh<HEB>דָגֵּשׁ@ee<ENG> in place of the doubled [@ITmem@it] [in the word] @ITshemomoh@it.) @d1The rest it did not have on your Shabbosos.@p3 The seventy years of the Babylonian exile correspond to the seventy years of sabbatical years and jubilees [which were neglected], and [thus] were years during which Israel angered God in their land — four hundred and thirty years. Three hundred and ninety were the years of their sin, from [the time] they entered the land until the Ten Tribes went into exile. and the inhabitants of Yehudoh angered Him forty years from [the time] the Ten Tribes went into exile until the destruction of Yerusholayim — as it is said in [the Book of] Yechezkel: “Lie on your left side, etc. [When] you complete these, you will lie on your right side [again]” — forty days” —  “you will bear the iniquity of the House of Judah.” This prophecy was said to Yechezkel in the fifth year of the exile of King Yehoyochin, and they lasted yet another six years until the exile of King Tzidkiyohu —  which yields [the number] 46. And if you say Menasheh’s years were fifty-five, [I would answer] Menasheh repented for thirty-three years, and all the years of his wickedness were twenty-two, — as they (=<TS>the Rabbis) said in the @ITAggodoh@it of @ITChelek@it — and [those] of Amon: two, eleven for Yehoyokim, and similarly for Tzidkiyohu. Go calculate for 436 years the [number of] sabbatical years and jubilees contained in them, they [number] 16 [years] per century — 14 sabbatical years and 2 jubilees — resulting in 64 [years] for four centuries, [and] for 36 years [we have] five sabbatical years — [the total] is seventy minus one. [There is] yet another year, for [this 436-year period] ended with a sabbatical year, which completes the seventy. And on them (=<TS>the Israelites) was decreed [an exile] of seventy complete years, and so [the verse] says in Divrei Hayomim, “until the land had paid her sabbaths, etc. to fufill her seventy years.” @p136@p2<EN>I will send timidity — @p3panic and faint-heartedness. The @ITmem@it of @hh<HEB>מרֶךְ@ee<ENG> is a formative letter which falls away, like the @ITm@it@ITem@it of @hh<HEB>מוֹעֵד@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>מוֹקֵשׁ@ee<ENG> . @d1And they will flee as though fleeing from a sword.@p3 As though the pursuers were killing them. @d1A blown leaf,@p3 which the wind pushes and it beats against another leaf, so that, in tapping it, it rustles. And so is its Targum: “the sound of a leaf beating.” (An expression of beating, “beaten by an east wind,” [the word @hh<HEB>שַׁקִיף@ee<ENG>] is an expression of @ITmashkof@it, “lintel,” the place [against which] the door beats.) And so the Targum of @hh<HEB>חֲבּוּרָה@ee<ENG>, “a wound,” @ITmashkofei@it, “[a spot which has been] beaten.” @p137@p2<EN>They will stumble over one another,@p3 when they rush to flee [the enemy], they will stumble into one another, for they will be panic-stricken as they run. @d1As though before a sword.@p3 As though they are fleeing before killers — that their hearts will be in a panic, and at every moment they think that a person is pursuing them. And its midrashic explanation is: “They will stumble over one another” — one by the sin of the other, since all Israel is responsible for one another. @p138@p2<EN>You will be lost among the nations.@p3 When you will be scattered you will be lost from one another. @d1[The land of your enemies] will consume you — @p3[this refers to] those who will die in exile. @p139@p2<EN>The iniquities of their ancestors which are [still] with them — @p3when the sins of their ancestors are with them, when they hold onto the deeds of their ancestors. @d1Will they rot away.@p3 An expression of “melting,” similar to “they shall melt away.” And like it [is the verse]: “[Their eyes] shall melt away in their sockets,” “My wounds melt.” @p141@p2<EN>And [I will] bring them,@p3 I Myself will bring them; this is a good measure for Israel, that they should not say: “Since we have been exiled among the nations, we will do as they do.” I will not allow them [to do this], but I will establish My prophets, and bring them beneath My shelter, as it is said: “And that which comes into your mind shall not be at all, [that you say, ’We will be as the nations, as the families of the lands, to serve wood and stone’]. As I live, [says the Lord God,] surely with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with fury poured out, will I be king over you, etc.” @d1Or perhaps then [their uncircumcised heart] will be humbled.@p3 As: “If it was known that it was a goring ox” — if then they will be humbled. Another interpretation: “Perhaps then their hearts will be humbled, etc.” @d1And then their iniquities will be appeased.@p3 They will atone for their iniquities with their sufferings. @p142@p2<EN>I will remember My covenant with Yaakov.@p3 In five places [the name Yaakov] is written “full,” and [the name of the prophet] Eliyohu [is spelled] “defectively” in five places. Yaakov took a letter from the name of Eliyohu [as a] pledge, that he [=<TS>Eliyohu] should come and announce the redemption of his children. @d1I will remember My covenant with Yaakov.@p3 Why are they [=<TS>the Patriarchs] listed in reverse order? So as to say: The youngest, Yaakov, [alone] is worthy of that; and if he is not worthy, behold, Yitzchok is with him, and if he is not worthy, behold, Avrohom is with him, and he is worthy. And why is “remembrance” not said [in connection] with Yitzchok? Because Yitzchok’s ashes are visible before Me, [as though] they are heaped up and lying on the altar. @p143@p2<EN>Since what certainly caused [this] is that.@p3 [As] retribution and in retribution, in that “they despised My laws.” @p144@p2<EN>All this notwithstanding,@p3 and even if I bring about this punishment for you which I have stated, [nevertheless,] @d1even when they are in the land of their enemies,@p3 I will not despise them, [in order] to put an end to them, and to violate My covenant with them. @p145@p2<EN>The covenant of their ancestors@bo@BO — @p3of the tribes. @p146@p2<EN>And the teachings,@p3 one in written form and one in oral form. [This] tells [us] that both of them were given to Moshe at Sinai. @p12@p2<EN>When a person expresses — @p3he specifies orally. @d1Pledging valuation of souls,@p3 to give the worth of souls, [that is,] to say: “The worth of something on which the soul depends is incumbent upon me.” @p13@p2<EN>The valuation.<TIE>.<TIE>.shall, etc.@p3 This [word] @hh<HEB>עֵרֶךְ@ee<ENG> does not denote “money,” but rather, whether he is worth much or little — “according to his years” — that is the worth set for him in this @ITparoshoh@it. [The word @hh<HEB>עֶרְכְּךָ@ee<ENG>,] @d1valuation@p3 is like @hh<HEB>עֵרֶךְ@ee<ENG> , and as to the doubling of the @ITkof@it, I do not know from which grammatical form it is [derived]. @p15@p2<EN>If from five years of age.@p3 Not that the one vowing is a minor, for the words of a minor have no legal force, but [rather this refers to the case in which] an adult says: “The valuation of this minor, who is five years old, is incumbent upon me.” @p17@p2<EN>If from sixty and above, etc.@p3 When one reaches the years of old age, a woman is considered close [in economic value] to a man; (therefore, a man in growing old loses more than a third of his value, [while] a woman loses [just] a third of her value.), As people say, “An old man in the house — a snare in the house; an old woman in the house — a treasure in the house, and a good sign in the house.” @p18@p2<EN>And if he is [too] poor,@p3 that he cannot afford to give this valuation. @d1He shall set him — @p3the one whose value is being assessed [shall be set] before the @ITkohein@it, and he (=<TS>the @ITkohein@it) shall assess his value according to the means of the one pledging the assessment. @d1According to the means,@p3 he should assess him according to his means, and should leave him enough to live on: a bed, mattress and cushion, and the tools of his trade. If he is donkey driver, he leaves him his donkey. @p19@p2<EN>Any of it that he will give.@p3 [If] he said: “The foot of this [animal] is a burnt-offering,” his statement is binding, and it must be sold for the needs of a burnt-offering, [but] its sale price is [considered] common [=<TS>non-holy] except for the price of that limb. @p110@p2<EN>Whether it be a good one for a worse one,@p3 an [as yet undedicated] unblemished [animal] for [an already dedicated] one which has a blemish. @d1[Or] a bad one for a better one,@p3 and certainly [the exchange of] good for good or bad for bad [is forbidden]. @p111@p2<EN>If it is any unclean animal.@p3 The verse speaks of a blemished [animal], which is “unclean” as far as offering it is concerned. The verse teaches you that unblemished sanctified [animals] do not become unsanctified by redemption unless they have become blemished. @p112@p2<EN>As the @BIkohein@BO determines its value for you, so shall it be,@p3 for other people who come to buy it from Temple property. @p113@p2<EN>If he will indeed redeem it,@p3 The verse is more stringent in regard to the owners, [requiring] the addition of a fifth, and so [too] regarding one who consecrates a house, and so [too] one who consecrates a field, and so [too] regarding the redemption of second tithe — the owners add a fifth, [but] not other people [who come to redeem them]. @p116@p2<EN>Its valuation shall be according to the measure of its seed,@p3 not according to its worth. Whether the field is good or bad, the redemption of which was dedicated is the same: an area fit for a @hh<HEB>כּוֹר@ee<ENG> of barley seed for fifty @ITshekolim@it. Such is the Torah’s decree, and that applies to one who comes to redeem it at the beginning of the jubilee [cycle], [or] if he comes to redeem it in the middle [of a cycle], he pays according to the proportion of a @hh<HEB>סֶלַע@ee<ENG> and a @hh<HEB>פּוּנְדְּיוֹן@ee<ENG> per year. Because it is only consecrated for the number of years in a jubilee [cycle]: if it is redeemed [by the owner], fine; if not, the [Temple] treasurer sells it for this price to another, and it remains in the hands of the buyer until the jubilee, like other fields which are sold. And when it leaves his (=<TS>the buyer’s) possession, it returns to the @ITkohanim@it of that priestly-watch in which the jubilee [year] occurs, and is divided among them. This is the law stated regarding one who consecrated a field, and now I will explain it in the order of the verses. @p117@p2<EN>If immediately after the jubilee year he consecrates [his field], etc.@p3 If when the jubilee year passes, he immediately consecrated it, and this one comes to redeem it immediately. @d1It shall be established according to its valuation,@p3 according to this assessment mentioned shall it be: he shall give fifty @ITshekolim@it [for the entire jubilee cycle]. @p118@p2<EN>If after the jubilee he consecrates his field.@p3 And so [too] if he consecrated it from the time of the jubilee and it remains in the possession of the [Temple] treasurer, and this one comes to redeem it after the jubilee — @d1then the @BIkohein@BO shall calculate the money [due] according to the remaining years,@p3 according to the proportion. How is this? Note that [the verse] set the price for forty-nine years [at] fifty @ITshekolim@it, yielding a @ITshekel@it per year, and an additional @ITshekel@it for all of them. A shekel is forty-eight pundionim resulting in a @hh<HEB>סֶלַע@ee<ENG> [=<TS>shekel] and a @hh<HEB>פּוּנְדְּיוֹן@ee<ENG> per year, except that one @hh<HEB>פּוּנְדְּיוֹן@ee<ENG> is missing for all of them. Our Rabbis stated that the [missing] @hh<HEB>פּוּנְדְּיוֹן@ee<ENG> is a commission for money changing. [Therefore,] one who comes to redeem [the field] gives a @hh<HEB>סֶלַע@ee<ENG> [=<TS>@ITshekel@it] and a @hh<HEB>פּוּנְדְּיוֹן@ee<ENG> for each year of the remaining years until the jubilee year. @d1And its valuation shall be reduced accordingly.@p3 [That is, according] to the number of years that are from the jubilee year until the year of redemption. @p119@p2<EN>And if he will redeem — @p3[if] the one who dedicated it [redeems it], he should add a fifth over this amount. @p120@p2<EN>And if he does not redeem the field@bo — @p3the one who dedicated [it] @d1and if he — @bothe Temple treasurer — @BOsells@bo @d1[sells] the field to another person, it shall no longer be redeemable,@p3 to return to the possession of he who dedicated [it]. @p121@p2<EN>When the field is released by the jubilee,@p3 from the possession of the one who bought it from the Temple treasurer, in the manner of other fields which leave their buyer’s possession in the jubilee. @d1It becomes sacred to Adonoy.@p3 Not that it returns to the Temple treasury, for Temple upkeep, to the control of the Temple treasurer, but @d1just as a field that was consecrated,@p3 which is given to the @ITkohanim@it, as it is said: “Every consecration in Israel shall be yours,” this too must be divided among the @ITkohanim@it of that priestly watch in which Yom Kippur of the Jubilee falls. @p122@p2<EN>If it is a field that he purchased, etc.@p3 There is a distinction between a field purchased and a field inherited, for, a field purchased is not divided by the @ITkohanim@it in the jubilee, since [the one who consecrates] it can consecrate it only until the jubilee, since in the jubilee it is destined to leave his possession and return to its [original] owners. Therefore, if he comes to redeem it, he must redeem it for this price, set down for an ancestral field. And whether he does not redeem it, and the treasurer sells it to someone else, or he does redeem it —  @p124@p2<EN>On the jubilee year the field shall revert to him from whom it was purchased — @p3[i.e., to him from whom] he that had consecrated it (had bought it). And lest you say “to him from whom it was purchased” [refers to] this last buyer [who bought it] from him, and that is the [Temple] treasurer, it was therefore necessary to say @d1“to him whose ancestral land it was” — @p3 [meaning,] from an ancestral inheritance —  and this is the original owner who sold it to the one who consecrated [it]. @p125@p2<EN>All of your valuations shall be in holy @BIshekolim.@p3 Every valuation, regarding which @ITshekolim@it are mentioned, must be in holy @ITshekolim@it. @d1Twenty @BIgeirah,@p3 twenty @ITmo’oh@it. Such were they at first, but afterwards they added a sixth. Our Rabbis stated: [There are] six silver @ITmo’oh@it to the @ITdinar@it, twenty-four @ITmo’oh@it to the @ITsela’@it [=<TS>a @ITshekel@it]. @p126@p2<EN>A man shall not consecrate it,@p3 for the sake of any other sacrifice, because it is not his. @p127@p2<EN>If it is of an unclean animal, etc.@p3 This verse does not refer to a firstling, for it cannot be said of a firstling of an unclean animal “he shall redeem it based on the valuation.” [Furthermore,] this [cannot] be a donkey, for the redemption of a first-born donkey is a lamb, which is a gift to the @ITkohein@it, and does not [go] to the Temple treasury. Rather, the verse refers to [consecrations to] the Temple [treasury,] for the verse above speaks of the redemption of a [ritually] clean animal which became blemished, and here it speaks of one who consecrates a [ritually] unclean animal to the Temple upkeep. @d1He shall redeem it based on the valuation,@p3 according to what the @ITkohein@it shall assess it[s worth]. @d1If it is not redeemed@p3 by the owners, @d1it shall be sold@p3 — to others. @p128@p2<EN>However, any dedications, etc.@p3 Our Rabbis were in disagreement over the matter. Some say that unspecified consecrations belong to the Temple treasury. How do I [then] interpret [the verse]: “Every consecration in Israel shall be yours”? This refers to dedications [made explicitly for the] @ITkohanim@it, where [the one who dedicated it] said clearly: “Behold, this is a dedication for the @ITkohein@it.” And some say: unspecified dedications [go to] the @ITkohein@it. @d1[None of these] can be sold or redeemed,@p3 but must be given to the @ITKohein@it. According to the opinion of the one who says: “Unspecified dedications belong to the @ITKohein@it,” this verse is explained as [referring] to unspecified dedications, and [according to] the one who says: “Unspecified dedications belong to the Temple upkeep,” this verse is explained as [referring] to dedications [explicitly dedicated] to @ITkohanim@it, for all admit that dedications [dedicated] to @ITkohanim@it cannot be redeemed, until they come to the hand of the @ITkohein@it, [while] dedications [dedicated] to the Highest may be redeemed. @d1Everything that is dedicated is most holy.@p3 The one who says unspecified dedications belong to the Temple upkeep, brings proof from here, and the one who says [that] unspecified dedications belong to the @ITkohanim@it explains [that the sentence], “Everything that is dedicated is most holy,” teaches that dedications to @ITkohanim@it apply to sacrifices that are most holy [as well] as to sacrifices of lesser degree. He gives [them] to the @ITkohein@it, as we learned in Maseches Arochin: If a vow, he gives their worth, [and] if a voluntary offering, he gives the worth of its benefit. @d1Be it people.@p3 As for example, [if] he dedicated his [Canaanite] slaves or his Canaanite maidservants. @p129@p2<EN>Any dedication that a man will dedicate,@p3 If a person is going to be executed and [some]one[, on seeing him,] said: “His worth is on me” — he has said nothing. @d1He shall surely be put to death,@p3 behold, he is going to die, [and] therefore he cannot be redeemed; he has no worth, and no [vowable] value. @p130@p2<EN>All tithings of the land — @p3the verse speaks of second tithe. @d1The seed [crops] of the land — @p3of grain. @d1Of the fruit of the tree — @p3wine and oil. @d1Belongs to Adonoy,@p3 God has taken possession of it, and it is from His table that He has commanded you to go up and eat in Jerusalem, as it is said, “And you shall eat before Adonoy your God, the tithe of your grain, your wine,” etc. @p131@p2<EN>Of his tithe — @p3but not of the tithe of his fellow-Jew. One who redeems the [second] tithe of his fellow-Jew, does not add a fifth. And what is its redemption? He redeems it in order to permit [its] consumption in any place, and he brings up the coins [of its redemption/sale] and eats [the food bought with them] in Jerusalem, as it is said, “Then you shall lay out in money,” etc. @p132@p2<EN>Under the rod,@p3 when he comes to tithe them, he makes them pass out through the gateway one after another, and the tenth [one] he strikes with a rod smeared with red dye, [so that] it can be recognized [as being of] the tithe. So does he do to the young lamb and calves of each year. @d1Shall be sacred to Adonoy,@p3 to be brought to the altar, its blood and innards, and the flesh is eaten by the owners, since it is not counted with other gifts of the priesthood, and we have not found that its flesh should be given to the @ITkohanim@it. @p133@p2<EN>He shall not make a distinction, etc.@p3 Since it is said: “And all your choice vows,” perhaps he should select and bring out the nicest? The verse says: “He shall not make a distinction between better or worse [animals]” — holiness descends on it whether it is whole or blemished; not that it may be brought [when] blemished, but it may be eaten under the law of tithing, and it is [thusly] forbidden to be shorn or worked.
