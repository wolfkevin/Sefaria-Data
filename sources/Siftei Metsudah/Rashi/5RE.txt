@p11@p2<EN>These are the words.@p3 @rr°@bbBecause these are words of admonishment, and [because] he [Moshe] intended to recount here all the places where they [the Israelites] angered the Almighty,<QC>
he therefore said these words in an obscure manner @rr°@bband only intimated [that they sinned in these places] to uphold the honor of Israel. @d1To all of Yisroel.@d2 Had he admonished [only] some of them, those that were in the market place could have said, “You heard what the son of Amram said [about us] and did not refute him about anything; had we been there we would have refuted [his charges].” Therefore, he gathered all of them, and said to them, “You are all present here, he who can refute [me], let him refute [me]. @d1In the wilderness.@d2 They were not in the wilderness but in the plains of Moav. What then is the meaning of @hh<HEB>בַּמִּדְבָּר@ee<ENG>? It is mentioned here because @rr°@bbthey had angered God in the wilderness when they said “If only we had died [by the hand of Adonoy,] etc.”<QC>
@d1In the Arava plain.@d2 @rr°@bbBecause it was at Arava that they had sinned through Baal Peor at Shittim in the plains of Moav. @d1Facing Suf.@d2 Because they had rebelled at the Reed Sea — when they came to the Reed Sea, they said “were there not enough graves in Egypt.” And similarly when they went up from the midst of the sea, as it is said, “But they rebelled at the Sea, at the Sea of Reeds,” as it is taught in Maseches Eruchin. @d1Between Poron and Tofel and Lovon.@d2 R. Shimon ben Yochai said, “We reviewed the entire Scripture and we found no place with the name Tofel or Lovon. Rather he admonished them [with these words] @rr°@bbregarding the denigrating statements they made (@ITTofel@it) about the Manna which is white (@ITLovon@it), when they said, “Our soul detests this light bread.” [The word @ITPoron@it implies] @rr°@bbthe sin they committed in the wilderness of @ITPoron@it because of the spies. @d1And Chatzeiros.@d2 @rr°@bbThis refers to the rebellion of Korach. Another explanation — He said to them, “You should have learned [a lesson] @rr°@bbfrom what I did to Miriam at Chatzeiros because of the slander she spoke, @rr°@bband nevertheless you spoke against the Almighty. @d1And Di Zohov.@d2 He admonished them about the [golden] calf they made because of the abundance of gold they had [accumulated], as it is said, “I gave them silver and gold in abundance, they made it into a @ITBaal@it [an idol].”<QC>
@p12@p2<EN>Eleven days [travelling time] from Choreiv.@p3 Moshe said to them, “See what you brought on yourselves, there is no shorter route from Choreiv to Kadeish Barnea than by way of Mount Seir, and even that is a journey of eleven days; and [yet] you covered the distance in three days.” For you travelled from Choreiv on the twentieth of Iyar, as it is said, “In the second year, in the second month, on the twentieth day of the month [the cloud went up and the Bnei Yisroel journeyed out of the wilderness of Sinai, Choreiv], and on the twenty-ninth day of Sivan they sent the spies from Kodeish-Barnea. @rr°@bbDeduct from these days the thirty days they lived in Kivros haTaavah where they ate the meat for a month of days; [and deduct] the seven days they camped at Chatzeiros waiting for Miriam who was closed up there; thus we find that in three days, they travelled that entire route. To this extent @rr°@bbthe @ITShechina@it attempted for your good to hasten your coming to the Land, but because of your misconduct, He made you @rr°@bbcircle around Mount Seir for forty years. @p13@p2<EN>[Beginning] in the fortieth year in the eleventh month, on the first of the month.@p3 This teaches that he admonished them @rr°@bbonly shortly before his death. From whom did he learn this? From Yaakov — For Yaakov admonished his sons only shortly before his death. He said, “Reuvein, my son, I will tell you why I did not admonish you during all these years; because I did not want you to desert me and go to join my brother Eisov.” There are four reasons why one would not admonish a person until shortly before one’s death: 1) @rr°@bbso that he does not admonish him again and again, 2) @rr°@bbso that his fellow not be ashamed when he sees him, etc., as it is taught in Sifre. Similarly, Yehoshua admonished the Bnei Yisroel only shortly before his death, and so Shmuel, as it is said, “Behold testify against me,” and so Dovid admonished his son Shlomo, [shortly before his death.] @p14@p2<EN>After he had smitten [Sichon].@p3 Moshe said, “If @rr°@bbI admonish them before they come into [at least] part of the land, they could say, “What claim does he have on us? What good has he done for us? He has come only to harass us and @rr°@bbto find an excuse [for leaving us in the wilderness], for he has no power to bring us into the land.” Therefore he waited until he crushed Sichon and Og before them and had given them possession of their land, and then he admonished them. @d1Sichon, [King of the Emorites] who was living in Cheshbon.@p3 @rr°@bbEven if Sichon was not a formidable opponent but had lived in Cheshbon, it would have been difficult [to defeat him] because the city itself was formidable; and if it would have been another city and Sichon had lived there, it would have been difficult [to defeat him] because the King [Sichon] was a formidable opponent. How much more [difficult was the situation] when both King and city were formidable [opponents.] @d1[Og] who was living in Ashtoros, in Edrei.@d2 [Here too] the King and the city were formidable [opponents.] @d1Ashtoros.@d2 This is an expression denoting cliffs and ruggedness of terrain @rr°@bbsimilar to Ashteros Karnayim, @rr°@bband this Ashtoros is indeed the same Ashteros Karnayim where the Rephaim were when Amrofel smote them, as it is said, “and they defeated the Rephaim in Ashteros Karnayim.” Og was the only one who escaped from them, and he is referred to in the verse as it is said, “the one who escaped came [and told Avram], and it is stated, “Only Og, King of Bashan remained of the remnant of the Rephaim.” @d1In Edrei.@d2 @rr°@bbThis was the name of the empire. @p15@p2<EN>[Moshe] began.@p3 @rr°@bb[The word @hh<HEB>הוֹאִיל@ee<ENG> means] he began; just as it is [said,] “Here I have begun [to speak].” @d1To elucidate this Torah.@d2 He explained it to them @rr°@bbin seventy languages.<QC>
@p16@p2<EN>Enough of your living [at this mountain].@p3 @rr°@bbAccording to its plain meaning [it refers to the extended length of time]; @rr°@bbbut there is an Aggadic interpretation: You have received much fame and reward as a result of your having dwelt on this mountain — you constructed the @ITMishkan,@it the @ITMenorah@it and [various other sacred] articles, you received the Torah, you appointed a @ITSanhedrin@it for yourselves, officers in charge of hundreds and officers of thousands. @p17@p2<EN>Turn and Travel for yourselves.@p3 This was the route through Arad and Chormah. @d1And arrive at the Emorite hill [region].@d2 Understand this literally. @d1And at all its neighbors.@d2 @rr°@bbThis refers to Ammon, and Moav, and Mount Seir.<QC>
@d1On the plain.@d2 This refers to plain of the forest. @d1On the mountain.@d2 The King’s mountain. @d1And in the low land.@d2 This refers to the low land of the south[ern region]. @d1And in the Negev, and on the seacoast.@d2 Ashkelon, Gaza, and Caesarea, etc. as is stated in Siphrei. @d1Up to the great River [the Euphrates].@d2 Because it is mentioned in connection to Eretz Yisroel, @rr°@bbit is referred to as great. There is a proverb that says, The servant of the King is a King; @rr°@bbattach yourself to the chief and people will bow to you; @rr°@bbbecome close to one who is anointed [distinguished] and you become anointed. @p18@p2<EN>See I have set.@p3 You see this with your own eyes. I am not saying this to you based on guesswork or rumor. @d1Come and inherit [the land].@d2 @rr°@bbNo one will contest this matter, and you will not need to go to war. Had they not sent spies, they would have had no need for weapons. @d1To your forefathers.@d2 What need was there to mention [them by Name] Avrohom, Yitzchok and Yaakov? [To teach that the merit of] Avrohom alone was sufficient, [the merit of] Yitzchok alone was sufficient, [the merit of] of Yaakov alone was sufficient. @p19@p2<EN>I said to you at that time saying.@p3 @rr°@bbWhat is the significance of @hh<HEB>לֵאמֹר@ee<ENG> in this context? Moshe said to them, @rr°@bb”I am not telling you this on my own initiative, but at the behest of the Holy One, blessed is He.” @d1I cannot [carry you] by myself.@d2 @rr°@bbIs it possible that Moshe was unable to judge [Bnei] Yisroel? The man who brought them out of Egypt, who split the sea for them, who caused the Manna to fall, who piled up the quails, @rr°@bbwas unable to judge them? However, this is what he said to them, “Adonoy, your God, has @rr°@bbmultiplied you, i.e., he has made you great and has uplifted you over your judges; He has removed the penalty from you @rr°@bband set it upon judges. Shlomo intimated the same thing when he said, “For who is able to judge this difficult people of Yours.” Is it possible that he of whom it is written, @rr°@bb”He is the wisest of all men,” should say, “Who is able to judge, etc.”; but this is actually what Shlomo said [meant], the judges of this people are not like the judges of the nations of the world, for when they [wrongly] judge a person, send to death, or whipping, or strangulation, or if they pervert his justice and rob him, it is not considered a serious matter, but if I wrongly sentence a person to pay money I am liable for my very life, as it is said, “And He robs the life of those who rob them.” @p110@p2<EN>And you are today like the stars in the sky.@p3 Were they really numerous as the stars that day? They actually numbered only six hundred thousand [at the time]. @rr°@bbWhat then does “@ITyou are today@it” mean? You are compared to the day, you are as eternal as the sun, the moon and the stars. @p111@p2<EN>[He] will add to you one thousandfold.@p3 What is the significance of the additional words: @d1And will bless you as He spoke about you?@d2 They [Bnei Yisroel] said to Moshe, “You are limiting our blessing, the Holy One blessed is He, has already assured Avrohom, “[I will make your descendants as the dust of the earth] so that if a man can count, etc.” @rr°@bb[Moshe then] said to them, “This [one thousandfold blessing] is my personal blessing, but He will bless you “As He spoke about you.” @p112@p2<EN>How can I carry alone.@p3 If I would say, [“I will do so] @rr°@bbin order to be rewarded,” I cannot do so. This is what I have [already] told you, “I did not say this to you on my own accord but by the order of the Holy One Blessed is He.” @d1Your troublesomeness.@d2 This teaches us that Bnei Yisroel were troublesome. If one of them would see that his rival was about to win the Din Torah, he would say, “I have [additional] witnesses to bring, I have [more] proof to bring, I want to add additional judges over you.” @d1Your burdensomeness.@d2 @rr°@bbThis teaches that they were scoffers. When Moshe left his tent early [in the morning], they would say, “Why does the son of Amram leave so early? Perhaps things are not calm in his house”? When he left late, they would say, “For what reason is the son of Amram not leaving? What do you think [is the reason]? He is sitting and planning evil schemes against you, and is thinking up plots [against you].” @d1Contentiousness.@d2 This teaches that they were discontented. @p113@p2<EN>Provide yourselves [men]@p3 @rr°@bbPrepare yourselves to fulfil this matter. @d1Men.@d2 Would you think [that he expected them to take] women [as leaders]? Why then was it necessary to stipulate “men”? [To emphasize that they should be] @rr°@bbrighteous men,<QC>
@rr°@bbMen who are desired. @d1Wise men. @d1Understanding.@d2 Men who are able to deduce one matter on the basis of another matter. This is what Arius asked R’ Yosi, “What is the difference between wise men and understanding men”? A wise man is like a wealthy currency dealer, when people bring him @ITdinarim@it to evaluate, he evaluates them; and when they do not bring to him, he sits and is idle. An understanding man is like a commercial trader, when they bring him coins to evaluate, he evaluates them; and when they do not bring to him, @rr°@bbhe goes about to bring his own. @d1And renowned to your tribes.@d2 those that are known to you, for if he would come before me @rr°@bbenwrapped in his @ITtalis,@it I would not know who he is, and from which tribe he comes, and if he is qualified; but you know him, for you have raised him. Therefore it is said, “And renowned to your tribes.” @d1Leaders over you.@d2 Leaders and men of honor over you, that you will conduct yourselves with them with respect and reverence. @d1And designated them.@d2 @rr°@bbThe word @hh<HEB>אַשִׂמֵם@ee<ENG> lacks the letter @ITyud@it (our @ITsifrei Torah@it however have the @ITyud@it in place). This teaches that the guilt of Bnei Yisroel is placed on the heads of their judges (leaders) for it is their duty to admonish and direct them onto the right path.<QC>
@p114@p2<EN>And you answered me [and said].@p3 @rr°@bbYou answered with determination to your benefit. You should have replied, “Moshe, our teacher, from whom is it more fitting to learn, from you or from your disciple? Would it not be better [to learn] from you who suffered for it?” But I knew your thoughts when you said, now many judges will be appointed over us, if he is not of our acquaintance, we will bring him a present (bribe), and he will deal favorably with us. @d1To do.@d2 [Even] if I had been sluggish [in doing so], you [would have] said “Do it quickly.”<QC>
@p115@p2<EN>I took the leaders of your tribes.@p3 @rr°@bbI persuaded them with words: Fortunate are you! Over whom are you to be appointed? Over the children of Avrohom, Yitzchok and Yaakov, over those who are called [by the Almighty] [His] bretheren, friends, [His] portion, inheritance, and by every expression of affection. @d1Men wise and renowned.@d2 But men of understanding I did not find. @rr°@bbThis qualification was one of the seven requirements which Yisro outlined to Moshe. [Moshe] found only three of them: righteous men, wise men, and men of renown. @d1Leaders over You.@d2 You must show them respect: [they must be given] first to buy, first chance to sell, first chance in business dealings; @rr°@bbhe is to enter [the Synagogue or Bais Hamidrash] last and he is to be first to leave.<QC>
@d1Masters of thousands.@d2 One who is appointed [to govern] over one thousand. @d1Master of hundreds.@d2 One who is appointed [to govern] over one hundered. @d1Court-officers.@d2 @rr°@bbI appointed court-officers for your tribes. These jail and flog the offender by order of judges. @p116@p2<EN>I commanded your judges.@p3 I said to them, @rr°@bb”Act with patience in judging. If certain litigation is brought before you once, twice and three times, do not say ‘this litigation has already been before me many times,’ but deliberate the case thoroughly.”<QC>
@d1At that time.@d2 When I appointed them, I said to them, “The situation now is no longer as it was. @rr°@bbIn the past you were on your own, [but] now you are obligated to the community.” @d1Listen.@d2 @hh<HEB>שָׁמֹעַ@ee<ENG> is a grammatical form denoting present active, @ITodant@it in Old French, similar to @hh<HEB>זָכוֹר@ee<ENG> remember, and @hh<HEB>שָׁמוֹר@ee<ENG> preserve. @d1And between his complainant.@d2 This refers to his complainant in a litigation @rr°@bbwho accumulates words against him. Another explanation — between his co-dweller — even refers to a dispute concerning a dwelling such as the division of a house between brothers, @rr°@bbeven [a dispute] about an oven and a range.<QC>
@p117@p2<EN>Do not show favor in judgement.@p3 @rr°@bbThis [command is addressed] to the one who appoints judges, he should not say, “This person is handsome or powerful, I will appoint him to be a judge; this person is my relative, I will appoint him to be a judge in the city,” and since this person is not an expert in the laws, consequently, he will convict the innocent, and acquit the guilty. I will consider it against the one who appointed him as though he showed favor in judgement. @d1Small and great alike will you hear out.@d2 @rr°@bbLitigation involving a @ITperuta@it should be as dear to you as litigation involving a hundred @ITmaneh,@it @rr°@bbso if a [minor litigation] comes before you first, do not push it off until the last. @rr°@bbAnother explanation: Small and great alike will you hear out, can be explained as the @ITTargum Onkelos@it has it: [hear out the words of the small as well as the great person,] i.e., he should not say, “This one is a poor man, and his friend [opponent] is a rich man and since he is commanded to support him, I will rule in favor of the poor man and thus he will be supported in a tidy manner.” Another explanation: He should not say, “How can I offend the dignity of this rich man because of one @ITdinar?@it I will rule in his favor for the moment, and when he goes outside [the court] I will say to him ‘give it back to him because you [really] owe it to him.”’ @d1Do not fear any man.@d2 @rr°@bbDo not be afraid. Another explanation of @hh<HEB>לֹא תָגוּרוּ@ee<ENG>: @rr°@bbDo not gather in [suppress] your words because of man. @hh<HEB>תָגוּרוּ@ee<ENG> is an expression similar to @hh<HEB>אוֹגֵר בְּקַיִץ@ee<ENG> — Gathering in the summer. @d1For justice belongs to God.@d2 Whatever you take from this man unjustly, you force Me to restore to him. The result being @rr°@bbthat you diverted the judgement upon Me. @d1Present to me.@d2 @rr°@bbBecause of this [statement] the law eluded him regarding the daughters of Tselofchod. Similarly, when Shmuel said to Shaul, “I am the Seer [prophet],” the Holy One Blessed is He said to him, “By your life! I will inform you that you are not a Seer [prophet].” When did He inform him? When he (Shmuel) came to anoint Dovid [it is written] “And when he saw Eliav, he said, ‘Surely before Adonoy stands His anointed.’ The Holy One blessed is He, said to him (Shmuel), “Did you not say ‘I am the Seer,’ do not look at the physical appearance.” @p118@p2<EN>All the things that you are to do.@p3 This refers to the ten things that differentiate @rr°@bbbetween monetary litigations and capital litigations.<QC>
@p119@p2<EN>The Great and awesome wilderness.@p3 [It is so called] because @rr°@bbin there were snakes thick as beams and scorpions large as bows. @p122@p2<EN>You approached me, all of You.@p3 [All of you together] @rr°@bbin a hodgepodge. But later, he [Moshe] said, “You approached me, all the leaders of your tribes and your elders, and you said, ‘Look, etc.”’ that approach was proper — the young people showed respect for the elders, letting them them go ahead of them, and the elders showed respect for the leaders, letting them go ahead of them; but here you approached me, all of you, in a hodgepodge — the young pushing aside the elders, and the elders pushing aside the leaders. @d1And let them bring back word to us.@d2 Let them tell us @rr°@bbwhat language they speak. @d1The route we are to go up on.@d2 @rr°@bbThere is no road in which there are no winding curves.<QC>
@d1And the cities we will be coming to.@d2 @rr°@bb[Which cities] will we have to capture first. @p123@p2<EN>The idea pleased me.@p3 In my eyes [the idea was good] but not in the eyes of the Almighty. If the idea pleased Moshe, why did he mention it among his admonishments? [This can be explained with a] parable. A man says to his fellow, “Sell this donkey of yours to me.” He says, “yes [I will sell it to you].” “Will you give it to me on a trial basis”? He answers, “Yes.” “May I try it out on hills and mountains”? He answers, “Yes.” Since he [the buyer] saw that the seller placed no restrictions [on the sale], the buyer says to himself, “This man is confident that I will find no defect in it.” He then immediately says to him, “Take your money — I need not test it.” [Here too, Moshe said], “I too consented to your words, [thinking] perhaps you would change your minds [when you saw that I did not object, but you did not change your minds.”] @d1I took from you.@d2 @rr°@bbFrom the choicest among you, from the finest among you. @d1Twelve men, one man per tribe.@d2 @rr°@bbThis tells us that the tribe of Levi was not among them. @p124@p2<EN>[They arrived] at Wadi Eshkol.@p3 @rr°@bbThis tells us that it was called [Eshkol] because of the incident that was to happen there. @d1And they spied it out.@d2 This teaches that they passed through it @rr°@bbalong four lines — through its length and breadth. @p125@p2<EN>And brought down to us.@p3 This tells us Eretz Yisroel is higher than all other lands.<QC>
@d1And they said, “Good is the land.”@d2 @rr°@bbWho were they that said [the land was] good? Yehoshua and Caleiv. @p126@p2<EN>And You defied.@p3 @hh<HEB>וַתַּמְרוּ@ee<ENG> is an expression of defiance. You defied His word. @p127@p2<EN>You grumbled.@p3 You spoke slanderous words. This is similar to “the words of a @hh<HEB>נִרְגָן@ee<ENG>,” i.e., a man who slanders. @d1Because of Adonoy’s hatred of us.@d2 In reality, He loved you, but you hated Him. @rr°@bbA popular proverb says, @rr°@bb”What is in your heart regarding your friend, @rr°@bb[you imagine] is in his heart regarding yourself.” @d1Because of Adonoy’s hatred of us, He took us out of the land of Egypt.@d2 @rr°@bbHis taking us out was an act of hatred. This may be compared to a human King who had two sons and two fields, @rr°@bbone of which was well-watered, and the other was dry. To the son he loves he gives the well-watered field, and to the son he hates he gives the dry field. The land of Egypt is a well-watered land, for the Nile river rises and irrigates it, and the land of Canaan is a dry land — and He took us out of Egypt in order to give us the land of Canaan. @p128@p2<EN>Cities great and fortified sky-high.@p3 Scriptual texts [at times] speak in @rr°@bbexaggerated terms.<QC>
@p129@p2<EN>Do not crumble.@p3 @hh<HEB>תַעַרְצוּן@ee<ENG> is an expression of breaking; as the Targum [translates it]; and it is similar to “To abide in @hh<HEB>עָרוּץ נְחָלִים@ee<ENG> — in the cleavage of the valleys.” @p130@p2<EN>He will wage war for you.@p3 On your behalf. @p131@p2<EN>In the wilderness as you have seen.@p3 @rr°@bbThis verse is connected to the previous verse: “As in everything that He did with you in Egypt,” and now also in the wilderness as you have seen how He carried, etc. @d1The way a man carries his son.@d2 [Understand this] just as I explained the verse: “the angel of Elohim moved [from its position] when it travelled in front of the camp of Yisroel, etc.” This can be compared to a person on a journey with his son walking ahead of him, and highwaymen come to kidnap him [the son], etc. @p132@p2<EN>Yet in this matter — @p3 that He promised you to bring you to the Land, you did not trust Him. @p133@p2<EN>To show you [the way].@p3 @rr°@bbThe word @hh<HEB>לַרְאֹתְכֶם@ee<ENG> is the same as @hh<HEB>לְהַרְאֹתְכֶם@ee<ENG>. Similarly, @hh<HEB>הַנְחוֹתָם הַדֶּרֶך@ee<ENG>, [to lead them on the way] is the same as @hh<HEB>לְהַנְחֹתָם@ee<ENG>. Similarly, @hh<HEB>לַשְׁמִיעַ בְּקוֹל תּוֹדָה@ee<ENG>, [to make myself heard in a voice of thanksgiving is the same as @hh<HEB>לְהַשְׁמִיעַ@ee<ENG>.] Similarly, @hh<HEB>לָלֶכֶת לַגִיד בְּיִזְרְאֶל@ee<ENG> [@hh<HEB>לַגִיד@ee<ENG> is the same as @hh<HEB>לְהַגִיד@ee<ENG>] @p136@p2<EN>That he trod upon.@p3 @rr°@bbThis refers to Chevron, as it is said, “And he came to Chevron.” @p137@p2<EN>Was angry.@p3 He was filled with anger. @p140@p2<EN>Turn yourselves [around].@p3 I said [thought] to let you pass across the breadth of the land of Edom, northward, to enter the Land [Eretz Yisroel]; however you sinned and caused this delay for yourselves. @d1Turn yourselves [around].@d2 Turn backwards and travel through the wilderness toward the Reed Sea, for the wilderness through which they were travelling, was south of Mount Seir, separating the Reed Sea and Mount Seir. Now draw back towards the [Reed] Sea and circle around Mount Seir, travelling along its entire southern region from the west to the east. @p141@p2<EN>And you got ready.@p3 @hh<HEB>תָּהִינוּ@ee<ENG> is an expression similar to @hh<HEB>הִנֶנוּ,@ee<ENG> [as in the verse] “Here we are and we will go up to the place.” This is the expression you used, an affirmative expression, @rr°@bbAs if to say, you made yourselves ready [to go up the mountain]. @p142@p2<EN>Do not go up.@p3 @rr°@bbThere will be no going up [victory] for you but only descent [defeat].<QC>
@p144@p2<EN>As the bees do.@p3 Just as this bee @rr°@bbwhen it stings a person, it [the bee] dies immediately; so too when they [the Emorites] touched you, they died immediately. @p145@p2<EN>Adonoy did not accept your prayer.@p3 If this was possible to say of Him — @rr°@bbYou made His attribute of compassion as though it was one of cruelty. @p146@p2<EN>You lived in Kodeish many years.@p3 Nineteen years, as it is said: “like the years you lived [elsewhere]” i.e., during their other travels @rr°@bbwhich totaled thirty-eight years. Nineteen of these years they spent in Kodeish, and nineteen years they drifted about aimlessly, and then they returned to Kodeish, as it is said: “He caused them to wander about in the wilderness.” I found this [explanation] in @ITSeder Olam.@it @p11@p2<EN>We turned and travelled into the wilderness.@p3 @rr°@bbHad they not sinned, they would have travelled by way of Mount Seir to enter the Land from its southern [border] to its northern [border]; but because they sinned they were forced to turn to the wilderness which is between the Reed Sea and the southern edge of Mount Seir. They then travelled along its southern edge moving from west to east. @d1By way of the Reed Sea [route].@d2 @rr°@bbThe route they travelled when leaving Egypt, which is the southwestern tip. From there they travelled eastward. @d1And we circled Mount Seir.@d2 @rr°@bbWe traversed its entire southern rim, until we came to the land of Moav. @p13@p2<EN>Turn yourselves northward.@p3 @rr°@bbTurn yourselves towards the eastern side [of Moav,] from south to north, your faces to the north. Thus they were travelling along the eastern side [of Moav]. This is what is said: “And they came from the east to the land of Moav.” @p14@p2<EN>You must be extremely cautious.@p3 And what is this caution — “Do not incite them.”<QC>
@p15@p2<EN>As much as [lit. until] a footstep.@p3 @rr°@bbEven as much as a footstep, in other words, I do not permit you even as much as a footstep @rr°@bbto pass through their land, unless they grant you permission. A Midrashic explanation: @rr°@bbUntil the day comes when there will be footsteps upon the Mount of Olives, as it is said, ‘And his feet shall stand etc.’<QC>
@d1Eisov’s inheritance.@d2 from Avrohom. I gave (promised) the land of ten nations to him; seven of which will be yours. The lands of the Kainites, Kenizzites and Kadmonites, which are actually Amon, Moav and Seir — One of them belongs to Eisov, And [the other] two to the children of Lot, @rr°@bbas a reward for his going along with him [Avrohom] to Egypt and for remaining silent when they said regarding his wife [Soroh] that she was his sister. He [God] therefore treated him [Lot] like his son. @p16@p2<EN>You are to purchase.@p3 @hh<HEB>תִּכְרוּ@ee<ENG> is an expression indicating purchase. Similarly, ‘I have acquired for myself’; for in the cities on the sea-shore they refer to selling as @hh<HEB>כִּירָה@ee<ENG>. @p17@p2<EN>For Adonoy your God has blessed you.@p3 @rr°@bbTherefore do not show ingratitude by showing yourselves to be poor, but show yourselves to be rich.<QC>
@p18@p2<EN>We turned and passed over.@p3 Northward. @rr°@bbWe turned our faces to travel along the eastern side. @p19@p2<EN>Do not intimidate them [with war].@p3 @rr°@bbThe only thing He forbid them regarding Moav was to engage them in war, @rr°@bbbut they were permitted to terrify them by appearing before them armed for war. That is why it is written: “And Moav was afraid of the people” because they [Yisroel] plundered and ransacked them. However regarding the people of Ammon, it is said, @rr°@bb”Do not intimidate them” in any way. They [Ammon] were rewarded for the modesty shown by their ancestress [Lot’s younger daughter] who did not publicize her father’s act as did his older daughter @rr°@bbwho named her son, Moav [from @ITmy@it father]. @d1Or.@d2 @rr°@bbThe name of the country. @p110@p2<EN>The Eimim originally [lived there].@p3 You might think this is the land of Rephaim @rr°@bbthat I gave to Avrohom because the Eimim who are [actually] Rephaim lived there originally, but this is not that [land] because those Rephaim I drove out in favor of Lot’s descendants, and settled them in their place. @p111@p2<EN>They, too, were considered Rephaim.@p3 Those Eimin were considered Rephaim like the Anokim who were called Rephaim. They were called [Rephaim] because everyone who saw them — their hands became weak (@hh<HEB>רָפָה@ee<ENG>) [from fright]. @d1Eimim.@d2 They were so called because the fear of them (@hh<HEB>אֵימָה@ee<ENG>) was inflicted upon the people. So too: “And in Seir lived the Chorim,” and I gave them into [the hands] of Eisov’s descendants. @p112@p2<EN>Drove them out.@p3 This denotes constancy as if to say: @rr°@bbI gave them the power to enable them to drive them out continuously.<QC>
@p115@p2<EN>Attacked them.@p3 In order to rout them quickly within forty years time so as not to cause their children @rr°@bbto be further delayed in the wilderness. @p116@p2<EN>When they had finished. @p117@p2<EN>Adonoy addressed me.@d2 However, from the time the spies were sent until now, @rr°@bbthe word @hh<HEB>וַיְדַבֵּר@ee<ENG> was not mentioned, only @hh<HEB>וַיֹּאמֶר@ee<ENG> , this was to teach that during the entire thirty-eight years that the Israelites were condemned, the @hh<HEB>דִּבּוּר@ee<ENG> [Divine] word was not uniquely with him as an expression of affection — face to face and with philosophic composure. This teaches that the @ITShechinah,@it the Divine Presence, rests on the prophets only for the sake of Yisroel. @d1The men of war.@d2 Those over twenty years old who were eligible to go to the Army. @p118@p2<EN>You are today crossing the border of Moav. @p119@p2<EN>When you approach [the area] facing the descendants of Ammon.@p3 From this we learn that the land of Ammon was north of Moav.<QC>
@p120@p2<EN>[It, too, is] considered a land of giants.@p3 It is also considered a land of giants because the giants lived there originally, but is still not the land that I gave to Avrohom. @p123@p2<EN>And the Avim who had been living in Chatzeirim.@p3 The Avim were of the Philistines, for they are included with them in the Book of Yehoshua, as it is said, “The five chiefs of the Philistines: the Azosi, the Ashdodi, the Ashkeloni the Giti, the Akroni, and the Avim.” However, because of the oath @rr°@bbthat Avrohom swore to Avimelech, the Bnei Yisroel could not take the land from their possession therefore I brought the Caftorim against them, and they destroyed them and settled there in their stead; and now you are permitted to take it [the land] from their possession. @p125@p2<EN>Under the whole heaven.@p3 @rr°@bbThis teaches that the sun stood still for Moshe on the day of the war against Og, and [the victory] became known under the whole heaven. @p126@p2<EN>From the wilderness of Kedeimos.@p3 @rr°@bbEven though the Almighty did not command me to declare peace to Sichon, I learned to do so from [what happened] in the wilderness of Sinai, from [the giving of] the Torah which preceded @hh<HEB>קָּדְמָה@ee<ENG> [the creation of] the world. When the Holy One Blessed is He, came to give [the Torah to] Bnei Yisroel, He solicited Eisov and Yishmael about it [first]. It was certainly known to Him that they would not accept it but nevertheless He greeted them in peace. Similarly, I too approached Sichon with words of peace. @rr°@bbAnother explanation of “From the wilderness of Kedeimos”: From You I learned — [from You] Who existed before the creation of the world. You could have sent one bolt of lightning to burn up the Egyptians, but You sent me from the wilderness to go to Pharaoh to say to him gently, “Send My people.”<QC>
@p129@p2<EN>As the descendants of Eisov did for me.@p3 @rr°@bbThis does not refer to [our] passing through their land but only regarding their selling food and water.<QC>
@d1Until I will have crossed the Yardein.@d2 @rr°@bbThis refers to the statement, “Let me pass through [your land]. @p131@p2<EN>[See] I have begun defeating before you.@p3 He forced the protecting angel of the Amorites, who was in the upper spheres, [to fall] beneath the feet of Moshe, and caused [Moshe] to stamp on his neck. @p132@p2<EN>And Sichon went out.@p3 @rr°@bbHe did not send for Og to help him; this teaches you that they did not require each others help.<QC>
@p133@p2<EN>And his sons.@p3 @rr°@bbIt (@hh<HEB>בְּנוֹ@ee<ENG>) is written [like a singular-possessive] [which would be translated: @IThis son@it]; for he (Sichon) had a son who was as mighty as himself. @p134@p2<EN>@hh<HEB>מְתִם@ee<ENG>.@p3 means men. Regarding the booty of Sichon it is said, “We plundered for ourselves,” which is an expression of plunder, because it was appealing to them and each man took booty for himself. However when they came to the plundering of Og, they were already satisfied and full, and it was cheap in their eyes; so they ripped up and threw away cattle and clothing and took nothing but silver and gold. Therefore it is said, @hh<HEB>בַּזּוֹנוּ לָנוּ@ee<ENG>, indicating that it was despicable to them. This is how it is expounded in Sifrei, in the chapter, “And Bnei Yisroel dwelt in Shittim.”<QC>
@p137@p2<EN>@HB<HEB>כָּל יַד נַחַל יַבֹּק@ee<ENG>.@p3 @rr°@bbAll along Wadi Yabok.@p3 @d1Everything Adonoy our God [commanded us] — @d2 @rr°@bbnot to capture, we left [uncaptured]. @p11@p2<EN>We turned and went up.@p3 The entire [journey] northward was uphill. @p12@p2<EN>Do not fear him.@p3 Concerning Sichon, it was not necessary to say, “Do not fear him,” [But concerning Og] Moshe was troubled that he not benefit from the merit of having been of service to Avrohom, as it is said, “the one who escaped came,” and that was Og. @p14@p2<EN>The province of Argov. Targum Onkelos translates this: @hh<HEB>בֵּית פָּלָך טְרָכוֹנָא@ee<ENG>,@p3 and I saw that @ITTargum Yerushalmi@it to Megillas Esther calls a palace @hh<HEB>טְרָכוֹנִין@ee<ENG>. @rr°@bbI learned from this that @hh<HEB>חֶבֶל אַרְגֹּב@ee<ENG> refers to the province of the Royal Palace. @rr°@bbIn other words the empire is called after its name. Similarly the word @hh<HEB>אַרְגּוֹב@ee<ENG> is found in [Seifer] Melachim, [in this context:] it was near the Royal Palace that Pekach, son of Remalyahu killed Pekachya, son of Menachem. I learned from this that this was the name of the province.<QC>
@p15@p2<EN>Unwalled cities.@p3 Unconfined and open, without a wall. Similarly, “Jerusalem shall be inhabited like unwalled cities.” @p16@p2<EN>Annihilating.@p3 In the present tense, [as] going and destroying. @p18@p2<EN>From the possession of.@p3 From under the control of. @p19@p2<EN>The Tzidonites call Chermon.@p3 But elsewhere it says “up to Mount Si’on which is Chermon.” Hence, it has four names. Why must they [all] be mentioned? To tell the praise of the Land of Yisroel. Four kings prided themselves in it; One said, “it shall be called in my name,” and another said, “it shall be called in my name.” @d1Sneer.@d2 @rr°@bbThis is snow in German, and in the Canaanite language. @p111@p2<EN>From the remainder of the giants — @p3 that were killed by Amrafel and his allies at Ashteros Karnayim, and he (Og) escaped from the battle, as it is said, “And the one who escaped came,” and that referred to Og. @d1In a man’s @ITamoh.@it@d2 — @rr°@bbthe @ITamoh@it of Og. @p112@p2<EN>And this land.@p3 “This land” refers to the land @rr°@bbmentioned above, “From Wadi Arnon to Mount Chermon.”<QC>
@d1We inherited at that time, from Aroer which is on Wadi Arnon.@d2 This is not to be connected with the first part of the verse but with its conclusion — with “I gave to the Reuvenites and the Gaddites.” However regarding inheritance (possession) that was from [Wadi Arnon] to Mount Chermon.<QC>
@p113@p2<EN>That is called the land of Rephaim.@p3 @rr°@bbThat is the land which I gave to Avrohom. @p116@p2<EN>Within the wadi and the border.@p3 The entire wadi and @rr°@bbuntil its opposite bank. In other words, @hh<HEB>עַד@ee<ENG> means not only until but includes everything within and even more.<QC>
@p117@p2<EN>From Kinneres.@p3 @rr°@bbThis is on the western side of the Yardein. The inheritance of Bnei Gad was on the eastern side of the Yardein and their inheritance included the width of the Yardein adjoining their land, plus [some] land on its opposite side up to Kinneres. this then is what is said here, “And the Yardein and the border,” The Yardein and (some land) on its opposite side. @p118@p2<EN>I commanded you.@p3 @rr°@bbHe was speaking to Bnei Reuvein and Bnei Gad. @d1Ahead of your brothers.@d2 @rr°@bbThey went ahead of Bnei Yisroel in battle because they were mighty warriors, and their enemies fell before them, as it is said, “he rips off the arm, even the head.”<QC>
@p123@p2<EN>I pleaded.@p3 @rr°@bbThe word @hh<HEB>חִנוּן@ee<ENG> everywhere signifies an undeserved gift. Although the righteous might claim [reward] based on their good deeds, they ask the Almighty only for an undeserved gift. @rr°@bbBecause [the Almighty] had said to him, “I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious,” he [Moshe] uses the expression @hh<HEB>וְאֶתְחַנַּן@ee<ENG>. @rr°@bbThere is another explanation: This is one of the ten terms @rr°@bbby which prayer is described, as is stated in Sifrei. @d1At that time.@d2 @rr°@bbAfter I had captured the land of Sichon and Og,<FJ> @rr°@bbI imagined that the vow had been cancelled. @d1Saying.@d2 @rr°@bbThis is one of the three occasions where Moshe said to the Almighty, “I will not leave You alone until You make known to me whether You will do as I requested or not.”<QC>
@p124@p2<TS>Adonoy, Elohim.@p3 <NHS>@rr°@bbMerciful in judgement. @d1You have begun to show Your servant@d2 @rr°@bban opportunity to stand and pray even though the decree has gone forth. He [Moshe] said to Him, “I learned this from you, for You said to me, ‘Now leave me alone.’ Was I then holding You? [But You said this] to provide an opportunity [and to show] that it was up to me to pray for them. Similarly, I thought to do so now.” @d1Your Greatness.@d2 This refers to Your attribute of goodness. Similarly it is said, @rr°@bb”And now please magnify the Might of my Master.” @d1And Your hand.@d2 This refers to Your right hand @rr°@bbwhich is extended to all who enter the world. @d1Powerful.@d2 @rr°@bbYou subdue with [Your] compassion the attribute of strict justice. @d1That there is no power etc.@d2 @rr°@bbYou are unlike a king of flesh and blood @rr°@bbwho has advisors and critics who would deter him when he wants to do kindness and to forgo his attribute [of strict justice]. You, however, there is no one to deter You, should You pardon me and annul Your decree. @rr°@bbBut according to its simplistic sense [it means]: You have begun to show Your servant the war with Sichon and Og, as it is written, “I have begun defeating before you;” show me also the war with the thirty-one kings. @p125@p2<EN>Please allow me to cross over.@p3 @rr°@bbThe word @hh<HEB>נָא@ee<ENG> denotes a request. @d1This good mountain.@d2 @rr°@bbA reference to Jerusalem. @d1And the Lebanon.@d2 @rr°@bbA reference to the @ITBais HaMikdosh.@it<QC>
@p126@p2<EN>Adonoy grew angry [at me].@p3 @rr°@bbHe was filled with wrath. @d1Through your fault.@d2 @rr°@bbYou caused this [to happen] to me. Similarly it is said, “And they provoked Him at the waters of Merivah, and Moshe suffered harm because of them.” @d1Enough for you.@d2 @rr°@bbSo that people should not say, “How harsh is the Master, and how stubborn and pleading is the disciple.” @rr°@bbAnother explanation of @hh<HEB>רַב לָךְ@ee<ENG>. Much more than this is preserved for you, @rr°@bbgreat is the goodness that is hidden away for you. (Siphre)<QC>
@p127@p2<EN>And see with your own eyes.@p3 You asked of Me — “And let me see the good land”;@rr°@bb I will show you all of it, as it is said, “And Adonoy showed him all the land.” @p128@p2<EN>And command Yehoshua.@p3 @rr°@bbRegarding the troubles, the burdens and the strifes [of leadership.]<QC>
@d1And encourage him and embolden him.@d2 @rr°@bbWith your words so that he will not become faint-hearted, saying, “Just as my teacher (Moshe) was punished because of them, so eventually will I be punished because of them”; I [therefore] assure him that he will cross over and he shall apportion to them [the land.] @d1Because he will cross.@d2 @rr°@bbIf he will cross at the head [of this people] they will possess [the land], but if not they will not possess it. And similarly you find that when he sent some of the people against Ai and he remained [in the camp], “The men of Ai killed [thirty-six] of them.” @rr°@bbAnd when he fell on his face, he [God] said to him, “Get up.” @rr°@bbIt [the word @hh<HEB>קֻם@ee<ENG>] is written [without the @ITvov@it] [so that it can be read] @hh<HEB>קָם לָךְ@ee<ENG> — [It is because of] you remaining in your place and sending My children to war [that caused this defeat.] Why is it that you have fallen on your face? Did I not say this to Moshe, your teacher: If he will cross over [at the head] they will cross, and if not, they will not cross. @p129@p2<EN>We lived in the valley [facing Beis Peor].@p3 @rr°@bbAnd you attached yourselves to idolatry, but nevertheless, “And now Yisroel, listen to the statutes,” and everything is forgiven you.

@p16@p2<EN>You will preserve them.@p3 @rr°@bbThis refers to the study of the Mishnah. @d1And you will fulfill them.@d2 As literally implied. @d1For that [displays] your wisdom and understanding, etc.@d2 @rr°@bbThrough this you will be considered wise and understanding in the eyes of the nations. @p18@p2<EN>Upright statutes and laws.@p3 @rr°@bbThat are proper and acceptable. @p19@p2<EN>[Only] look out for yourself, etc. Lest you forget the words.@p3 Then, if you do not forget them, and you fulfill them correctly @rr°@bbwill you be considered wise and understanding; but if you distort them through forgetfulness, you will be considered fools.<QC>
@p110@p2<EN>The day you stood.@p3 This verse is connected with the preceding verse: “[the words] your eyes witnessed” @rr°@bbon the day you stood at Choreiv, where you saw the thunder and lightning. @d1They will learn.@d2 @rr°@bbFor themselves [@hh<HEB>יֵלְפוּן@ee<ENG>]. @d1They will teach.@d2 Others. [@hh<HEB>יְאַלְפוּן@ee<ENG>].<QC>
@p114@p2<EN>Adonoy commanded me at that time to teach you.@p3 @rr°@bbThis refers to the Oral Law. @p116@p2<EN>@HB<HEB>סָמֶל@ee<ENG>.@p3 Form.@p3 @p119@p2<EN>Or lest you raise your eyes [heavenward] — @p3 @rr°@bbto speculate about the matter, and to set your heart to blunder after them.<QC>
@d1When Adonoy has made them available@d2 @rr°@bbto provide them with light. @rr°@bbAnother explanation: [He made them available] as deities. He did not prevent them @rr°@bbfrom blundering after them, but paved the way for them [to err] through their meaningless speculations, in order to banish them from the world. Similarly it states: “For he smoothes [the way] before his eyes, causing Him [God] to discover his iniquity for which He will hate him. @p120@p2<EN>[Iron] crucible.@p3 This is a vessel in which gold is refined.<QC>
@p121@p2<EN>Grew angry.@p3 He was filled with wrath. @d1On account of your statements.@d2 Because of your attitude and your actions.<QC>
@p122@p2<EN>For I am to die — I am not crossing.@p3 Since he was to die, how was he to cross? But [what he meant was] “even my bones will not cross over.” @p123@p2<EN> An image of anything.@p3 @rr°@bbThe likeness of any object. @d1That Adonoy commanded you.@d2 @rr°@bbThat He commanded you not to make. @p124@p2<EN>A jealous Almighty.@p3 @rr°@bbHe is jealous to take vengeance; In Old French — @ITemportement.@it His anger is glowing to punish those who worship idols.<QC>
@p125@p2<EN>And have grown old.@p3 He hinted to them that they would be exiled from it at the end of @rr°@bbeight hundred and fifty-two years, which is the numerical value [@ITgematria@it] of @hh<HEB>וְנוֹשַׁנְתֶּם@ee<ENG>. But he sent them into exile earlier — at the end of eight hundred and fifty years. He exiled them two years earlier than the numerical value of @hh<HEB>וְנוֹשַׁנְתֶּם@ee<ENG> so they would not suffer the fulfillment of “that you will be completely removed [from the land].” And this is [the meaning of] what is said: “And Adonoy precipitated the evil, and He brought it upon us, @rr°@bbfor Adonoy our God is righteous.” He acted righteously [charitably @hh<HEB>צְדָקָה@ee<ENG>) with us, for He hastened to bring [the evil] two years before its time.<QC>
@p126@p2<EN>I bring as witness against you.@p3 @rr°@bbI have designated them to be witnesses that I have warned you.<QC>
@p128@p2<EN>There you will serve gods.@p3 [This should be understood] as the Targum [has it]: @rr°@bbSince you will serve those who worship them [idols] it will be considered as though you worship them [idols].<QC>
@p131@p2<EN>He will not forsake you by not supporting you with His hands.@p3 The expression of @hh<HEB>לֹא יַרְפְּךָ@ee<ENG> is an expression signifying that He will not cause something — @rr°@bbhe will not cause you to be weakened [forsaken], for He will not separate you from Him. Similarly, “I grasped him and would not let him go,” @rr°@bbthe word @hh<HEB>אַרְפֶּנוּ@ee<ENG> is not vocalized @hh<HEB>אֶרְפֶֶּנוּ@ee<ENG>. The term @hh<HEB>רִפְיוֹן@ee<ENG> always refers to the causative or reflexive form — [one who forsakes others or one who causes himself to be forsaken], as for example: @rr°@bb”Leave her alone,” — let her be released. @rr°@bb”Leave Me alone” — release yourself from Me. @p132@p2<EN>The early years.@p3 @rr°@bbRegarding the early years.<QC>
@d1From one end of the heavens.@d2 Also inquire of all the creatures [that exist] from one end [of heaven] to the other end. This is its plain meaning; but a Midrashic explanation teaches us @rr°@bbregarding the height of Adam @rr°@bbwhich reached from earth to heaven, @rr°@bbwhich is the same measurement as from one end [of the heavens] to the other end.<QC>
@d1Did anything ever happen comparable to this great event?@d2 And what is this great event? [See next verses] Did any people [ever hear], etc. @p134@p2<EN>Did any god ever miraculously [come].@p3 Has any god ever performed such miracles to come and take for himself a nation, etc. All these letters @IThei@it (@hh<HEB>ה@ee<ENG>) are interrogative prefixes, and are therefore vocalized with @ITchataph patach:@it @hh<HEB>הֲנִהְיָה@ee<ENG> — Did anything ever happen. @hh<HEB>הֲנִשְׁמַע@ee<ENG> — Did anyone ever hear @hh<HEB>הֲשָׁמַע@ee<ENG> — Did any people ever hear. @hh<HEB>הֲנִסָּה@ee<ENG> — Did any god ever miraculously. @d1Through tests.@d2 By means of tests, he made His mighty deeds known to them, for example: “Glorify yourself at my expense,” whether I will be able to do so. This is an example of a test. @d1With signs.@d2 With signs to confirm that he [Moshe] is the messenger of the Almighty, for example, “What is that in your hand.” @d1With wonders.@d2 These refer to the wonders that He brought upon them — the astonishing plagues. @d1Through warfare.@d2 [This refers to the episode] of the [Reed] Sea, as it is said, “For Adonoy is fighting for them.” @p135@p2<EN>You have been shown.@p3 @rr°@bbThe word @hh<HEB>הָרְאֵתָ@ee<ENG> according to Targum Onkelos means “You were shown.” When the Holy One, blessed is He, gave the Torah, He lay open for them the seven heavens. And just as he split [opened] the upper spheres so too did He split the lower spheres, and thus they saw that He is the only One. It is therefore stated: “You have been shown that you might know.”<QC>
@p137@p2<EN>Because He loved [your fathers].@p3 @rr°@bbAnd all this was because He loved [your fathers]. @d1And He took you out before Him.@d2 @rr°@bbLike a man who leads his son before him, as it is said, “the angel of God moved [from its position] when it traveled in front of the Israelite camp, and went behind them.” Another explanation: “And He took you out in His Presence,” in the presence of their fathers, as it is said, “In the presence of their fathers, He did wonders.” @rr°@bbDo not be puzzled that it refers to them (the fathers) in the singular for it has [already] written about them in the singular, “And He chose @IThis@it descendants after @IThim.@it” @p138@p2<EN>[Stronger] than you from before you.@p3 Invert [the order of the verse] and then explain it: “to expel from before you nations greater and stronger than you.” @d1Like this day.@d2 Just like you see this day.<QC>
@p141@p2<EN>Then Moshe set aside.@p3 [@hh<HEB>יַבְדִיל@ee<ENG> is the future tense.] @rr°@bbHe gave thought in his heart to be concerned about the matter to set them [the cities] aside.

Another explanation of @hh<HEB>וְלֹא יָסָף@ee<ENG>: He never again revealed Himself @rr°@bbin such a public demonstration. @p124@p2<EN>And you will tell us.@p3 @rr°@bbYou have diminished my strength like that of a woman,<FJ> @rr°@bbfor I was distressed about you and you weakened my hands, because I saw you were not anxious to come near to Him out of love.

@p14@p2<EN>Adonoy is our God, Adonoy is one.@p3 @rr°@bbAdonoy who is presently our God and not the God of the nations, will in the future be [recognized] as the One God, as is said, “For then I will turn over to the peoples a pure language that they may all call upon the Name of Adonoy.” And it is said, “On that day Adonoy will be One and His name One.” @p15--6@p2<EN>You are to love.@p3 @rr°@bbYou are to obey His words (commands) because of your love [for Him]. There is no comparison between one who obeys out of love and one who obeys out of fear. He who obeys (serves) his master out of fear, should the master over burden him, he will leave him and go away. @d1With all your heart.@d2 @rr°@bbWith your two inclinations. @rr°@bbAnother interpretation, “with all your heart” — your heart should not be fragmented with God. @d1With all your soul.@d2 Even if He were to take your soul. @d1And with all your possesions.@d2 With all your wealth. @rr°@bbThere are men whose wealth is dearer to them than their bodies. It is therefore said, “With all your possessions.” @rr°@bbAnother interpretation, “With what ever measure” — with what ever measure He apportions you, whether it is a measure of goodness or a measure of punishment (you must love Him). Similarly did Dovid say: “the cup of deliverance I will raise [and upon the Name, Adonoy, I will call]. “Trouble and sorrow I encounter, [and upon the Name, Adonoy, I call].” @p16@p2<EN>And these words.@p3 @rr°@bbWhat is the form of love [you are commanded]? “These words [that I command you today, etc.]” For in this manner you be aware of the Holy One blessed is He, and You will cling to His ways. @d1That I command you today.@d2 [These words] shall not be in your eyes like an outdated decree @rr°@bbwhich no one takes seriously, @rr°@bbbut rather like a newly given one, which is read eagerly by all. [The word] @hh<HEB>דְיוֹטַגְמָא@ee<ENG> [implies] a royal command in written form. @p17@p2<EN>And you shall teach them.@p3 @rr°@bbThe word @hh<HEB>שִׁנַנְתָּם@ee<ENG> is an expression of sharpness, implying that they (words of Torah) should be sharp in your mouth, so that if a person asks you anything about them, you will not need to stammer (hesitate) about it, but tell him (the answer) immediately. @d1To your children.@d2 @rr°@bb[In this instance @hh<HEB>בָנֶיךָ@ee<ENG>] refers to the disciples (students). We find everywhere that disciples are referred to as children, as it is said, “You are children of Adonoy, your God,” and it says, “the children (disciples) of the prophets who were in Beis Eil.” Similarly in reference to King Chizkiyahu who taught the Torah to all of Yisroel, and he called them children, as it is said, “My children, now, do not be carelessely forgetful.” And even as disciples are called children as it is said, “You are children of Adonoy, your God, so too is the @ITRav@it (teacher) called father, as it is said, “My father, my father, the chariot of Yisroel, etc.” @d1And you are to discuss them.@d2 @rr°@bbYour main discussions should be only about them. Make them (words of Torah) primary and do not make them of secondary importance. @d1When you go to sleep.@d2 I might conclude that this means even if you go to sleep in midday, it is therefore stated, “When you arise.” I might then conclude that this means even if you arise in midnight, @rr°@bbit is therefore stated, “When you sit at home and when you walk on the road”; thus the Torah speaks of the usual way of life, [indicating that @hh<HEB>בְּשָׁכְבְךָ@ee<ENG> means] the usual time of sleeping [and @hh<HEB>בְקוּמֶךָ@ee<ENG> means] the usual time of rising.<QC>

@p118@p2<EN>I prostrated myself before God as before, forty days [and forty nights].@p3@p3 @rr°@bbAs it is said, “I will now ascend to Adonoy, perhaps I will gain atonement for your sin.” During that ascension, I remained for forty days — hence, they came to a close on the twenty-ninth of Av, @rr°@bbas he ascended on the eighteenth of Tammuz. @rr°@bbThat day, God granted the Israelites favor and said to Moshe, “Carve two stones for yourself,” and he remained for an additional forty days — hence, they came to a close on Yom Kippur. That day, the Holy One, may He be blessed, granted favor to the Israelites joyfully, @rr°@bband said to Moshe, ‘I have forgiven, just as you spoke.’ This is why it was designated for atonement and forgiveness. @rr°@bbFrom where is it derived that He granted complete favor? For it is said concerning the forty days of the last tablets, “I remained on the mountain just as during the first days.” Just as the first were with favor, so were the last with favor. You may thus say that the interim days were with anger. @p120@p2<EN>And at Aharon, Adonoy grew very angry.@p3 @rr°@bbBecause he listened to you. @d1To destroy him.@d2 @rr°@bbThis refers to the death of children. Similarly, it is said, “I shall destroy his fruit from above.” @d1I also prayed for Aharon.@d2 @rr°@bbMy prayer was effective in atoning for half. @rr°@bbTwo died, and two were spared. @p121@p2<EN>Grinding.@p3 This is the present tense, like “going,” “longing.” @ITMolant@it in Old French.<QC>
@p125@p2<EN>I prostrated myself, etc.@p3 These are the very days mentioned above. They are repeated here because Scripture here records the pattern of his prayer, as it is said, “Adonoy God, do not destroy your people, etc.”<QC>
@p11@p2<EN>At that time.@p3 At the end of forty days, He granted me favor, and said, “Carve for yourself,” and, afterward, “Make for yourself an ark.” However, I made the ark first, for, when I arrive with the tablets in hand, where shall I place them? Now this is not the ark which Betzalel made, for they were not engaged with the Tabernacle until after Yom Kippur, since, it was only when he descended from the mountain that he instructed them concerning the construction of the Tabernacle. @rr°@bbAnd Betzalel made the Tabernacle first, and afterward the ark and the vessels. Hence, this was a different ark; this one went with them when they waged war, while the one Betzalel made did not go to war, except in Eli’s time, when they were punished over it, and it was captured.<QC>
@p16@p2<EN>Bnei Yisroel travelled from Be’eiros Bnei Ya’akon to Moseiroh.@p3 Why is this relevant here? Furthermore, was it from Be’eiros Bnei Ya’akon that they travelled to Moseiroh? Was it not, rather, from Moseiroh that they came to Bnei Ya’akon, as it is said, “They travelled from Moseiros, etc.”? Also, “There Aharon died”? Was it not at Mount Hor that he died? Make a reckoning, and @rr°@bbyou will discover that there were eight journeys from Moseiros to Mount Hor. But, rather, this, too, is part of the reprimand. ‘In addition, you perpetrated this; When Aharon died at Mount Hor at the end of forty years, and the clouds of glory departed, you were afraid of war with the king of Arad, so you decided to return to Egypt. You turned back eight journeys, until Bnei Ya’akon, and from there to Moseiroh. There, the Levites fought with you. They killed some of you, and you some of them, until they brought you back along the route of your retreat. From there you returned to Goodgode, which is Chor Hagidgad. @p17@p2<EN>And from Goodgode, etc.@d2 At Moseiroh, you expressed deep grief over the death of Aharon, which brought this upon you, so that it seemed to you as if he had died there. Moshe juxtaposed this reprimand with the shattering of the tablets to teach that the death of the righteous is as disagreeable before God, as the day when the tablets were shattered. Also, to inform you that He was as disturbed when they exclaimed, “Let us choose a leader” in order to turn away from Him as on the day that they made the [golden] calf. @p18@p2<EN>At that time, Adonoy separated, etc.@p3 This refers to the original subject. @d1At that time.@d2 During the first year of your departure from Egypt, when you transgressed with the calf, @rr°@bband the Levites did not transgress, the Omnipresent separated them from you. This passage is juxtaposed with the retreat to Bnei Ya’akon to teach that, here as well, the Levites did not transgress, but remained steadfast in their faith. @d1To carry the ark.@d2 The Levites. @d1To stand before Adonoy to serve Him, and to bless in his Name.@d2 The @ITkohanim.@it This refers to the lifting of the hands. @p19@p2<EN>This is why Levi had no share.@p3 @rr°@bbBecause they were separated for service at the altar, and do not have the opportunity for plowing and planting.<QC>
@d1Adonoy is his heritage.@d2 @rr°@bbHe receives his allotted portion provided readily from the palace of the King. @p110@p2<EN>And I remained on the mountain.@p3 To receive the last tablets.

These are R’ Yehudah’s remarks. R’ Nechemiah said to him, ‘But is it not already stated, “The earth opened its mouth”  — not “its mouths”?’ He said, ‘Then how am I to sustain “amid all of Yisroel”’? He replied, @rr°@bb‘The ground sloped, funnel-like, so that wherever one of them was, he rolled into the abyss. @d1And all the sustenance at their feet.@d2 This refers to a man’s wealth, which establishes him on his feet.<QC>

@p110@p2<EN>Is not like the land of Egypt.@p3 But better than it. @rr°@bbThis assurance was made to the Israelites when they departed from Egypt, when they said, ‘Perhaps we shall never come to a land as good and as beautiful as this.’ @rr°@bbBut perhaps Scripture speaks derogatorily and this is what he told them: ‘It is not like the land of Egypt, but inferior to it.’ @rr°@bbThe Torah therefore teaches, “Chevron was built seven years before, etc.” One man built them, Cham built Tzoan for his son Mitzrayim, and Chevron for Canaan. it is customary for a man to build the superior one and afterward build the inferior one, so that what is discarded by the first is relegated to the second. Everywhere, what is cherished takes precedence. Thus you learn that Chevron is superior to Tzoan. Now Mitzrayim is the most praiseworthy of all lands, as it is said, “Like Adonoy’s garden, like the land of Mitzrayim.” And Tzoan was the most praiseworthy in Mitzrayim, for it was the seat of royalty, as it is said, “for his ministers were in Tzoan.” Chevron was most inferior in Eretz Yisroel — that is why it was set aside as a cemetery. Yet, despite this, it was superior to Tzoan. @rr°@bbIn Kesubos, this is expounded differently. Is it possible that a man would build a home for his younger son, and then for his older son? @rr°@bbRather, it was built up seven times more than Tzoan. @d1From which you departed.@d2 @rr°@bbEven the land of Raamses [and Goshen], where you dwelt, which is the best of the land of Mitzrayim, as it is said, “in the best of the land, etc.” — even that cannot compare with Eretz Yisroel. @d1And watered it on foot.@d2 In the land of Egypt, you had to bring water from the Nile on foot in order to irrigate it; you had to lose sleep, to toil. The lowlands were irrigable, but not the highlands, and you had to bring the water up from the low areas to the high ones. But with this, “by the rain of the skies you will drink water.” You can sleep in your bed while the Holy One, may He be blessed, irrigates lowland and highland, open and enclosed areas alike. @d1Like a vegetable garden.@d2 For which rainfall is insufficient. It must be irrigated on foot, with [the water carried on] the shoulders. @p111@p2<EN>Is a land of mountains and plains.@p3 The mountain is more valuable than the plain, for in the plain, on a @ITkor@it-sized parcel you may plant a @ITkor,@it but on the mountain, a @ITkor@it-sized parcel yields five @ITkors@it — four on its four slopes, and one at its peak. @d1And plains.@d2 This refers to level areas. @p112@p2<EN>That Adonoy, your God, looks after.@p3 But does He not look after all the lands, as it is said, “Bringing rain to no-man’s land”? But, rather, it is as if He seeks after no other land but this, and as a result of seeking after this, He incidentally seeks after all the other lands. @d1The eyes of Adonoy, your God, are always upon it.@d2 @rr°@bbTo see what its needs are, and to initiate decrees concerning it, sometimes beneficial, and sometimes damaging, etc., @rr°@bbas stated in tractate Rosh Hashanah. @d1From the year’s beginning.@d2 From the beginning of the year judgement is passed determining what is to occur at its end. @p113@p2<EN>Should you heed [lit., “It shall be . . .”].@p3 “It shall be” relates to the statement above, @rr°@bb”by the rain of the skies you will drink water.” @d1Should you thoroughly heed.@d2 @rr°@bbIf you heed the old, then you shall heed the new. Similarly, “It shall be, if forgetting you forget.” If you begin forgetting, you shall eventually forget everything. @rr°@bbThis is as it is written in the scroll, ‘If you forsake me for a day, I shall forsake you for two.’ @d1Commanding you today.@d2 They must be as fresh to you, @rr°@bbas if you heard them this very day. @d1To love Adonoy.@d2 You must not say, ‘I shall study so that I may become wealthy, or so that I may be entitled “Rabbi,” or so that I may be rewarded.’ @rr°@bbRather, all that you fulfill, fulfill with love, and the glory will eventually follow. @d1And to serve Him with all your hearts.@d2 With the service of the heart — this refers to prayer, as prayer is entitled “service,” as it is said, “Your God whom you constantly serve.” Was there service in Bavel? Rather, because he prayed, as it is said, “Windows were open for him, etc.” Similarly, with Dovid it is said, “May my prayer be established like incense before You.” @d1With all your hearts and with all your souls.@d2 But has not Scripture already commanded, “With all your heart and with all your soul”? Evidently, @rr°@bbone command is addressed to the individual, and the other command is addressed to the community.<QC>
@p114@p2<EN>I will provide the rain of your land.@p3 @rr°@bbYou fulfilled your obligation — I, too, shall fulfill my obligation. @d1In its time.@d2 During the night, so that it does not trouble you. Another interpretation of “in its time.” @rr°@bbOn Shabbos eve, when everyone is at home. @d1Fall rain.@d2 This refers to the rain which falls after seeding, saturating the earth and the seeds. @d1Spring rain.@d2 This refers to the rain which falls just prior to the harvest, filling the stalks with grain. The word @hh<HEB>מַלְקוֹשׁ@ee<ENG> denotes something which arrives late, as Targum renders “the late ones,” @hh<HEB>לַקִּישָׁא@ee<ENG> Another interpretation. It is called @hh<HEB>מַלְקוֹשׁ@ee<ENG> @rr°@bbbecause it descends on the ears and on the stalks. @d1You will harvest your grain.@d2 @rr°@bbYou will gather it into your home, not your enemies, as it is said, “...if I give your grain, etc., for he who gathers it shall consume it,” but not as it is said, “It shall come to pass that if Yisroel plants, etc.” @p115@p2<EN>And I will provide grass in your field.@p3 @rr°@bbSo that it will not be necessary for you to lead it to the desert. Another interpretation. You will reap your produce throughout the entire rainy season, and throw it before your animals. Then you will discontinue reaping for thirty days prior to the harvest, and there will be no shortfall of grain. @d1And you will eat and be full.@d2 @rr°@bbThis a different blessing — the blessing will visit the bread with your abdomen, so that you will eat and be full. @p116@p2<EN>Look out for yourselves.@p3 Since you will eat and be full, look out for yourselves, so that you are not insubordinate, for a man does not rebel against the Holy One, may He be blessed, except when satiated, as it is said, “Lest you eat and become full, and your cattle and flocks multiply.” What is said afterward? “You shall become arrogant and forget.” @d1And you turn away.@d2 @rr°@bbBy abandoning the Torah, and because of this, “you serve alien gods.” For once a man abandons the Torah, he proceeds to adhere to idolatry. Similarly, Dovid said, “For they have driven me away, this day, from adherence to Adonoy’s heritage, saying, ‘Go, worship, etc.”’ Now who said this to him? But, rather, since I have been driven away from engaging in the study of Torah, I am thereby brought close to worshipping alien gods. @d1Alien gods.@d2 @rr°@bbThey are alien to those who worship them — he cries out to him, but he does not respond. Thus, he has become alienated from him. @p117@p2<EN>Its produce.@p3 @rr°@bbEven what you bring to it, as it is said, “You have planted much, but gathered little.” @d1And you will swiftly be removed.@d2 @rr°@bbIn addition to all the other suffering, I will exile you from the land @rr°@bbwhich caused you to sin. This is compared to a king who sent his son off to a feast, but sat and admonished him, ‘Do not overindulge in eating, so that you may return home in cleanliness.’ The son payed no attention, overindulged in eating and drinking, vomited, and filthied everyone attending the feast. He grasped his hand and foot, and flung him behind the palace. @d1Swiftly.@d2 I will not allow you any extension. @rr°@bbBut you may ask, was not an extension granted to the generation of the flood, as it is said, “His days shall be a hundred and twenty years”? The generation of the flood @rr°@bbhad no one from whom to learn. You, however, have someone from whom to learn. @p118@p2<EN>You are to place these words of Mine.@p3 @rr°@bbEven after you are exiled, you must distinguish yourselves by performing @ITmitzvos.@it Set the @ITtefilin@it in place, and affix the @ITmezuzos,@it so that they do not seem novel when you return. Similarly, it is said, “Establish marks of distinction for yourself.” @p119@p2<EN>To speak in them.@p3 @rr°@bbFrom the time that the son is able to speak, teach him “Torah, Moshe commanded us,” so that this develops his speech. From here it is said that, when an infant begins speaking, his father should converse with him in the sacred language, and teach him Torah. If he failed to do this, it is as if he had buried him, for it is said, “Teach them to your sons to speak in them, etc.”<QC>
@p121@p2<EN>In order that they will be many — your years and the years of your children.@p3 If you do this, they will be many, but if not, they will not be many, for the Torah’s statements may be expounded so that the negative infers the positive, and the positive infers the negative. @d1To give them.@d2 “To give you” is not written here, but “to give them.” @rr°@bbThus, we discover the derivation of the revival of the dead from the Torah. @p122@p2<EN>You truly guard.@p3 This admonishment includes many warnings. One must be diligent in learning, so that it will not be forgotten.<QC>
@d1To walk in all His ways.@d2 He is merciful — you should be merciful. He acts kindly — you should act kindly. @d1And to cling to Him.@d2 Is it possible to say this? Is He not a consuming fire? @rr°@bbRather, cling to the disciples and the sages, and I will credit you as if you had clung to Him. @p123@p2<EN>Adonoy will expel.@p3 @rr°@bbYou have fulfilled your obligations — I, too, shall fulfill my obligation. @d1And more powerful than you.@d2 You are powerful, but they are more powerful than you. For, if the Israelites are not powerful, what kind of praise is it by which He extols the Emorites by saying that they are more powerful than you? But rather, you are more powerful than the other nations, and they are more powerful than you. @p125@p2<EN>No man will stand up, etc.@p3 I only know a man. A nation, family, or sorceress with her witchcraft — how is this derived? @rr°@bbThe Torah therefore teaches, “there will not stand up” — in any case. If so, why does the Torah teach “a man”? @rr°@bbEven one like Og, king of Bashan.<QC>
@d1Fear of you and awe of you.@d2 But are not fear and awe the same? Evidently, “fear of you” refers to those nearby, and “awe of you” to those distant. “Fear” denotes sudden fright, @rr°@bb”awe” denotes long term dread. @d1As he promised you.@d2 Where did He promise? “I shall send My fear before you.”<QC>
@p126@p2<EN>Look, I place a blessing and a curse.@p3 @rr°@bbTo be pronounced at Mount Gerizim and Mount Eival. @p127@p2<EN>The blessing.@p3 @rr°@bbOn condition that you listen.<QC>
@p128@p2<EN>From the course which I command you this day, to follow.@p3 This teaches that anyone who worships idols @rr°@bbhas strayed from the entire course commanded to Yisroel. @rr°@bbFrom here it is derived that anyone who admits to idolatry denies the entire Torah. @p129@p2<EN>You shall place the blessers.@p3 @rr°@bbAs Targum [Onkelos] renders, @hh<HEB>יָת מְבָרְכַיּאָ@ee<ENG>, “The blessers.” @d1On Mount Gerizim.@d2 @rr°@bbTowards Mount Gerizim @rr°@bbthey turned their faces, and opened with the blessing, “Blessed is the man who does not make a sculptured or molten, etc.” All the curses in that chapter were first recited with the word “blessed.” Then @rr°@bbthey turned their faces towards Mount Eival, and opened with the curse. @p130@p2<EN>Are they not.@p3 @rr°@bbThis provides the landmarks. @d1Far beyond.@d2 @rr°@bbFar after the crossing of the Yardein, in the distance beyond, @rr°@bbas indicated by the word “beyond.” Wherever @hh<HEB>אַחֲרֵי@ee<ENG> — “beyond” is mentioned, the reference is to great distance. @d1Along the route of the sunset.@d2 @rr°@bbBeyond the Yardein, toward the west. The cantillation of the passage proves that they are two matters, @rr°@bbsince they are punctuated with two cantillation symbols; @hh<HEB>אַחֲרֵי@ee<ENG>, “far beyond,” is punctuated with the @ITpashta@it symbol, @rr°@bbwhile @hh<HEB>דֶרֶךְ@ee<ENG>, “the route,” is punctuated with the @ITmishpal@it symbol, and is dotted. If @hh<HEB>אַחֲרֵי דֶּרֶךְ@ee<ENG>, “far beyond the route,” were a single phrase, @rr°@bbthen @hh<HEB>אַחֲרֵי@ee<ENG>, “far beyond,” would be punctuated with the @ITmeshares@it symbol — the reverse @ITshofar@it — and @hh<HEB>דֶּרֶךְ@ee<ENG>, “route,” would be punctuated with the @ITpashta@it symbol, and would be undotted. @d1Opposite Gilgal.@d2 @rr°@bbAt a distance from Gilgal. @d1Moreh Plain.@d2 @rr°@bbThis was Shechem, as it is said, “Until the territory of Shechem — until Moreh Plain.” @p131@p2<EN>For you shall pass across the Yardein, etc.@p3 @rr°@bbThe miracles at the Yardein will portend, for you, that you will enter the land and take possession of it. @p12@p2<EN>You must obliterate.@p3 @rr°@bbDestroy, then destroy afterward. This teaches that, when destroying idolatry, one must tear out the roots.<QC>
@d1All of the places where the nations worshipped, etc.@d2 @rr°@bbWhat must you obliterate from them? ‘Their gods on the mountains.’ @p13@p2<EN>Altar.@p3 Composed of a number of stones. @d1Pillar.@d2 Single-stoned. This is the @IT‘bimus’@it mentioned in the Mishnah, ‘A stone quarried originally as a @ITbimus.@it’ @d1@BIAsherah.@it@d2 @rr°@bbA tree that was worshipped.<QC>
@d1Obliterate their name.@d2 Give them degrading nicknames. @rr°@bb”The house of exaltation,” entitle “The house of ruin.” “Universal vision” — “Thorny vision.” @p14@p2<EN>Do not act this way.@p3 @rr°@bbBy bringing burnt-offerings for the sake of Heaven anywhere except for the place [God] will select. Another interpretation. ‘Smash their altars, obliterate their names — do not act this way.<TIE>.<TIE>.’ @rr°@bbThis prohibits erasing the sacred name, and breaking an altar stone, or a Temple courtyard stone.<QC>
@rr°@bbRebbi Yishmael said, ‘Is it conceivable that an Israelite would smash altars? Rather, do not act as they do, whereby your iniquity would cause the ruin of the Temple of your forefathers.’ @p15@p2<EN>Seek His Presence.@p3 @rr°@bbThis refers to the Tabernacle at Shiloh.<QC>
@p16@p2<EN>Your sacred offerings.@p3 @rr°@bbObligatory  @ITshelamim@it-offerings. @d1Your tithes.@d2 The animal tithe @rr°@bband the second tithe, to be eaten within the walls [of Jerusalem]. @d1The elevation of your hands.@d2 This refers to the first @ITbikurim@it-<FJ> fruits, concerning which it is said, “The @ITkohein@it shall take the basket from your hand.” @d1The first born of your cattle.@d2 @rr°@bbTo give to the @ITkohein,@it so that he may offer them up there.<QC>
@p17@p2<EN>As Adonoy has blessed you.@p3 @rr°@bbAccording to the blessing, bring. @p18@p2<EN>You may not do everything we do, etc.@p3 This continues from above, from “For you shall pass across the Yardein, etc.” @rr°@bbWhen you cross the Yardein, you will be immediately permitted to bring up offerings on the personal @ITbamah@it-altar, thoughout all fourteen years of conquest and apportionment. However, on the personal @ITbamah@it-altar, you may not offer everything you offer here, this day, at the Mishkan, which remains with you and has been anointed. This is an appropriate place for bringing sin-and guilt-offerings, and promissory and contributory-offerings. However, on the personal @ITbamah@it-altar, nothing may be offered except for the promissory and contributory, And this is the meaning of “each what is upright in his eyes.” Promissory-and contributory offerings, That you donate because you feel it is proper to bring them and not because you @ITmust.@it These you may offer on a personal @ITbamah@it-altar.<QC>
@p19@p2<EN>For you will not have come.@p3 @rr°@bbThroughout those fourteen years. @d1As yet.@d2 @rr°@bbLike “yet.” @d1To the peace.@d2 This refers to Shiloh. @d1The territory.@d2 This refers to Jerusalem.<QC>
@p110@p2<EN>When you cross the Yardein and settle in the land.@p3 When you have apportioned it, @rr°@bband everyone distinguishes his portion and his tribe. @d1And He has granted you peace.@d2 After the conquest and apportionment, and peace with the nations whom Adonoy allowed to remain in order to test Yisroel — this did not occur until the time of Dovid — then: @p111@p2<EN>Let it be that the place, etc.@p3 Build, for yourselves, the chosen Sanctuary in Jerusalem. This is as it is said concerning Dovid: “It was, when the king had settled in his palace, and Adonoy had granted him peace on every side, from all his enemies; then the king said to the prophet Noson, ‘Look here, I am settled in a palace of cedarwood, while the ark of God languishes amidst curtains.”’<QC>
@d1It is there that you shall bring.@d2 @rr°@bbThe discussion above concerns Shiloh, while the discussion here concerns Jerusalem. This is why Scripture separates them, by granting permission between them. @rr°@bbFrom the time that Shiloh was laid waste and they arrived at Nov, and Nov was laid waste and they arrived at Giveon, personal @ITbamah@it-altars were permitted, until they arrived at Jerusalem. @d1Your choice promissory-offerings.@d2 This teaches that one must offer the choicest.<QC>
@p113@p2<EN>Take heed.@p3 @rr°@bbThis places a negative commandment over the matter. @d1Anywhere you envision as proper.@d2 Which occurs to you. @rr°@bbHowever, you may bring an offering by prophetic instruction, as with Eliyahu at Mount Carmel. @p114@p2<EN>Of one of your tribes.@p3 @rr°@bbIn Binyamin’s portion.<QC>
@p1@p2@p3@rr°@bbAbove, however, it is said, “of all your tribes.” How can this be? When Dovid purchased the threshing site from Aravna the Yevusite, he gathered the gold from all the tribes; still, the threshing site was in Binyamin’s territory. @p115@p2<EN>Except, with the fullness of your appetite.@p3 What is Scripture’s subject? Is it “appetite meat,” permitting it to them without offering the sacrificial portions? But it is stated elsewhere, “When Adonoy, your God, expands your borders, etc., and you assert, ‘Let me eat meat, etc.”’ What, then, is the subject here? Sacred animals which were afflicted with a blemish which may be redeemed and eaten anywhere. @rr°@bbPerhaps they may be redeemed even with a transient blemish? The Torah therefore teaches, “except.” @d1You may slaughter and eat.@d2 @rr°@bbYou are not permitted to shear or milk, but only to eat by slaughtering. @d1The ritually unclean and the clean.@d2 Because this was converted from a sacred sacrifice, concerning which it is said, “Meat which came into contact with anything unclean may not be eaten,” it is necessary @rr°@bbto permit the unclean and the clean to eat it in a single plate.<QC>
@d1Like the deer and the gazelle@d2 @rr°@bbwhich are not eligible as sacrifices. @d1Like the deer and the gazelle.@d2 This exempts them from the gifts of the foreleg, the jaw, and the maw. @p116@p2<EN>However, you may not eat the blood.@p3 Although I have stated that @rr°@bbits blood is not to be sprinkled on the altar, you may not eat it. @d1Spill it like water.@d2 @rr°@bbThis teaches you that it does not require covering. @rr°@bbAnother interpretation. It is like water with regard to the conditioning (@IThechsher@it) of edible seeds [for ritual contamination]. @p117@p2<EN>You are not permitted.@p3 @rr°@bbThis passage places a negative commandment over the matter. @d1You are not permitted [lit. not able].@d2 R’ Yehoshua ben Korchah said, ‘You are able, but are not permitted.” Similarly, “The Yevusites, who dwelt in Jerusalem, the sons of Yehudah were not permitted [lit. not able] to drive out.” They were able, but were not permitted, because Avrohom had made a covenant with them, when he bought the double tiered Machpelah-cave from them. They were not Yevusites, but Chitites, but, in recognition of the city entitled Yevus (they were called Yevusites). This is stated clearly in Pirkei dR’ Eliezer. This is why it is said, “...unless you cast aside the blind and the lame” — @rr°@bbthe statues on which the oath was inscribed. @d1The first born of your cattle.@d2 @rr°@bbThis prohibition applies to the @ITkohanim.@it @d1The @BIterumah@BO-separation of your hand.@d2 @rr°@bbThis refers to the first fruits. @p118@p2<EN>Before Adonoy.@p3 @rr°@bbWithin the walls. @d1And the Levite in your cities.@d2 If you do not have his portion for him — for example, the first tithe — give him the tithe of the indigent. If you do not have the tithe of the indigent, invite him to partake of your @ITshelamim@it-offering. @p119@p2<EN>Watch yourself.@p3 @rr°@bbThis places a negative commandment over the matter. @d1On your land.@d2 @rr°@bbIn the diaspora, however, you are not admonished to concern yourself with him more than with the indigent Israelites. @p120@p2<EN>When .<TIE>.<TIE>. expands, etc.@p3 The Torah teaches proper behavior — a man should not crave eating meat @rr°@bbunless he enjoys expansion and affluence. @d1To the full extent of your appetite, etc.@d2 @rr°@bbHowever, in the wilderness, non-sacrificial meat was forbidden to them, unless it was sanctified and brought as a @ITshelamim@it-offering.<QC>
@p121@p2<EN>When the place is distant from you.@p3 So that you are unable to come every day to offer the @ITshelamim@it sacrifice, as you are now, when the Mishkan travels with you, @d1you may slaughter, as I have commanded you.@d2 We learn that there is a command concerning the proper method of slaughtering. This refers to the slaughtering laws told to Moshe at Sinai. @p122@p2<EN>Only, as the deer, etc, may be eaten.@p3 @rr°@bbYou are not admonished to eat them in ritual purity. @rr°@bbPerhaps, just as the fat of the deer and the gazelle are permitted, so is the fat of the non-sacrificial animal permitted? The Torah therefore teaches, “only.” @p123@p2<EN>Only exercise strength in not eating the blood.@p3 From the statement “exercise strength,” you learn that they wallowed in the eating of blood. It was therefore necessary to say “exercise strength.” This is R’ Yehudah’s opinion. R’ Shimon ben Azai said, Scripture merely admonishes and teaches you the extent to which @rr°@bbyou must exercise strength with @ITmitzvos.@it If blood, which is easily avoided, as a man has no craving for it, yet it is necessary to strengthen you in admonishing against it; then certainly the other commandments. @d1Do not eat the spirit with the meat.@d2 @rr°@bbThis prohibits the limb of a living animal. @p124@p2<EN>Do not eat it.@p3 @rr°@bbThis prohibits the dripping @ITtamtzis@it blood. @p125@p2<EN>Do not eat it.@p3 @rr°@bbThis prohibits the blood absorbed in the limbs. @d1So that you may enjoy beneficence, etc.@d2 Go forth, learn the reward for @ITmitzvos.@it Take blood, which a man finds repugnant; yet, one who refrains from it gains merit for himself and his children after him. Certainly with larceny and promiscuousness, which a man craves.<QC>
@p126@p2<EN>However, your sacred offerings.@p3 Although you may slaughter non-sacrificial animals, I did not permit you to slaughter sacrificial offerings and eat them in your cities without offering them up. Rather, bring them to the chosen Sanctuary. @p127@p2<EN>Execute your burnt-offerings.@p3 @rr°@bbIf they are burnt-@ITolah@it-<FJ> offerings, place the flesh and the blood on the altar. If they are @ITshelamim@it-peace-offerings, “the blood of your sacrifices shall be poured on the altar” first, and then “the flesh may be eaten.” The Rabbis expounded additionally. “However, your sacrificial-offerings<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”: @rr°@bbThis teaches concerning sacrificial-offerings outside the land. And it teaches that exchange-offerings and the offspring of sacrifices must be offered up. @p128@p2<EN>Preserve.@p3 This refers to the study of the law, which must be preserved in one’s gut, not to be forgotten, as it is said, “It is pleasurable that you preserve them in your gut.” If you have studied the law, then it is possible for you to heed and to perform; @rr°@bbbut anyone who is not involved in study can not be involved in performance. @d1All these words.@d2 @rr°@bbA minor commandment should be as precious to you as one of great consequence. @d1That which is good.@d2 @rr°@bbIn the eyes of Heaven. @d1And that which is upright.@d2 In the eyes of mortals.<QC>
@p130@p2<EN>Lest you are torn apart.@p3 Onkelos’ interpretation is that the reference is to a pitfall. In my opinion, he was not exacting in following the literal meaning, for we never find the letter ‘@hh<HEB>נ@ee<ENG> in the word @hh<HEB>יוֹקֵשׁ@ee<ENG>, “pitfall,” even as a root letter which is sometimes dropped. However, in reference to tearing apart and violent shaking, we find the ‘@hh<HEB>נ@ee<ENG>, “His knees knocked against each other.” Here, too, my rendition is, “Lest you are torn apart with them,” by emulating their activities. Similarly, “Let the debtor jostle after all his possessions.”  He curses the villain, wishing him numerous debtors who will jostle one another in pursuit of his money. @d1After they have been annihilated before you.@d2 @rr°@bbAfter you observe when I have annihilated them before you, focus your attention as to why I annihilated them — because of their decadent behavior. So you refrain from emulating them so that no one come to annihilate you. @d1How did .<TIE>.<TIE>. worship?@d2 Since no punishment was specified for idol worship except for slaughtering, burning, pouring libations, or prostrating oneself, as it is written, “For the sake of none but Adonoy alone” — activities generally performed for the sake of the Supreme Being. This passage proceeds to teach that, if it is customary to worship an idol with some other ritual @rr°@bbfor example, exposing oneself for the sake of Peor, or casting a stone for the sake of @ITMarkolis@it — then that is its recognized worship form, and [the worshiper] is liable. However, for slaughtering, burning, pouring libations, and prostrating oneself, even when not customary, one is liable. @p131@p2<EN>For, even their sons.@p3 “Even” includes their fathers and mothers. R’ Akiva said, ‘I saw a Gentile tie his father before his dog, who then ate him.’<QC>
@p11@p2<EN>Everything.@p3 The less significant as well as the greatly consequential. @d1Be careful to fulfill.@d2 This adds a negative command to the positive commands stated in this chapter, as “be careful” always denotes a negative command, except that one is not punished with lashes for violating “be careful” when it is added to a positive command. @d1Do not add to it.@d2 @rr°@bbFive @ITtotafos@it with the @ITtefilin,@it five species with the @ITlulav,@it four benedictions with the priestly benediction. @p12@p2<EN>And he gives you an omen.@p3 In the heavens, as it is said with Gideon, “Produce an omen for me,” and it is said, “Please, let the fleece be dry, etc.” @d1Or a miracle.@d2 On earth.

Similarly, “And from the area wrapped in the earth” — from the foundation embedded in the earth. @d1Who is your soul mate.@d2 @rr°@bbThis refers to your father. Scripture specifies those whom you cherish — certainly with others. @d1Clandestinely.@d2 Scripture depicts ordinary circumstances. The seducer will ordinarily only deliver his message clandestinely. Similarly, Solomon says, “In the evening, when day has darkened into night, in the black of night and murkiness.” @d1Whom you never knew, neither you nor your forefathers.@d2 This is something extremely degrading to you, for even the Gentile nations do not abandon their forefathers’ tradition; yet, he tells you ‘Abandon your forefathers’ tradition’! @p18@p2<EN>Who are near you or at a distance.@p3 Why specify “near” and “distant”? Rather, Scripture states the following: By the nature of those nearby, you may learn the nature of those at distance.

Without a yoke, as they have cast off the yoke of Heaven. @d1Men.@d2 @rr°@bbBut not women. @d1The inhabitants of their city.@d2 But not the inhabitants of another city. From here it is derived that an apostate city cannot be so designated unless suborned by men, and by its own constituents. @p115@p2<EN>You must investigate, inquire, and interrogate thoroughly.@d2 From here it is derived that there are seven inquiries, from the added passages. Here there are three: “investigation,” “inquiry,” and “thoroughness.” “Interrogate” is not counted, since the examining interrogation is derived from there. Elsewhere, it is said, “The magistrates must investigate thoroughly.” Still elsewhere, it is said, “You must investigate thoroughly.” @rr°@bb”Thoroughly” and “Thoroughly” are extrapolated by the principle of textual comparison, so that the Torah’s specifications with each may be applied to the other. @p116@p2<EN>You must surely strike down.@p3 If you are unable to execute them by the method specified by Scripture for them, execute them by another method.<QC>

@p11@p2<EN>Do not lacerate yourselves.@p3 @rr°@bbDo not inflict lacerations and gashes on your flesh over the dead, as is the custom among the Emorites for you are God’s children, and must therefore appear suitably becoming, rather than lacerated and hairless. @d1Between your eyes.@d2 Near the forehead.

@p12@p2<EN>For you are a sacred people.@p3 @rr°@bbYour own sanctity extends from your forefathers; in addition, “Adonoy has chosen you.” @p13@p2<EN>Any abomination.@p3 @rr°@bbAnything I made abominable to you. For example, puncturing the ear of a first-born animal in order to slaughter it outside the Sanctuary — this is something I made abominable to you, from “There shall not be any blemish on it.” Here the Torah proceeds to teach that it is forbidden to slaughter it and then eat it on the basis of that blemish. If one cooked meat with milk — this is something I made abominable to you, so eating it is prohibited here.<QC>
@p14@p2<EN>These are the animals<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. @p15@p2<EN>the gazelle, the deer, the antelope.@d2 We learn that wild animals are included in the word @hh<HEB>בְּהֵמָה@ee<ENG>, “animal”; and we learn that the unclean domestic and wild animals are more numerous than the clean ones, since the less numerous are specified everywhere. @d1The ibex.@d2 Targum renders “wild goat,” “Mountain goats.” This is the @ITesteinbuc@it [in Old French]. @d1And the wild ox.@d2 @ITTorbala,@it ‘ox of the forest.’ @ITBala,@it ‘forest’ in Aramaic. @p16@p2<EN>Cloven.@p3 @rr°@bbSplit, as Targum [Onkelos] renders. @d1Hoof.@d2 @ITPlante@it [in Old French]. @d1Truly split.@d2 Divided into two nails. Some are cloven, but not divided into nails. They are unclean. @d1Within the animals.@d2 @rr°@bbThe inference is, ‘what is found within the animal, you may eat.’ From here it is derived that the fetus is permitted through the slaughter of its mother. @p17@p2<EN>The dromedary.@p3 A creature with two humps and two spinal columns. The Rabbis remark: Why were they repeated? The animals — because of the dromedary, and the fowl — because of the @ITra’ah,@it which were not listed in Toras Kohanim.<QC>
@p18@p2<EN>And do not come in contact with their carcasses.@p3 The Rabbis explain that this applies during the festivals, for a man is required to purify himself during the festival. Perhaps the admonition applies throughout the year? The Torah therefore teaches, “Say to the @ITkohanim,@it etc.” If uncleanliness emanating from a human corpse is stringent, restricting only the @ITkohanim,@it but not the Israelites — then the lenient uncleanliness emanating from an animal carcass is — certainly. @p111@p2<EN>You may eat any pure bird.@p3 @rr°@bbThis permits the bird released by the @ITmetzora. @it @p112@p2<EN>This is what you may not eat.@p3 @rr°@bbThis prohibits the slaughtered bird. @p113@p2<EN>The @BIra’ah, ayah,@BO etc.@p3 The @ITra’ah, @rr°@bbayah,@it and @ITdayah@it are one and the same. Why is it entitled “@ITra’ah@it”? Because its vision is exceedingly powerful. Why does our prohibition specify all its names? In order to refute those who would take exception; so that one does not prohibit it as “@ITra’ah,@it” while another permits it with the claim that its name is “@ITdayah,@it” or its name is “@ITayah,@it” and it was thus never prohibited by Scripture. @rr°@bbWith the birds, the impure ones are specified. This teaches that the pure birds are more numerous than the impure ones. @rr°@bbTherefore, those less numerous are specified.<QC>
@p116@p2<EN>And the @ITtinshames.@it@p3 @ITChalve soriz,@it [in Old French]. @p117@p2<EN>The @ITshalach.@it@p3 Which catches fish in the ocean. @p118@p2<EN>The @ITduchifas.@it@p3 This refers to the wild turkey, in Old French, @ITherupe,@it with a double crest. @p119@p2<EN>Flying creeping creatures.@p3 This refers to tiny insects that creep along the ground.

Similarly with the animals: “That, you may eat” — but not impure animals. A negative command derived from a positive statement is regarded as a positive command, so that the violator transgresses a positive as well as a negative command. @p121@p2<EN>To the alien in your cities.@p3 The resident alien, who has resolved to refrain from idolatry, but eats meat without ritual slaughter. @d1For you are a people sanctified to Adonoy.@d2 @rr°@bbSanctify yourselves by abstaining from that which is permitted.

The Holy One, may He be blessed, said to Yisroel, @rr°@bb‘Do not cause Me to cook the young shoots of your crops while still in their mothers’ innards, for, if you do not tithe properly, just before their ripening I shall summon the east wind and batter them, as it is said, “battered before becoming standing grain.” @rr°@bbSimilarly, with regard to the @ITbikurim@it-gift. @d1On a yearly basis.@d2 @rr°@bbFrom here it is derived that one may not use the new crop as tithe for the old. @p123@p2<EN>You shall eat, etc.@p3 This refers to the second tithe, for we have already been taught to give the first tithe to the Levites, as it is said, “When you receive, from the Israelites, etc.” And they are permitted to eat it anywhere, as it is said, “You may eat it anywhere.” Obviously, then, this refers to a different tithe. @p124@p2<EN>For .<TIE>.<TIE>. has blessed you.@p3 @rr°@bbSo that the grain is too abundant to carry. @p126@p2<EN>For anything you desire.@p3 This is a general statement. @d1For cattle, flocks, wine, intoxicating liquor.@d2 This is specific. @d1And for anything that you wish.@d2 This is a return to the general.

@p127@p2<EN>And the Levite, etc., you must not abandon. @p3 @rr°@bbBy neglecting to give him the first tithe. @d1Since he has no portion or inheritance with you.@d2 @rr°@bbThis excludes the gleaning, forgotten sheaves, and edge of the field gifts, and abandoned produce, since his share in them is equivalent to yours. Hence, they are exempt from tithing. @p128@p2<EN>At the end of three years.@p3 This comes to teach that if one withheld his tithes during the first and second years of the @ITshmittah@it-cycle, he must divest his home of them during the third year.<QC>
@p129@p2<EN>The Levite shall come.@p3 @rr°@bbAnd take the first tithe. @d1And the proselyte and the orphan.@d2 They take the second tithe, which belongs to the indigent this year. You are not required to eat it in Jerusalem, the way you are required to eat the second tithe during the first two years. @d1Let them eat their fill.@d2 Give them enough to satiate them. From here we derive, “One may not give the indigent in the threshing area less than, etc.” @rr°@bbYou must bring to Jerusalem the first and second year’s tithes which you withheld, and confess, ‘I have divested my home of the sacred produce’ as specified in “When you have finished tithing.” @p11@p2<EN>At the end of seven years.@p3 Perhaps seven years for each and every loan? The Torah therefore teaches, “The seventh year is approaching.” If you say that there are seven years for each and every loan? for everyone’s loan, how is it that it is approaching? This teaches that the seven years follow the count of the @ITshemitah@it cycle. @p12@p2<EN>Suspend every creditor’s hand.@p3 Suspend the hand @rr°@bbof every creditor. @p13@p2<EN>You should demand payment from the stranger. @p3 This is a positive commandment. @p14@p2<EN>End it [poverty], so that there will be no one destitute among you.@p3 Yet elsewhere it is said, “For the destitute will never cease.” But, whenever you fulfill the will of God, there will be destitute among others, but not among you; whenever you fail to fulfill the will of God, there will be destitute among you. @d1Destitute.@d2 [This refers to someone] poorer than @hh<HEB>עָנִי@ee<ENG>, “indigent.” The word @hh<HEB>אֶבְיוֹן@ee<ENG> denotes someone desirous of everything. @p15@p2<EN>Only if you listen.@p3 @rr°@bbThen, there will be no one destitute among you. @d1You listen [lit., “listen you listen”].@d2 @rr°@bbListen a little, and you will be given the opportunity to listen much.<QC>
@p16@p2<EN>Just as He told you.@p3 Where did He tell you? “You are blessed in the city.” @d1You will grant loans.@d2 Whenever a word denoting lending is used in reference to the lender, the usage is causative, “you will grant loans.” But if it had said @hh<HEB>וְעָבַעְתָּ@ee<ENG>, then it would refer to the borrower, as in “you will borrow.” @d1You will grant loans to nations.@d2 Perhaps you will borrow from one and lend to another? The Torah therefore teaches, “but you will not borrow.” @d1You will rule over many nations.@d2 Perhaps other nations will rule over you? The Torah therefore teaches, “but they will not rule over you.” @p17@p2<EN>If there should be someone destitute in your midst.@p3 @rr°@bbThe neediest should be given preference. @d1Among one of your brothers.@d2 @rr°@bbYour paternal brother should be given preference over your maternal brother. @d1Your cities.@d2 The indgent of your city should be given preference over the indigent of a different city. @d1Do not harden.@d2 Some people agonize over whether to give or not; the Torah therefore says, “Do not harden.” Some people open the hand, then close it; the Torah therefore says, “Do not close.” @d1Against your destitute brother.@d2 If you do not give him, you will eventually become a brother of the destitute. @p18@p2<EN>You must surely open.@d2 [lit. “Open, you must open] Even repeatedly. @d1Rather, you must surely open.@d2 @hh<HEB>כִּי@ee<ENG> here is understood as “rather.”<QC>

@d1Saying.@d2 @rr°@bbI am counselling you for your own good. @d1To your brother, to your indigent.@d2 To which brother? To the indigent. @d1To your indigent.@d2 With one @ITyud@it meaning a single indigent. However, “your indigent” with two @ITyuds@it refers to two of the indigents. @p112@p2<EN>If .<TIE>.<TIE>. is sold to you.@p3 Through others. @rr°@bbWhen the courts sold him for his larceny, is Scripture’s subject here. But it is already said, “If you purchase a Hebrew slave,” and Scripture there refers to a sale by the courts. @rr°@bbRather, because of two novel teachings here. One, it is written “Or a Hebrew woman” — she must also be liberated after six years. But not a woman sold by the courts, since women are not sold for larceny, as it is said, “For ‘his’ larceny” — not for her larceny. Rather, a minor sold by her father. This teaches that if six years elapsed before she reached puberty, she must be liberated. Another novel teaching here is “you must surely present him with a severance bonus.” @p114@p2<EN>You must surely present him with a severance bonus.@p3 @rr°@bbThe literal meaning of this is “adornment,” to be held high and viewed. An object which indicates that you treated him benevolently. Some explain that the word refers to a necklace worn around the throat. @d1From your flocks, your threshing area, and your wine cellar.@d2 Perhaps only from these alone? The Torah therefore teaches, “with which .<TIE>.<TIE>. blessed you.” From everything with which your Creator blessed you. Why are [only] these mentioned? @rr°@bbJust as these are distinguished by their blessed status, so do we include everything categorized as blessed. This excludes mules. @rr°@bbAlso, the Rabbis derive in tractate Kidushin, through the @ITgezerah shava@it-word comparison principle, the amount which must be given to him from each species. @p115@p2<EN>Remember that you were a slave.@p3 And I bestowed a parting gift and repeated it with the spoils of Egypt and [then] the spoils of the sea. You, as well, should bestow a severance gift and then repeat it. @p117@p2<EN>Perpetual slave.@p3 @rr°@bbPerhaps this follows the plain meaning? The Torah therefore teaches, “Return, everyone, to his ancestral property, everyone shall return to his family.” This teaches that the reference here is merely in the perpetuity of @ITYovel.@it @d1Do the same to your maid-servant as well.@d2 Bestow the severance bonus upon her. Perhaps even with the piercing [of the ear] Scripture equates her? The Torah therefore teaches. “If the slave should say.” The slave undergoes the piercing, but not the  maid-servant.<QC>
@p118@p2<EN>For, double the profit produced by the wage earner.@p3 From here it is derived that a Hebrew slave works day and night, thus producing double the work of the wage earner hired on a daily basis. What work does he do at night? @rr°@bbHis master gives him a Gentile maid-servant, and the offspring are the property of the owner. @p119@p2<EN>Every firstborn .<TIE>.<TIE>. you must consecrate.@p3 Elsewhere it is said that one should not consecrate him. How is this resolved? He may not consecrate him as a different sacrifice. Here, however, it teaches that @rr°@bbit is a @ITmitzvah@it to declare ‘You are hereby consecrated as a firstborn.’ @rr°@bbAnother interpretation. One cannot say “You must consecrate”! since it has already been said. “Do not consecrate”! And one cannot say “Do not consecrate”! since it has already been said, “You must consecrate”! How is this resolved? You may consecrate it whereby its monetary value becomes sacred, @rr°@bbthen donate, to the sacred @IThekdesh@it domain, the value of its beneficiary payment. @d1You may not work with your first-born ox, or shear, etc.@d2 The converse, as well, is prohibited by Rabbinic derivation, but Scripture depicts what is commonly practiced. @p120@p2<EN>Before Adonoy your God, you must eat it.@p3 This is addressed to the @ITkohein@it, as we already find that this is one of the priestly gifts, whether sound or blemished, as it is said, “Their flesh shall be yours, etc.” @d1Each year.@d2 This teaches that it should not be detained for more than a year. Perhaps it becomes disqualified once the year had passed? It has already been compared to the tithe, as it is said, “You must eat, before Adonoy your God, etc., the tithe of your grain, wine, and oil, and the first-born of your cattle and flocks.” @rr°@bbJust as the second tithe is not disqualified from one year to the next, so is the first-born not disqualified. Rather, it is a @ITmitzvah@it within the year. @d1Each year [lit. year by year].@d2 If it was slaughtered at the end of the year, it may be eaten that day, and another day into the following year. This teaches that it may be eaten for two days and a night. @p121@p2<EN>A blemish.@p3 This is a general statement. @d1If it is crippled or blind.@d2 This is specific. @d1Any severe blemish.@d2 This returns to the general. Just as the specific statement refers explicitly to a visible permanent blemish, so must every disqualifying blemish be visible and permanent. @p123@p2<EN>Only, do not eat its blood.@p3 In order that you do not say that, as the entire animal is permitted by exemption from a generally prohibited category — since it is sacred, yet may be slaughtered outside the sanctuary without redemption and eaten — then perhaps even its blood is permitted. The Torah therefore teaches “Only do not eat its blood.” @p11@p2<EN>Take heed of the month of spring.@p3 Before it arrives. Take heed that it is compatible with springtime, so that you may bring the @ITomer-mincha@it-<FJ> offering. If not, add a month to the year. @d1From Egypt at night.@d2 But didn’t they leave by day, as it is said, “On the day after the pascal-offering, the Israelites went out, etc.”? But, because it was at night that Pharoah granted them permission to leave, as it is said, “He called for Moshe and Aharon at night, etc.”<QC>
@p12@p2<EN>You shall slaughter the @BIpesach@BO-offering to Adonoy your God; flocks.@p3 As it is said, “You shall take it from the sheep and goats.” @d1And cattle.@d2 @rr°@bbYou shall slaughter, as the @ITchagigah@it-offering. If those engaged as partners in the @ITpesach@it were a large group, they must bring, with it, a @ITchagigah@it-offering, so that it is eaten when they have filled themselves. In addition, the Rabbis derive many teachings from this passage. @p13@p2<EN>Bread of anguish.@p3 @rr°@bbBread which memorializes the anguish they suffered in Egypt. @d1Since in haste you left.@d2 @rr°@bbWithout sufficient time for the dough to leaven. This will serve as a memorial. The haste was not yours, but Egypt’s, as it is said, “The Egyptians pressed the people, etc.” @d1So that you remember.@d2 By eating the @ITpesach@it and @ITmatzah,@it the day of your departure. @p14@p2<EN>None of the flesh may remain —@d2 which you slaughter towards evening of the first day — @BOuntil morning.@d2 @rr°@bbThis prohibits retaining the flesh of the @ITpesach@it offered during future generations, since this was previously stated only with regard to the @ITpesach@it brought in Egypt. @rr°@bbThe “first day” mentioned here refers to the fourteenth of Nisan, as it is said, “But before the first day you must remove all leaven from your homes.” @rr°@bbBecause Scripture has digressed from matters concerning the @ITpesach,@it and entered a discussion of the laws of the seven days — for example, “For seven days, are you to eat on it @ITmatzos@it,” “No sourdough of yours may be seen in all of your boundary” — it is now necessary to identify the slaughter to which this admonition is directed. For, if it had written, “None of the flesh which you slaughter towards evening may remain until morning,” one might have concluded that @ITshelamim@it-offerings slaughtered throughout the entire seven day period are included in “do not allow to remain,” and thus may be eaten for only a day and a night. Scripture, therefore, specifies “towards evening ‘of the first day.”’ Another interpretation. To the @ITchagigah@it-offering of the fourteenth, is Scripture’s reference, teaching that it may be eaten for two days. And “the first” mentioned here is Scripture’s reference to the first day of the festival. This is the sense of the passage: ‘The flesh of the @ITchagigah@it which you slaughter towards evening may not remain overnight during the first day of the festival until the morning of the second; however, it may be eaten on the fourteenth and fifteenth.’ This is the way it is taught in tractate Pesachim.<QC>
@p16@p2<EN>Towards evening, at sunset, at the time you left Egypt.@p3 @rr°@bbThese are three separate times. Towards evening — after six hours — slaughter it. At sunset — eat it. At the time you left [Egypt] — you burn it, meaning that it is disqualified as @ITnosar,@it and must be removed to the burning site. @p17@p2<EN>You shall cook.@p3 The reference is to roasting over an open fire. This, too, is described as cooking. @d1You may depart in the morning.@d2 @rr°@bbThe morning of the second day. This teaches that one is required to remain overnight, to include the night after the festival.<QC>
@p18@p2<EN>For six days you shall eat @BImatzos.@p3 @rr°@bbElsewhere it is said seven days. @rr°@bbSeven from the old crop, six from the new. @rr°@bbAnother interpretation. This teaches that eating @ITmatzoh@it on the seventh day is not obligatory. You learn from this, and apply it to all six days; For, the seventh was included in a general group, and then isolated, with the teaching that eating @ITmatzah@it then is not obligatory, but arbitrary. It was not isolated strictly for itself, but as an example for the entire group. Just as the seventh day is arbitrary, so are all the days arbitrary, except for the first evening, which Scripture designates as obligatory, as it is said, “In the evening you shall eat matzos.” @d1[Is one of] withdrawal for the sake of Adonoy your God.@d2 Withdraw from working. Another interpretation. A gathering for celebrating with food and drink, as in “Please, let us gather you up.” @p19@p2<EN>From the time the sickle begins felling the standing grain.@p3 @rr°@bbFrom the time the @ITomer@it is cut, which begins the harvest. @p110@p2<EN>The fullness of your open-handed gift.@p3 @rr°@bbThe fullness of the gift of your hand, wholly commensurate with the blessing. Bring @ITshelamim@it-offerings of rejoicing, and invite guests for feasting. @p111@p2<EN>The Levite, proselyte, orphan, and widow.@p3 My four correspond with your four — your son, daughter, servant, and maid-servant. If you bring joy to Mine, I shall bring joy to yours.<QC>
@p112@p2<EN>Remember that you were a slave, etc.@p3 I redeemed you with thr stipulation that you observe and fulfill these statutes. @p113@p2<EN>When you harvest.@p3 At harvest time, when you place the summer produce in storage. @rr°@bbAnother interpretation of when you harvest your threshing area and wine cellar. This teaches that the @ITsukkah@it should be covered with the husks and skins left in the threshing area and wine cellar.<QC>
@p115@p2<EN>You shall experience pure joy.@p3 According to its plain meaning, this is not a command, but an assurance. According to the Talmudic teaching, however, it is derived from here that @rr°@bbthe last evening of the festival is included in the @ITmitzvah@it to rejoice.<QC>
@p116@p2<EN>He shall not appear empty handed in the presence of Adonoy.@p3 @rr°@bbRather, bring @ITolah@it-pilgrimage-offerings and festive @ITshelamim@it-offerings. @p117@p2<EN>Everyone according to the gift appropriate to his means.@p3 Someone who has numerous guests and great affluence should bring many @ITolah-@it and @ITshelamim@it-offerings.<QC>
@p118@p2<EN>Judges and police officers.@p3 Judges: Magistrates who render legal decisions. Police officers — who compel the people to abide by their instructions @rr°@bbby administering corporal punishment with cudgels and whips, until they accept the judge’s decision. @d1In all of your cities.@d2 @rr°@bbIn each and every city. @d1For your tribes.@d2 @rr°@bbThis continues from ‘You shall appoint for yourself’ — “Judges and police officers you shall appoint for yourself for your tribes, in all of your cities which Adonoy, your God, is giving you.” @d1For your tribes.@d2 @rr°@bbThis teaches that judges are to be seated for each and every tribe and in each and every city. @d1Who will judge the people, etc.@d2 @rr°@bbAppoint competent, righteous judges, to judge righteously.<QC>
@p119@p2<EN>Do not pervert justice.@p3 This follows the obvious interpretation. @d1Do not display favoritism.@d2 @rr°@bbNot even during the arguments. This prohibits the judge from being gentle with one but harsh with the other, or from requiring one to stand while the other is seated; because when one notices the judge deferring to his fellow, his arguments are repressed. @d1Do not accept bribery.@d2 @rr°@bbEven to adjudicate fairly. @d1For bribery blinds.@d2 @rr°@bbOnce he has accepted his bribe, it is impossible for him not to be partial, and subvert the verdict in his favor. @d1Words that are just.@d2 @rr°@bbWords that are justified, true justice. @p120@p2<EN>Pursue absolute justice.@p3 @rr°@bbFollow after the pre-eminent tribunal. @d1So that you may live and inherit.@d2 @rr°@bbThere is adequate merit in the appointment of ethical judges to bring life to the Israelites, and settle them on their land. @p121@p2<EN>Do not plant an @BIAsherah@BO tree for yourself.@p3 @rr°@bbThis makes him liable from the time that it was planted. Even if he never worshipped it, he transgresses a negative commandment for the very planting. @d1Do not plant an @ITAsherah@it tree for yourself; any tree near the altar of Adonoy, your God. @rr°@bbThis prohibits planting a tree @rr°@bbor building a structure on the Temple mount. @p122@p2<EN>Do not erect for yourself a monument.@p3 A single-stone monument @rr°@bbfor sacrificial offerings, even for the sake of Heaven. @d1That [God] detests.@d2 An altar made of stones or @rr°@bban earthen altar is what He commanded, but He detests this, @rr°@bbbecause it was in the canon of the Canaanites. Although He cherished it during the times of the patriarchs, He now detests it, since they included it in the idolatrous ritual. @p11@p2<EN>Do not sacrifice, etc., anything bad.@p3 @rr°@bbThis prohibits causing the @ITpigul@it disqualification of the sacred offerings through a pernicious statement.

He had hardly completed the @ITolah@it-offering, when Shmuel arrived, and told him, “You have been foolish!

Sifrei expounds: @p12@p2<EN>But he will have no territory@p3 — @rr°@bbthis refers to the inheritance of the remaining ones. ‘Among his brothers’ — this refers to the inheritance of five. I do not know what this means. But it seems to me that the Canaanite territory across the Yardein and onward is entitled ‘The land of five nations;’ that of Sichon and Og, ‘Two nations,’ the Emorites and Canaanites; @rr°@bband ‘the inheritance of the remaining ones’ adds that of the Keinites, Kenizites, and Kadmonites. A similar exposition is made in the portion of the Torah concerning gifts disclosed to Aharon, “Therefore, Levi did not have, etc.” — this prohibits [the territory of] the Keini, Kenizi, and Kadmoni. Afterward, I found in R’ Klonimus’ commentary, that the text of Sifrei is as follows: @rr°@bb“‘But he will have no territory’ — this refers to the inheritance of five. @d1Among his brothers.@d2 This refers to the inheritance of seven.” The inheritance of five tribes, and the inheritance of seven tribes. Because Moshe and Yehoshua did not appropriate and inheritance except that of the five tribes alone — for Moshe appropriated the portions of Reuvein, Gad and half the tribe of Menashe. Yehoshua appropriated the portions of Yehudah, Efrayim, and half the tribe of Menashe, and the seven others took possession by themselves, after Yehoshua’s demise — because of this, he mentions five separately, and seven separately. @d1As He said to him.@d2 “You shall not inherit their land, etc., I am your portion.” @p13@p2<EN>From the people.@p3 @rr°@bbBut not from the @ITkohanim.@it @d1Whether an ox or a sheep.@d2 @rr°@bbThis excludes wild animals. @d1The foreleg.@d2 @rr°@bbFrom the carpus to the shoulder blade, @ITespaldon@it in Old French. @d1The jaw.@d2 @rr°@bbIncluding the tongue. @rr°@bbThose expounding Scriptural selections remarked that @rr°@bbthe foreleg represents the hand, as it is said, ‘He grasped a spear in his hand’; the jaw represents prayer, as it is said, ‘Pinchas stood and prayed;’ and the [fourth] stomach represents ‘[He pierced] .<TIE>.<TIE>. the woman in her genital area.’ @p14@p2<EN>The first portion of your grain.@p3 This refers to the @ITterumah@it-gift. No amount is specified. The Rabbis, however, established specific amounts. The generous gift: one fortieth of the total crop. The minimal gift: one sixtieth. The standard gift: one fiftieth. They found Scriptural support for the minimal amount of one sixtieth, as it is said, “Give @rr°@bbone sixth of an @ITeiphah@it @rr°@bbfrom a @ITchomer@it of barley.” Now one sixth of an @ITeiphah@it is half a @ITse’ah.@it If one gives half a @ITse’ah@it from a @ITkur@it, the resulting amount is one sixtieth, since the @ITkur@it is comprised of thirty @ITse’ahs.@it @d1And the first of the shearing of your sheep.@d2 @rr°@bbWhen you shear your sheep every year, give the first of it to the @ITkohein.@it No amount is specified, but the Rabbis established a specific amount: one sixtieth. How many sheep cause the first shearing obligation? Five ewes, @rr°@bbas it is said, “Five sheep which cause [the first shearing obligation].” R’ Akiva said, “The first shearing” — two. “of your sheep” — four. “you shall give him” — five. @p15@p2<EN>To stand and perform the service.@p3 This teaches that the service may be performed only while standing. @p16@p2<EN>If a Levite should come.@p3 @rr°@bbPerhaps it is literally to the Levite that Scripture refers? The Torah therefore teaches “He shall perform the service” this excludes the Levites, who are not permitted to perform the services. @d1Coming with all his soul’s desire. @p17@p2<EN>He shall perform the service.@p3 @rr°@bbThis teaches, concerning the @ITkohein,@it that he is permitted to come and offer up his personal voluntary or obligatory sacrifices, even during a watch which is not his own. @rr°@bbAnother interpretation. This teaches, further, that the @ITkohanim@it who came during the festival @rr°@bb[were permitted] to bring offerings with the ministering watch, by performing the sacrificial services with the offerings @rr°@bbwhich were brought because of the festival obligation — for example, the festival @ITmusaf@it-offerings — although the watch was not their own. @p18@p2<EN>They shall eat equal portions.@p3 This teaches @rr°@bbthat they share in the skins, and in the flesh of the sin-offering goats. Perhaps even in the offerings unrelated to the festival — for example, the constant @ITtamid@it and Shabbos @ITmusaf@it-offerings, and the endowment and gift-offerings? The Torah therefore teaches, except for what the families sold [to one another], with the exception of the matters [included] in the ancestral exchange, during the time of Dovid and Shmuel, when the watches were established. They exchanged with each other — ‘Take your Shabbos, and I will take my Shabbos.’ @p19@p2<EN>Do not learn to perpetrate.@p3 ‘But you may learn to understand and instruct.’ This means, to understand how corrupt their activities are, and to instruct your children, ‘Do not do this, as this is the custom of the Gentiles.’ @p110@p2<EN>Anyone who passes his son or daughter through fire.@p3 This is the way “Molech” was worshipped.

They have already been instructed: @rr°@bbIf he attempts to divert you from any one of the commandments, “Do not listen to him”; unless he has been established in your estimation as a perfect saint, as, for example, Eliyahu on Mount Carmel, who offered a sacrifice on an extra-Sanctuary altar when such altars were prohibited, in order to create a restrictive enclosure around Yisroel — strictly as befitting the need of the moment, so that the breach [in Torah observance] may be contained. @rr°@bbThis is why it is stated, “You shall obey him.” @d1Do not fear him.@d2 Do not refrain from finding him guilty. @rr°@bbDo not fear punishment because of him. @p13@p2<EN>Ready the route.@p3 Refuge!

@p111@p2<EN>If there is a man who hates his neighbor.@p3 Because of his hatred, he will eventually stalk him. From here it is derived that if a man violates a minor offense, he will ultimately commit a grave transgression. Because he violated “Do not hate [your brother],” he ultimately committed murder. This is why it says, “If there is a man who hates his neighbor, etc.” Otherwise, it should have written, “If a man rises up, stalks his neighbor, and wounds him mortally.” @p113@p2<EN>Do not view him with compassion.@p3 @rr°@bbDo not say, the first one has already been killed. Why kill this one, and have two dead Jews? @p114@p2<EN>Do not move back the boundary.@p3 The word means the same as “They have retreated rearward.” When one moves the boundary marker rearward, into his neighbor’s property, in order to increase his own. But doesn’t it already say, “Do not steal”? Why, then, does the Torah say, “Do not move back...”? This teaches that someone who overturns his neighbor’s boundary violates two negative commandments. Perhaps this applies outside the land [of Eretz Yisroel] as well? The Torah therefore teaches, “in your hereditary property which you inherit, etc.” In Eretz Yisroel one violates two commandments, but outside [Eretz Yisroel,] one violates only “Do not steal.” @p115@p2<EN>One witness.@p3 @rr°@bbThis establishes a source construct: Wherever “witness” is mentioned in the Torah, the reference is to two, unless specified as one.<QC>

How is this? When other witnesses said to them, ‘But weren’t you with us on that day at another location?!’ @p117@p2<EN>The two men shall stand.@p3 @rr°@bbOur passage refers to the witnesses. This teaches that women cannot testify, and that the witnesses must testify while standing. @d1Who are involved in the dispute.@d2 @rr°@bbThis refers to the litigants.<QC>
@d1Before Adonoy.@d2 It should seem to them, as if they stand before the Omnipresent, as it is said, “He [God] judges in the midst of judges.” @d1Who are in those days.@d2 Yiftach, in his generation, is like Shmuel in his generation — you must treat him reverently. @p118@p2<EN>The judges shall investigate thoroughly.@p3 @rr°@bbThis is directed at those asserting that the witnesses were conspirators. They shall investigate and interrogate those accusing them of conspiracy, by the prescribed method of investigation and interrogation.<QC>
@d1Behold, the witness testified falsely.@d2 @rr°@bbWherever “witness” is mentioned, Scripture refers to two. @p119@p2<EN>As he conspired.@p3 But not as he did. @rr°@bbFrom here it is derived that if the execution was carried out, the witnesses are not executed. @d1To do to his brother.@d2 What does the Torah teach with “to his brother”? It teaches that witnesses who conspired against the daughter of a @ITkohein@it who was married are not executed by burning, but by the method of execution of the adulterer, which is asphyxiation, as it is said, “She .<TIE>.<TIE>. shall be burned by fire” — she, but not the adulterer. This is why “to his brother” is said here — “as he conspired to do to his brother,” but not as he conspired to do to his sister. However, with all the other executions, the Torah likens women to men, and conspirators against a woman are executed as are conspirators against a man. For example, if they testified that she committed murder or desecrated Shabbos, they are executed by the same method as she would have been. For “his sister” is not excluded here @rr°@bbexcept where the punishment for conspiracy may be fulfilled with the adulter’s [type of] execution. @p120@p2<EN>Will hear and be fearful.@p3 @rr°@bbFrom here we derive that there must be a proclamation, ‘So and so were executed for conspiratorial testimony in court.’ @p121@p2<EN>Eye for eye.@p3 @rr°@bbMonetary payment. Similarly, “tooth for tooth, etc.” @p11@p2<EN>When you go to war.@p3 @rr°@bbScripture positioned going to war here to teach that anyone lacking a body member is not qualified to go to war. @rr°@bbAnother interpretation. To teach that if you judge righteously, you will be assured when you go to war, that you will be victorious. Similarly, Dovid said, “I have acted justly and righteously — Do not abandon me to those who would dispossess me.” @d1Against your enemy.@d2 @rr°@bbConsider them enemies. @rr°@bbDo not pity them, for they will not pity you. @d1Horse and chariot.@d2 In My eyes, they are all like a single horse.

@p13@p2<EN>Hear, Yisroel.@p3 Even if you have no merit @rr°@bbother than the reading of the Shema alone, you are worthy of being saved. @d1Against your enemies.@d2 These are not your brothers. If you fall into their hands, @rr°@bbthey will be merciless towards you. This is not the same as the war between Yehudah and Yisroel, where it is said, “The men whose names were specified arose and took hold of the captives; All those who were naked, they clothed from the spoils. They clothed them, gave them shoes, fed them, gave them drinks, anointed them with oil, and led on donkeys those who were weak. They brought them to Yereicho, the city of dates, near their brothers. Then they returned to Shomron.” Rather, you are proceeding towards your enemies. Therefore, be strong for the battle. @d1Do not be faint hearted or intimidated; do not panic or be crushed.@d2 Four prohibitions, corresponding with the four things @rr°@bbthe Gentile monarchs do. They fasten their armor plates so that they strike each other and produce a clamor which terrorizes their opponents into fleeing; they tramp heavily with their horses and goad them into a frenzy so that the pounding of the horses’ hoofbeats is heard; they utter screams and blow horns and other noise makers. @d1Do not be faint hearted.@d2 @rr°@bbFrom the horses’ neighing. @d1Do not be intimidated.@d2 From the fastening of the armor. @d1Do not panic.@d2 From the noise of the horns. @d1Do not be crushed.@d2 From the sounds of screaming. @p14@p2<EN>For Adonoy your God.@p3 They advance by mortal triumph, whereas you advance by the triumph of the Omnipresent.

Because this is to be added to the words of the @ITkohein.@it The @ITkohein@it delivers the address and announces from “Hear Yisroel” until “to save you.” “Is there a man,” then the second, and then the third, the @ITkohein@it addresses and an officer announces. With our passage, an officer addresses and another officer announces. @d1Who is afraid, or faint hearted.@d2 R’ Akiva said, as the plain meaning indicates — he cannot maintain himself in the battle mode, where he must face the menacing sword. @rr°@bbR’ Yosi Hagalili said, one who is afraid because of his transgressions. The reason the Torah provides the pretext of returning because of one’s house or vineyard or wife is to protect those who return because of their transgressions — so that no one realizes that they are transgressors. Those who notice their return will say, ‘Perhaps he built a house, or planted a vineyard, or took a wife.’ @p19@p2<EN>Army commanders.@p3 To station disciplinary officers at the front and to the rear, carrying iron spears. If anyone attempts to retreat, they are empowered to cut off their legs. “Disciplinary officers,” lit. “those who lift up” — men who are stationed at the edge of the battlefield to “lift up” those who falter, and encourage them by saying, ‘Get back to the battle, @rr°@bbdo not run away!

@p110@p2<EN>If you should go to war.@p3 Optional warfare is Scripture’s subject; @rr°@bbfor, with regard to the war for Eretz Yisroel, it would be inappropriate to say, “and you capture prisoner from them,” since it has already said, “Do not allow a soul to remain alive.” @d1And you capture prisoners from them.@d2 @rr°@bbThis includes the Canaanites among them, although they are members of the seven nations.<QC>
@p111@p2<EN>You may take her as your wife.@p3 The Torah speaks @rr°@bbonly in deference to the wicked inclination, for if the Holy One, blessed is He, would not permit her, he would live with her illicitly. However, if he does marry her, he will ultimately hate her, as it is further said, “If a man has, etc.” And, ultimately, he will father, from her, a wayward, rebellious son. This is why these chapters adjoin one another. @d1A wife.@d2 @rr°@bbEven someone’s wife.<QC>
@p112@p2<EN>And allow her nails to grow.@p3 @rr°@bbShe must allow them to grow so that she becomes ugly. @p113@p2<EN>She must discard her prisoner’s garb.@p3 @rr°@bbAs they are attractive, since the young Gentile women beautify themselves during warfare, to invite promiscuous behaviour with them. @d1And she will remain in your home.@d2 @rr°@bbIn the home he makes use of. He enters and stumbles over her, leaves and stumbles over her, notices her weeping and disgrace, so that she becomes repulsive to him. @d1And weep for her father.@d2 @rr°@bbWhy to such an extent? So that the Israelite daughter may be joyous, while this one is melancholy; the Israelite daughter may beautify herself, while this one becomes ugly. @p114@p2<EN>But it shall come to pass, that if you do not desire her.@p3 @rr°@bbScripture informs you that you will ultimately hate her. @d1You may not exploit her.@d2 You may not utilize her. In the Persian language, servitude and utilization is verbalized as @ITimra’ah.@it From the commentary of R’ Moshe Hadarshan I have learned this. @p117@p2<EN>Doublefold.@p3 @rr°@bbEquivalent to two brothers. @d1Of all that he possesses.@d2 From here [we derive] that the firstborn @rr°@bbdoes not inherit doublefold of receivables due after the father’s death, as he does of property in his possession.<QC>
@p118@p2<EN>Wayward.@p3 Who strays from the path. @d1And rebellious.@d2 Who rebels against his father’s instructions. The word means the same as “rebels.” @d1Though they chasten him.@d2 @rr°@bbThey warn him before three [magistrates] and have him flogged. The wayward, rebellious son is not liable unless he steals @rr°@bband consumes a @ITtartamor@it of meat, and drinks half a @ITlog@it of wine, as it is said, “gluttonous and drunken,” and it is said, @rr°@bb”Do not be among the wine guzzlers, among those who gluttonously consume meat for themselves.” The wayward, rebellious son is executed in consideration of his ignoble end. The Torah penetrates to the logical conclusion of his thought — ultimately, he will squander his father’s fortune, attempt to apply himself to his studies and fail, @rr°@bbstation himself near an intersection and plunder his fellow creatures; the Torah declares: Let him die in innocence rather than die laden with guilt.<QC>
@p121@p2<EN>Let all Yisroel hear and be fearful.@p3 @rr°@bbFrom here [we derive] that there must be a proclamation at the courthouse: ‘So-and-so was stoned for having been a wayward, rebellious son’!<QL>
@p122@p2<EN>If a man is guilty of a capital offense.@p3 The proximity of the chapters teaches that if his mother and father take pity on him, he will ultimately develop into a degenerate, commit transgressions, and be sentenced to death by the courts. @d1You shall hang him from a tree.@d2 @rr°@bbThe Rabbis remark that all those who are stoned are also hung, for it is said, “for a hanging corpse is an affront to God,” and someone who curses God is stoned. @p123@p2<EN>For a hanging corpse is an affront to God.@p3 @rr°@bbIt is an affront to the king, for man is fashioned in His image, @rr°@bband the Israelites are His children. This is compared to twin brothers who were identical to each other. One became king, and one was apprehended as a thief and hanged. Everyone who saw him exclaimed, ‘The king has been hanged!’ [The king issued a command, and he was brought down.] @hh<HEB>קְלָלָה@ee<ENG> throughout Scripture connotes slighting and insult, as in, “He insulted me explicitly.” @p11@p2<EN>And conceal yourself.@p3 @rr°@bbAvert your eyes as if you don’t notice it.<QC>
@d1You may not observe .<TIE>.<TIE>. and conceal yourself.@d2 @rr°@bbYou may not observe it so as to conceal yourself. This is its plain meaning. @rr°@bbThe Rabbis, however, comment: At times, you may conceal yourself, etc. @p12@p2<EN>Until your brother seeks.@p3 @rr°@bbWould it seem reasonable to return it to him before he seeks it? But, rather, inquire after him, lest he is a swindler. @d1When you must return it to him.@d2 @rr°@bbProvided there is a return — but not if it eats in your home the equivalent of its value, which you then claim from him. From here, they ruled: Everything which produces and eats, shall produce and eat; @rr°@bbwhich does not produce and eat, shall be sold. @p13@p2<EN>You may not conceal yourself.@p3 @rr°@bbBy averting your eyes as if you don’t notice it. @p14@p2<EN>You must surely lift it up with him.@p3 @rr°@bbThis refers to loading — to load the cargo which fell from it. @d1With him.@d2 [With] its owner. But if he walked off and sat down, and said to him, ‘Since you were commanded, load if you will,’ he is exempt.<QC>
@p15@p2<EN>A man’s attire may not be on a woman.@p3 So that she resembles a man, in order to mingle with men — this can only be for the purpose of promiscuous behavior. @d1Nor may a man wear a woman’s garment.@d2 In order to take a place among women. Another interpretation: @rr°@bbHe may not shave the pubic hairs, or under the armpits. @d1For the abomination.@d2 @rr°@bbThe Torah prohibited only garments leading to abomination.<QC>
@p16@p2<EN>If you should chance.@p3 This excludes a nest owned beforehand. @d1Do not take the mother.@d2 @rr°@bbWhile on top of her young. @p17@p2<EN>So that you will benefit .<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 @rr°@bbIf, with an easily fulfilled commandment, involving no financial loss, the Torah declares, “So that you will benefit and live long”; then certainly with the reward for the difficult commandments. @p18@p2<EN>When you build a new home.@p3 If you fulfill the commandment of “sending from the nest,” you will ultimately build a new home and fulfill the commandment of [making] a fence, since one mitzvah engenders another mitzvah. And you will attain a vineyard, a field, and beautiful clothing. This is why these chapters adjoin each other. @d1A fence.@d2 A fence around the roof. Onkelos translates @hh<HEB>תְּיָקָא@ee<ENG>, like @hh<HEB>תִּיק@ee<ENG>, “a container,” which protects its contents. @d1For someone who should fall may fall.@d2 @rr°@bbHe deserves to fall, but still, let his death not come about through you, @rr°@bbas benefit is brought about through the meritorious, and injury through the guilty. @p19@p2<EN>Mixed species.@p3 @rr°@bbWheat, barley, and grapeseed, within a hand fling. @d1Lest .<TIE>.<TIE>. becomes obnoxious.@d2 As Targum [Onkelos] renders, “becomes obnoxious.” Anything obnoxious to a person, whether laudable, as with sacred objects, or detestable, as with forbidden objects, is described by the term “obnoxious,” as in, “Do not approach me, for I have rendered you obnoxious.” @d1The expansion.@d2 This refers to the fullness and enlargement generated by the seed.<QC>
@p110@p2<EN>You may not plow with an ox and a donkey.@p3 @rr°@bbThis applies, as well, to any two species in the universe, and applies, as well, to leading them together, harnessed as a pair, in transporting any kind of burden. @p111@p2<EN>A mixture of threads.@p3 @rr°@bbThe meaning is “a mixture.” The Rabbis interpret, combed, spun, and woven. @p112@p2<EN>Make yourself pendant threads.@p3 Even out of the @hh<HEB>כִּלְאַיִם@ee<ENG> mixture — this is why Scripture places them near each other. @p113--14@p2<EN>He has relations with her and hates her. he will ultimately .<TIE>.<TIE>. @d1berate her with calumnies.@d2 One transgression engenders another. He transgressed “Do not hate” — @rr°@bbhe will ultimately reach the point of malicious slander. @d1This woman.@d2 @rr°@bbWe derive from here that no statement may be made except in the presence of the defendant.<QC>
@p115@p2<EN>The girl’s father and mother.@p3 @rr°@bbThose who nurtured the evil branch must suffer humiliation over it. @p116@p2<EN>The girl’s father should assert.@p3 @rr°@bbThis teaches that a woman is not permitted to speak before a man.<QC>
@p117@p2<EN>Let them spread the cloth.@p3 @rr°@bbThis is figurative — the matter is as clearcut as a cloth. @p118@p2<EN>And chastise him.@p3 @rr°@bbFlogging.<QC>
@p120@p2<EN>However, if the allegation is true.@p3 @rr°@bbThrough witnesses, and with a pre-warning, that she committed adultery after her @hh<HEB>אֵירוּסִין@ee<ENG> — marriage. @p121@p2<EN>To the entrance of her father’s home.@p3 Look at the branch you nurtured. @d1The people of her city.@d2 @rr°@bbIn the presence of all the people of her city. @d1Behaving promiscuously [in] her father’s house.@d2 As if it had said “in” her father’s house.<QC>
@p122@p2<EN>Even both of them shall die.@p3 @rr°@bbThis excludes lascivious activity from which the woman does not derive pleasure. @d1Even.@d2 @rr°@bbThis adds those following them. (Another version of Rashi’s text: “those committing sodomy.”) @rr°@bbAnother interpretation: “Even both of them” @rr°@bbadds the fetus — if she was pregnant, we do not wait until she gives birth. @p123@p2<EN>And a man encounters her in the city.@p3 This is why he was intimate with her — the breach summons the thief. But if she had remained at home, this would not have occurred to her. @p126@p2<EN>For, just as if a man rises up, etc.@p3 According to the plain interpretation, this is its meaning; ‘For she was coerced, he overpowered her, similar to a man who rises up against his fellow murderously.’ Our Sages expound, here, @rr°@bb‘This appears to teach, but subsequently learns, etc.’<QC>
@p11@p2<EN>A man may not marry.@p3 @rr°@bbHe cannot effect marriage with her — marriage with her is legally invalid. @d1And may not expose the edge of his father’s garment.@d2 @rr°@bbHis father’s prospective levirate partner, appropriate for his father. But he was already warned concerning her, from “the nakedness of your father’s brother.” @rr°@bbEvidently, to transgress, with her, against two prohibitions, and to place, next to her, “the bastard may not enter,” @rr°@bbto teach that the bastard is only [someone born] of those liable to @ITkares@it excision; certainly judicial execution, @rr°@bbas no act of incest or adultery subject to judicial execution is exempt from @ITkares@it excision. @p12@p2<EN>With injured or crushed.@p3 @rr°@bbWhose testicles were injured or crushed. @d1Or with a gash causing spilling.@d2 The organ was gashed, and no longer ejects a stream of semen, but spills and dribbles, and is sterile. @p13@p2<EN>A base-born may not enter into Adonoy’s community.@p3 @rr°@bbHe may not marry an Israelite woman. @p14@p2<EN>An Ammonite may not enter.@p3 @rr°@bbHe may not marry an Israelite woman.<QC>
@p15@p2<EN>Because of the matter.@p3 @rr°@bbBecause of their advice concerning you, to incite you to sin [as written in the affair of Bilam]. @d1On the way.@d2 When you were harried. @p17@p2<EN>Do not pursue their peace.@p3 By inference from what is said, “He may remain with you, in your midst,” @rr°@bbperhaps this one as well? The Torah therefore teaches, “Do not pursue their peace.” @p18@p2<EN>Do not despise the Edomite.@p3 @rr°@bbCompletely, although it would be appropriate for you to despise him, as he advanced towards you with the sword. @d1Do not despise the Egyptian.@d2 @rr°@bbTotally, although they hurled your males into the river. @rr°@bbWhat is the reason? Because they received you hospitably during a time of need. Therefore: @p19@p2<EN>Children who will be born to them in the third generation, etc.@d2 @rr°@bbThe other nations, however, are permitted immediately. Thus we learn that @rr°@bbsomeone who incites a man to sin is worse than someone who murders him. For the one who murders him, murders him in this world, while the one who incites him to sin, drives him out of this world and the World to Come. Therefore, Edom, who advanced towards them with the sword, is not to be despised. Similarly Egypt, which drowned them. These, however, who incited them to sin, are despicable.<QC>
@p110@p2<EN>When you go out .<TIE>.<TIE>. take precautions.@p3 As Satan incriminates in times of peril. @p111@p2<EN>A nocturnal incident.@p3 <NHS><NHS>@rr°@bbScriptural law is expressed in common circumstances. @d1He must go out of the camp.@d2 This is a positive commandment. @d1He may not enter into the midst of the camp.@d2 This is a negative commandment. @rr°@bbHe is not permitted to enter the camp of the Levites, certainly not the camp of the @ITShechinah.@it @p112@p2<EN>As sunset nears.@p3 Close to the setting of the sun, he should immerse himself, as @rr°@bbhe does not become pure without the setting of the sun.<QC>
@p113@p2<EN>Have a designated place.@p3 As Targum [Onkelos] renders, similar to “everyone at his place.” @d1Outside the camp.@d2 @rr°@bbOutside the cloud. @p114@p2<EN>In addition to your weapons.@p3 @rr°@bbAside from your other utensils. @d1Your weapons.@d2 Similar to “your instruments of force.” @p115@p2<EN>Let Him not see within you.@p3 @rr°@bb[Let] the Holy One, Blessed is He [not see] disgraceful objects. @p116@p2<EN>Do not deliver a slave.@p3 @rr°@bbAs Targum [Onkelos] renders. Another interpretation: Even a Gentile slave owned by a Jew, who fled from outside the land to Eretz Yisroel. @p118@p2<EN>There shall not be a harlot.@p3 Promiscuous, dedicated to and designated for lecherous relations. @d1And there shall not be a male prostitute.@d2 Designated for homosexual relations. Onkelos renders, ‘An Israelite woman shall not be kept by a slave,’ @rr°@bbfor she, too, engages promiscuously in lecherous intimate relations, since his marriage is ineffective with her, as they are compared to the donkey, as it is said, “Remain here with the donkey” — a people compared to the donkey. ‘And an Israelite man shall not marry a maid servant,’ for he, too, becomes a male prostitute through her, since all of their intimate relations amount to lechery, as his marriage is ineffective with her. @p119@p2<EN>A harlot’s fee.@p3 [If] he gave her a lamb as her harlot’s fee, it is disqualified as a sacrificial offering. @d1Or payment for a dog.@d2 If he exchanged a sheep for a dog. @d1Even both.@d2 @rr°@bbThis adds alterations in form, as, for example, wheat kernels ground into flour. @p120@p2<EN>You may not pay usury.@p3 @rr°@bbThis prohibits the borrower from paying interest to the lender. [Afterward, the prohibition to the lender: ‘You may not lend him your money for usury.’] @p121@p2<EN>You may pay usury to the stranger.@p3 But not to your brother. A negative commandment deduced from the positive constitutes a positive commandment — @rr°@bbso that he transgresses, for this, two negative commandments and one positive commandment.<QC>
@p122@p2<EN>Do not delay in discharging it.@p3 @rr°@bbFor three festivals. The Rabbis derive this from Scripture.<QC>
@p124@p2<EN>Keep what you have articulated and perform.@p3 @rr°@bbThis specifies a positive commandment with the negative. @p125@p2<EN>When you enter your fellow’s vineyard.@p3 @rr°@bbScripture refers to a laborer. @d1As you desire.@d2 As much as you desire. @d1To your satisfaction.@d2 But not to gorge yourself. @d1But you may not place it in your container.@d2 From here [we derive] that the Torah refers only to harvest time, when you place it into the owner’s receptacle. @rr°@bbHowever, if he enters to till or to hoe, he may not eat. @p126@p2<EN>When you enter your fellow’s standing grainstalks.@p3 @rr°@bbWith this, as well, Scripture refers to the laborer.<QC>
@p11@p2<EN>For he found in her something lecherous.@p3 @rr°@bbHe is then commanded to divorce her, and that she should not find favor in his eyes. @p12@p2<EN>To another man.@p3 @rr°@bbThis one is not like the first, as he ousted the evil woman from his home, while this one brought her in. @p13@p2<EN>If [lit. and] her last husband hates her.@p3 @rr°@bbScripture informs him that he will ultimately hate her. If not, then she will bury him, as it is said, “Or, if [the last husband] dies.” @p14@p2<EN>After having been defiled.@p3 @rr°@bbThis adds the adulteress who was secluded [with the adulterer].<QC>
@p15@p2<EN>A new wife.@p3 @rr°@bbOne that is new to him, even if she is a widow. This excludes someone who remarries his divorced wife. @d1It shall not impose itself over him.@d2 The military command. @d1In any matter.@d2 Which is needed by the army — not to supply water and food, or to repair the roads. @rr°@bbHowever, those who return from the combat formations by declaration of the @ITkohein@it — for example, one who built a home but did not inaugurate it, or betrothed a woman but did not marry her — supply water and food, and repair the roads. @d1He shall be .<TIE>.<TIE>. for his home.@d2 @rr°@bbEven for the sake of his home. If he built a home and inaugurated it, or planted a vineyard and redeemed it, he need not budge from his home for the war effort. @d1For his home.@d2 This refers to his [inaugurated] home. @d1He shall be.@d2 This adds his [redeemed] vineyard. @d1He shall bring joy.@d2 He shall cause his wife to rejoice. Targum also renders “He shall bring joy to his wife.” But one who translates, “He shall rejoice with his wife” is mistaken, for this is not the translation of @hh<HEB>וְשִׂמַּח@ee<ENG>, but of @hh<HEB>וְשָׂמַח@ee<ENG>. @p16@p2<EN>He may not secure as collateral.@p3 @rr°@bbIf he demands security from him for his debt in court, @rr°@bbhe may not secure implements of food preparation. @d1A mortar.@d2 This refers to the lower [utensil]. @d1Or pestle.@d2 This refers to the upper [utensil]. @p17@p2<EN>If a man is apprehended.@p3 @rr°@bbThrough witnesses, and after a warning. Similarly, every “apprehended” in the Torah. @d1And he exploited him.@d2 He is only liable if he uses him. @p18@p2<EN>Take precautions with the leprosy affliction.@p3 @rr°@bbSo as not to pluck the symptoms of defilement, or remove the leprous ulcer. @d1In accordance with everything that .<TIE>.<TIE>. shall instruct you.@d2 Whether to place in confinement, condemn, or purify. @p19@p2<EN>Remember what the Adonoy, your God, did to Miriam.@p3 @rr°@bbIf you intend to take precautions to avoid suffering @ITtzora’as,@it do not engage in slander.

@p112@p2<EN>Do not repose with his collateral.@p3 @rr°@bbDo not repose with his collateral in your possession. @p113@p2<EN>At sunset.@p3 If it is a night garment. If it is a day garment, return it in the morning. That is already written in “These are the laws” — “Until sunset, return it to him.” Throughout the day, return it to him, at sunset, you may take it. @d1And bless you.@d2 And even if he does not bless you, still, “It will be to your credit.” @p114@p2<EN>Do not steal from the wage earner.@p3 But isn’t it already written? Evidently, to violate, against the destitute, two negative commandments: ‘Do not steal the pay of the wage earner who is poor or destitute;’ and, against the wealthy, he has already been warned, “Do not steal from your fellow.” @d1Destitute.@d2 @rr°@bbIn want of all things. @d1Your converts.@d2 This refers to the righteous proselyte. @d1In your cities.@d2 @rr°@bbThis refers to the alien settler, who eats meat which was not ritually slaughtered. @d1Who are in your land.@d2 This is added to include rental fees for animals and tools. @p115@p2<EN>And he places his life in jeopardy for it.@p3 For these wages, he places himself in mortal danger — @rr°@bbhe climbs a wall, or suspends himself from a tree. @d1And you will have a sin.@d2 @rr°@bbRegardless, except that punishment is swiftly dispatched when someone cries out.<QC>
@p116@p2<EN>Fathers shall not be executed through sons.@p3 Through the testimony of the sons. Perhaps through the sin of the sons? It has already been said, “A man is executed by his own sin.” However, one who is not a man may die by his father’s sin — minors may die by their father’s sin, by Heavenly decree. @p117@p2<EN>Do not be devious in the judgment of the proselyte or orphan.@p3 Concerning the wealthy, he has already been warned, “Do not judge deviously.” It is repeated with the poor so that he violates two prohibitions, since it is easier to distort the judgment of the poor than that of the wealthy. Thus, he warns, and repeats the warning. @d1You may not secure as collateral.@d2 @rr°@bbNot at the time of the loan. @p118@p2<EN>Remember.@p3 On this condition I redeemed you — so that you keep my statutes even when the matter entails monetary loss. @p119@p2<EN>And you forget a sheaf.@p3 @rr°@bbBut not a heap. @rr°@bbFrom here we derive that a sheaf containing two @ITseahs@it that was forgotten is not @ITshikchah.@it @d1In the field.@d2 @rr°@bbThis is added to include forgotten standing grainstalks, some of which he forgot to reap.<QC>
@d1You may not return to take it.@d2 From here we derive that what is behind him is @ITshikchah,@it but what is before him is not @ITshikchah,@it as it is not included in “you may not return.” @d1In order that .<TIE>.<TIE>. will bless you.@d2 @rr°@bbAlthough it came into his possession unintentionally — certainly, with someone who acts intentionally. You may thus conclude that if a @ITsela@it-coin dropped from his hand and was found by a pauper who gained sustenance from it — he is blessed for it. @p120@p2<EN>You may not strip it of its glory.@p3 @rr°@bbDo not remove its glory from it. From here [we derive] that one must leave unharvested the outer edge of the tree. @d1Behind you.@d2 @rr°@bbThis refers to @ITshikchah.@it @p121@p2<EN>You may not harvest pygmy vines.@p3 If you discover pygmy vines, you may not take them. What are pygmy vines? Anything lacking the shoulder and the droplets. If it has either of them, then it belongs to the owner. I have seen in the Jerusalem Talmud, @rr°@bb‘What is the shoulder? clusters atop one another. The droplets? Those hanging down from the main stem.’<QC>
@p11@p2<EN>If a quarrel should occur.@p3 @rr°@bbThey will ultimately approach the court of justice. You may thus conclude that tranquility does not evolve from quarreling. What caused Lot to take leave of the saint? You may say, it was quarreling. @d1And they convict the villain.@d2 Perhaps everyone found liable in court is subject to flogging? The Torah therefore teaches, @rr°@bb”Should, the wicked one deserve flogging.” At times he is flogged, and at times he is not flogged. Who, then is liable to flogging? Learn from the context, “You may not muzzle an ox while it threshes” — @rr°@bba negative commandment unattached to a positive commandment. @p12@p2<EN>The judge shall incline him.@d2 This teaches that he is not flogged standing or sitting, but inclined. @d1Before him in the amount befitting his crime.@d2 @rr°@bbAnd behind him, in the amount befitting a double crime. From here it is derived that he is flogged two thirds from behind, and one third at the front. @d1With the number near.@d2 @rr°@bbThis is not vocalized @hh<HEB>בַּמִסְפָּר@ee<ENG>, indicating that it is attached, so that we read “With the number near forty,” but not with the total of forty. @rr°@bbRather, the number which concludes and completes up to forty, meaning forty minus one. @p13@p2<EN>He may not add.@p3 @rr°@bbFrom here we derive that one is forbidden to strike one’s fellow.<QC>
@d1When your brother will be slighted.@d2 He is constantly described as a criminal, but after the flogging, he is entitled “your brother.” @p14@p2<EN>You may not muzzle an ox.@p3 Scripture speaks in commonplace situations, @rr°@bbbut this applies as well to all domesticated animals, wild animals and fowl, engaged in work involving food. @rr°@bbIf so, why is the ox mentioned? To exclude man. @d1While it threshes.@d2 @rr°@bbPerhaps one may muzzle it while outside? @rr°@bbThe Torah therefore teaches, “You may not muzzle an ox,” anywhere. Then why is threshing said? To teach you: Just as threshing is, specifically, something done when the work was not complete, and with produce of the earth; so, with everything similar. This excludes milking, and cheese and butter making, since they are not products of the earth. It excludes kneading and shaping, since its work was completed for the @ITchallah@it obligation. @rr°@bbIt excludes prying apart dates and figs, since their work was completed for tithing. @p15@p2<EN>If brothers reside together.@p3 Provided they shared a concurrent residence in this world — this excludes the wife of his brother who did not share his world. @d1Together.@d2 @rr°@bbTogether in their inheritance. This excludes maternal brothers.<QC>
@d1Having no son.@d2 @rr°@bbScrutinize him — a son or daughter, a son’s son or daughter, or a daughter’s son or daughter. @p16@p2<EN>It shall be that the firstborn.@p3 @rr°@bbThe oldest brother shall perform levirate marriage with her. @d1When she is capable of bearing children.@d2 @rr°@bbThis excludes the @ITeilonis,@it who cannot bear children. @d1Shall be established in place of his deceased brother.@d2 The one who performed levirate marriage with his wife, @rr°@bbshall receive the deceased’s share in his father’s estate. @d1So that his name may not be obliterated.@d2 @rr°@bbThis excludes the wife of a eunuch, whose name is already obliterated. @p17@p2<EN>To the portal.@p3 @rr°@bbAs Targum [Onkelos] translates, “To the portal of the court of law.” @p18@p2<EN>He shall stand.@p3 While standing. @d1And declare.@d2 In the sacred language. @rr°@bbShe, too, must speak in the sacred language. @p19@p2<EN>And spit before him.@p3 @rr°@bbOn the ground. @d1Who will not build.@d2 From here we derive that someone who performed @ITchalitzah@it may not retract and perform levirate marriage, as it does not say, “Who @ITdid@it not build,” but “Who @ITwill@it not build.” Since he did not build, he may no longer build. @p110@p2<EN>It will be entitled, etc.@p3 @rr°@bbIt is a mitzvah incumbent on all those standing there to proclaim, “The divesture of the shoe.” @p111@p2<EN>If men engage in an altercation.@p3 @rr°@bbUltimately, they will come to blows, as it is said, “From his assailant.” @rr°@bbNo peace can result from altercation.<QC>
@p112@p2<EN>You shall sever her hand.@p3 Monetary payment for his humiliation, varying according to the one who caused the humiliation, and the one who suffered it.

However, from Succos and onward, he brings without reciting. @d1You, the Levi.@d2 The Levi, too, is subject to the first obligation — @rr°@bbif they planted in their cities. @d1And the proselyte in your midst — @d2 @rr°@bbwho brings without reciting, as he is unable to say, “to our forefathers.”<QC>
@p112@p2<EN>When you finish tithing all the tithes of your produce in the third year.@p3 @rr°@bbWhen you finish setting aside the tithes of the third year, designate the time for the divesture and the recitation on the eve of Pesach of the fourth year, @rr°@bbas it is said, “At the end of three years you shall remove, etc.” @rr°@bbHere, “at the end of” is said, and below, “at the end of seven years” is said, concerning @ITHakhel.@it Just as, there, [it refers to] a festival, so here, [it refers to] a festival. Perhaps, just as there [it refers to] the Succos festival, so here, [it refers to] the Succos festival? The Torah therefore teaches, ‘When you complete tithing the tithes of the third year’ — the festival during which the tithes are completed, which is Pesach, since there are many trees which are harvested after Succos. Thus, the tithes of the third [year] are completed at Pesach of the fourth [year], and if anyone delayed his tithes, Scripture requires that he divest his property of them.<QC>
@d1The year of the tithe.@d2 @rr°@bbThe year when the tithing obligation is for only one of the two tithes which were applicable during the two preceding years; during the first and second years of the @ITShemittah@it cycle, the obligation is for the first tithe — as it is said, “.<TIE>.<TIE>.when you take, from the Israelites, the tithe...” — and the second tithe, as it is said, “You shall eat, before Adonoy your God, the tithe of your grain, wine, and oil.” Hence, there are two tithes. Here the teaching is that, during the third year, there is an obligation only for one of those two tithes — which one? The first tithe, and in place of the second tithe, he must give the tithe for the indigent. For it is said here, “You have given to the Levi,” his due — thus, the first tithe. “To the proselyte, orphan, and widow” — this is the tithe for the indigent. @d1So that they may eat within your portals to their satisfaction.@d2 @rr°@bbSupply them with enough to satisfy them.

And it is written, “Your fully ripened produce and your @ITterumah@it gift, do not delay” — do not change the order. @d1I did not transgress Your commandments.@d2 I did not set aside the tithe @rr°@bbof one species for another, nor of the new crop for the old (or of detached fruits for those still growing, or of growing fruits for those detached). @d1Nor did I forget.@d2 @rr°@bbTo bless you for the setting aside of tithes. @p114@p2<EN>I did not eat of it when grieving.@p3 @rr°@bbFrom here we derive that it is forbidden during grief. @d1Nor did I devour it when ritually defiled.@d2 @rr°@bbWhether I was defiled and it was clean, or I was clean and it was defiled. @rr°@bbWhere is the admonition concerning this? “You may not eat in your cities” — this refers to eating during defilement, as it is said concerning disqualified sacred offerings, “You may eat it in your cities, the defiled and the clean, etc.” But this, you may not eat after the manner of the eating in your cities mentioned elsewhere. @d1Nor did I make use of it for the dead.@d2 @rr°@bbTo make a casket or shrouds. @d1I have heeded the voice of Adonoy my God.@d2 @rr°@bbI have brought it to the Temple. @d1I have fulfilled everything that You commanded me.@d2 @rr°@bbI rejoiced, and brought joy with it.<QC>

@p117@p2<EN>You have distinguished . . . He has distinguished you.@p3 There is no compelling evidence concerning these words in Scripture; but it appears to me that the word denotes setting aside, distinguishing — @rr°@bbyou have distinguished Him, from the alien gods, to be your God, @rr°@bband He set you aside, for Himself, from the peoples of the earth, to be His treasured people.

@p123@p2<EN>The heavens above your head will be like copper.@p3 @rr°@bbThese curses Moshe articulated himself, while those at Mount Sinai, by the word of God he (Moshe) pronounced them, as indicated by the text: there, @rr°@bbit is said, “If you do not heed ‘Me’.” “If you relate to ‘Me’ in a fickle way.” Here, however, it says, “to the voice of ‘Adonoy, your God’,” “‘Adonoy’ shall attach to you” “‘Adonoy’ shall strike you.” Moshe moderated his curses by expressing them in the singular form. He also moderated this curse, for in the first ones, it states, “your heavens like iron and your land like copper.” The heavens will not secrete moisture, just as iron does not secrete moisture, so that the world will subsequently suffer from drought. But the land will secrete moisture, just as copper secretes moisture, so that its produce will rot. Here, however, it says, ‘Your heavens copper and your land iron,’ the heavens will secrete moisture. Although they will not pour rain, still, there won’t be a ruinous drought in the world. And the land will not secrete moisture, just as iron does not secrete moisture, so that the produce will not rot. @rr°@bbStill, this is a curse.

Another interpretation of “God did not grant you a knowledgeable mind”; A man cannot fathom the full extent of his master’s thought, and the wisdom of his teaching, until forty years.

Until this point, my interpretation has followed the plain meaning of the text. According to Midrash Agadah: Why is the chapter of “You stand” adjacent to the imprecations? Because, when the Israelites heard nearly one hundred imprecations, besides the forty nine in @ITToras Kohanim,@it their faces blanched, and they said, ‘Who can survive these”? Moshe began soothing them. @d1You stand, this day.@d2 You have greatly angered the Omnipresent, yet He has not destroyed you, you have endured before Him. @d1This day.@d2 Like the day which endures, turning dark, but then brightening. So has He given you light, and so shall He give you light in the future; @rr°@bbwhile the imprecations and the suffering sustain you, and stand you before Him. @rr°@bbThe chapter above this, as well, is conciliatory, “You have seen everything, etc.” Another interpretation: @d1You stand.@d2 @rr°@bbBecause the Israelites were passing from one leader to the next — from Moshe to Yehoshua — therefore, he arranged, for them, a standing assembly, in order to exhort them. Yehoshua did the same, and so did Shmuel — “Stand, and I shall censure you” — when they passed from his tutelage, and entered into the tutelage of Shaul.<QC>
@p114@p2<EN>And with those who are not here.@p3 @rr°@bbEven with the generations destined for the future. @p115@p2<EN>For you are aware, etc.@p3 @rr°@bbSince you have observed the idolatrous Gentile nations, perhaps someone among you has been tempted to follow them — “Perhaps there is, among you, etc.” — therefore, I am compelled to adjure you. @p116@p2<EN>Where you observed their abominations [lit. insects].@p3 So called because they are loathsome, like insects. @d1Their loathsomeness [lit. excrement].@d2 As they are putrid and disgusting, like excrement. @d1Wood and stone.@d2 @rr°@bbThose of wood and stone, you saw in the open, as the Gentile was not apprehensive of its being stolen. However, those of silver and gold, are “with them,” in thickly panelled rooms, since they are apprehensive that they may be stolen.<QC>
@p117@p2<EN>Perhaps there is among you.@p3 @rr°@bbIn case there is, among you, @rr°@bbwhose thoughts stray today from accepting the covenant. @d1A root producing gall and bitter fruit.@d2 @rr°@bbA root nurturing bitter herbs, like the bitter @ITgidin@it herb, as if to say, producing growing evil within you. @p118@p2<EN>He will imagine self-blessings.@p3 The word denotes blessing. @rr°@bbHe will imagine blessings of tranquility for himself, saying, ‘those imprecations will never be visited on me, undivided tranquility will be mine.’ @d1Self-blessings [lit. “he will bless himself].@d2 @ITBendira sei,@it “he will bless himself,” in Old French, like “he shall shave himself,” “and involve himself in prayer.” @d1I shall follow what my thoughts envision.@d2 What my thoughts see, like, “I see it, but it is not nearby.” As if to say, whatever I envision as desirable activity. @d1So that the unintentional may be added.@d2 @rr°@bbBecause I shall punish him additionally for his unintentional acts until now, which, I have overlooked; @rr°@bbNow, however, he has provoked me into combining them with the intentionally sinful, and punishing him for everything. This, too, is Onkelos’ rendition: “In order to add, against him, the unintentional transgressions to the sinful ones” — so that I may add, against him, the unintentional to the intentionally sinful. @d1The unintentional [lit. besotted].@d2 The unintentional transgression, like a drunken deed, enacted in a stupefied state. @d1The sinful [lit. thirsty].@d2 Enacted with full knowledge and appetite. @p119@p2<EN>Adonoy’s nostrils will fume.@p3 As a result of rage, body temperature rises, and the nostrils fume. Similarly, “Fumes arise from His nostrils.” Although this does not apply to the Omnipresent, Scripture addresses the listener’s ear in the way it is accustomed, and thus capable of grasping, in accordance with worldly conditions. @d1And His vengeful fury.@d2 This denotes fury, @ITenprenment,@it @rr°@bbadherence to the vengeance mode, without quarter. @p120@p2<EN>Inscribed in this Torah scroll.@p3 But above, it says “In this Torah scroll,” “this” in the feminine gender modifies “Torah,” “this” in the masculine gender modifies “scroll.” By means of the cantillation punctuation, they are demarcated into two interpretations. In the chapter of imprecations, the @ITtipcha@it cantillation symbol is placed under “in the scroll,” so that “this” and Torah” are attached. Therefore it says “this.” Here, however, the @ITtipcha@it cantillation symbol is placed under “Torah,” so that “scroll” and “Torah” are attached. Therefore, the masculine gender follows, as the modification applies to “the scroll.” @p125@p2<EN>Unknown to them.@p3 @rr°@bbThey had no notion that they possessed Divine omnipotence. @d1Which He had not apportioned to them.@d2 He did not allot them as their portion. Onkelos, however, renders, “and who did not benefit them” — did not grant them any benefit. The sense of “Who did not apportion” is, ‘The God whom they chose did not allot to them any inheritance or portion.’ @p127@p2<EN>And Adonoy forced them away.@p3 As Targum [Onkelos] renders, ‘[God] removed them.’ Similarly, “Behold, I shall force them away from their land.” @p128@p2<EN>The hidden [matters] are Adonoy’s our God’s.@p3 @rr°@bbIf you should ask, ‘What are we capable of doing? You punish the community for an individual’s thoughts, as it is said, “Perhaps there is, among you, etc.,” and after, “They will see the plagues of that land.” Isn’t a man ignorant of his fellow’s secrets’? I will not punish you for the inscrutable, which is Adonoy’s our God’s — He will punish that individual. However, what is exposed is for us and our posterity, to eradicate evil from our midst. If we fail to implement justice against them, then the community will be punished. There are dots over ours and our children’s to teach @rr°@bbthat, even with regard to what is exposed, the community was not punished until they had crossed the Yarden, when they obligated themselves with the oath at Mount Gerizim and Mount Eival, and became accountable for one another.<QC>
@p13@p2<EN>Adonoy your God will bring [lit. come] back your returnees.@p3 It should have written ‘Bring back’ your returnees. The Rabbis derive from here, that the Divine Presence, with all due reverence, resides with Yisroel in the suffering of their exile, so that, when they are redeemed, He ascribes redemption to Himself — He shall return with them. One may explain additionally: The day of the ingathering of exiles is as momentous and difficult as if He, Himself, would need to carry, literally in His grasp, every individual from his place, @rr°@bbas it is said, “You shall be plucked, one at a time, Bnei Yisroel.” And even with regard to the exiles of other nations we find this, “I shall bring [lit. come] back the returnees of Moav,” [“I shall bring [lit. come] back the returnees of Egypt”].<QC>
@p111@p2<EN>It is not abstruse to you.@p3 @rr°@bbIt is not concealed from you, as it is said, @hh<HEB>כִּי יִפָּלֵא@ee<ENG> — “If .<TIE>.<TIE>. is concealed from you,” @hh<HEB>וַתֵּרֶד פְלָאִים@ee<ENG> — [meaning] “she has plummeted into concealment,” concealed, wrapped in a cover.<QC>
@p112@p2<EN>It is not in heaven.@p3 @rr°@bbFor if it were in heaven, you would be required to ascend in quest of it so that you could study it.<QC>
@p114@p2<EN>For [the matter] is close to you.@p3 @rr°@bbThe Torah was presented to you in written and oral form. @p115@p2<EN>Life and goodness.@p3 One hinges on the other. @rr°@bbIf you act with goodness, then you have life, but if you act wickedly, then you have death. Scripture proceeds in explaining how.<QC>
@p116@p2<EN>For which I command you this day, to love.@p3 Here you have goodness. On it, hinges “so that you will live and flourish” — here you have life. @p117@p2<EN>But if your heart strays.@p3 Here you have wickedness. @p118@p2<EN>That you shall certainly perish.@p3 Here you have death. @p119@p2<EN>I invoke, as witnessess against you, this day, heaven and earth.@p3 As they endure eternally, @rr°@bbso that when evil befalls you, they will bear witness that I warned you concerning all of this. @rr°@bbAnother interpretation of “I invoke as witnesses against you this day, heaven etc.” The Holy One, may He be blessed, said to Yisroel, ‘Gaze at the heavens, which I created to serve you, have they, perhaps, altered their prescribed functions? Perhaps the sun failed to rise in orbit from the east to illuminate the whole world, as it is said, “The sun rises, and then the sun sets”? Gaze at the earth, which I created to serve you, has it, perhaps, altered its prescribed functions? Perhaps you planted it, and it failed to produce, or perhaps you planted wheat, and it produced barley? Now take these, which were created neither for gain, nor for loss — if meritorious, they reap no reward, and if sinful, they suffer no punishment — yet they did not alter their prescribed functions; then you, who, if meritorious, reap reward, and if sinful, suffer punishment, most certainly so.’ @d1Choose life.@d2 I instruct you to select the portion of life, like a man who tells his son, ‘Select, for yourself, an excellent portion in my estate’; then he guides him to the excellent portion, and says to him, ‘Choose this for yourself.’ Concerning this it is said, “Adonoy is my apportioned share, my drinking cup; You have upheld my lot” — You have placed my hand on the excellent lot, as if to say, ‘Take this for yourself.’<QC>
@p11@p2<EN>Moshe went, etc.@p3 @p12@p2<EN>I cannot any longer go forth and return.@p3 Perhaps his strength waned? The Torah therefore teaches, “His appearance was not dulled, and his freshness did not fade.” Then what is meant by “I cannot”? I am not permitted, for authority was removed from me and conferred on Yehoshua. @d1For Adonoy has said to me.@d2 @rr°@bbThis explains “I cannot any longer go forth and return” — for Adonoy said to me. @d1I am .<TIE>.<TIE>. today.@d2 Today my days and years are completed — today is the day I was born, and today is the day I will die. Another interpretation: To go forth and return with respect to words of Torah. @rr°@bbThis teaches that he was sealed off from the masoretic teachings and the wellsprings of wisdom.<QC>
@p16@p2<EN>He will not enfeeble you.@p3 @rr°@bbHe will not precipitate, in you, the feebleness of being abandoned by Him.<QC>
@p17@p2<EN>For you shall enter with this people.@p3 “For you shall enter ‘with’ this people.” Moshe told Yehoshua, @rr°@bb‘Let the elders of the generation join with you, let everything follow their opinion and counsel.’ But the Holy One, Blessed is He, told Yehoshua, “For you shall ‘take’ B’nei Yisroel into the land which I swore to them.” Take them, by coercion, with everything contingent on you. Get a stick, and beat their skulls — @rr°@bbone leader for the generation, and not two leaders for the generation.<QC>
@p19@p2<EN>Moshe wrote, etc., and gave it.@p3 @rr°@bbWhen it was completely finished, he gave it to his fellow tribesmen. @p110@p2<EN>After seven years have ended.@p3 During the first year of [the next] @ITSh’mittah,@it meaning the eighth year. Why, then, is it referred to as “the @ITSh’mittah@it year”? @rr°@bbBecause there are still seventh-year restrictions which apply — with the seventh-year harvest which overlaps after the seventh-year has departed. @p111@p2<EN>You shall read this Torah.@p3 The king recited, from the beginning of “These are the words,” as stated in tractate Sotah, on a wooden platform which was erected in the Temple courtyard. @p112@p2<EN>The men.@p3 To learn. @d1The women.@d2 To listen. @d1And the infants.@d2 Why did they come? @rr°@bbTo bring merit to those who brought them. @p114@p2<EN>And I shall exhort [lit. command] him.@p3 @rr°@bbI shall enthuse him. @p116@p2<EN>The stranger of the land.@p3 @rr°@bbThe nations of the land.<QC>
@p117@p2<EN>I shall conceal My face.@p3 @rr°@bbAs if I do not notice their suffering.<QC>
@p119@p2<EN>This song.@p3 “Hearken, O heaven” until “And reconcile his land, His people.” @p120@p2<EN>And infuriate Me.@p3 And enrage Me, as always with @hh<HEB>נִיאוּץ@ee<ENG>, which denotes rage. @p121@p2<EN>This song shall serve as testimony before them as witness.@p3 @rr°@bbThat I warned them, in it, of all that occurred to them. @d1For it shall never be forgotten from the lips of their progeny.@d2 @rr°@bbThis is a guarantee to Yisroel that the Torah will never be completely forgotten by their progeny.<QC>
@p123@p2<EN>He commanded Yehoshua, the son of Nun.@p3 @rr°@bbThis reverts to the text above in relation to the Divine Presence, as stated clearly, “to the land that I swore to them.”<QC>
@p126@p2<EN>Take.@p3 @rr°@bbLike “remember,” “keep,” “going.” @d1On the side of the ark of Adonoy’s .<TIE>.<TIE>. covenant.@d2 There is a difference of opinion here among the sages of Yisroel, in tractate Bava Basra. Some of them say, there was a shelf which extended outside the ark, and it was placed there. Others say, it was placed alongside the tablets, inside the ark. @p128@p2<EN>Assemble to me.@p3 @rr°@bbThey did not sound the trumpets, that day, to assemble the community, since it is said, “Make for yourself,” he did not empower Yehoshua to use them. @rr°@bbAnd even during his own lifetime they were concealed before the day he died [Another text: on the day he died], in fulfillment of that which is said, “there is no sovereignty on the day of death.” @d1And invoke as witnesses against them heaven and earth.@p3 But, one might contend, he already invoked them as witnesses above — “I invoke as witnesses against you, today, etc.” There, he spoke to the Israelites, but did not address heaven and earth. Now, however, he wanted to say, “Hearken, O heaven, etc.” @p129@p2<EN>After my death, that you will become depraved.@p3 Yet, throughout all the days of Yehoshua, they were not depraved, as it is said, “The people worshipped Adonoy all the days of Yehoshua.” [We derive] from here that a man’s disciple is as precious to him as his own person, for, so long as Yehoshua was alive, it appeared, to Moshe, as if he was alive himself.<QC>
@f3@p11@p2<EN>Hearken, O heaven.@p3 @rr°@bbThat I admonish the Israelites, @rr°@bbso that you may serve as witnesses to the matter. For so I informed them — that you would be witnesses. @rr°@bbSimilarly, “let the earth hear.” Why did he designate to testify against them heaven and earth? @rr°@bbMoshe said, “I am only flesh and blood, and tomorrow I may die. In case the Israelites declare, ‘We never assumed responsibility for fulfilling the covenant,’ who will refute them”? He therefore designated, to testify against them, heaven and earth, witnesses who endure forever. Furthermore, so that, if they so merit, the witnesses may come and reward them — “The grapevine shall give forth its fruit, the earth give forth its produce, and the heavens give forth their dew.” And if they are blameworthy, the hand of the witnesses may afflict them first — “He shall curb heaven, so that there will be no rain, and the earth shall not give forth its produce.” And after — “You shall quickly perish,” through the Gentile nations. @p12@p2<EN>Let my instruction flow like rainfall.@p3 @rr°@bbThis is the witness you are to bear: That I declare before you that the Torah which I have given Yisroel is life to the world like the very rainfall, which is life to the world @rr°@bbwhen the heavens flow with dew and rainfall. @d1Let [my instruction] flow.@d2 The meaning is “shall flow” [flowing] Similarly, “shall flow with dew,” “shall flow with opulence.” @d1Drip like dew.@d2 @rr°@bbWith which all rejoice, while rainfall brings dismay to some, for example, wayfarers, or someone with a cistern filled with wine. @d1Like storm winds.@d2 @rr°@bbAs in “storm wind,” as Targum [Onkelos] renders, “like rain winds.” Just as the winds fortify vegetation and nurture it, so do the words of Torah nurture those who study them. @d1Like raindrops.@d2 Drops of rain. It seems to me that, because it is propelled like an arrow, it is entitled “@hh<HEB>רְבִיב@ee<ENG>,” as it is said, “one who shoots the bow.” @d1Verdure.@d2 @ITErbediz,@it @rr°@bbthe envelopment of the earth when covered with vegetation. @d1Grass.@d2 A single blade is entitled “grass,” and each species individually is entitled “grass.” @p13@p2<EN>When I pronounce Adonoy’s name.@p3 @rr°@bbNow “@hh<HEB>כִּי@ee<ENG>“ is used to denote “when,” as in “When you arrive in the land.” When I make a pronouncement and mention Adonoy’s name, you must attribute magnificence to our God and bless His name. From here we derive @rr°@bbthat one responds “May the Name of His glorious kingdom be blessed” after a blessing in the Beis Hamikdosh.<QC>
@p14@p2<EN>The Almighty’s [lit.

@d1It is His children’s defect.@d2 @rr°@bbHis erstwhile children. Their destructiveness is a defect in them. @d1It is His children’s defect.@d2 @rr°@bbThe defect was His children’s, not His defect. @d1A warped generation.@d2 Crooked, perverted, as in “everything correct, they warp.” In the Mishnaic usage, “A rodent whose teeth are crooked and warped.” @d1Twisted.@d2 @ITEntortiliez,@it like a cord which one braids @rr°@bband winds around a pendant. @hh<HEB>פְּתַלְתֹּל@ee<ENG> is one of the dualized words, like @hh<HEB>יְרַקְּרַק@ee<ENG>, “deep green,” @hh<HEB>אֲדַמְדָּם@ee<ENG>, “deep red,” @hh<HEB>סְחַרְחַר@ee<ENG>, “surrounded,” @hh<HEB>סְגַלְגַּל@ee<ENG>, “circular.” @p16@p2<EN>Is it with Adonoy that you deal this way?@p3 This denotes astonishment. @rr°@bbIs it before Him that you cause displeasure, when it is in His power to punish you, and when He has granted you every benefit? @d1Base people.@d2 Who have forgotten what was done for them. @d1Lacking wisdom.@d2 The foresight to understand that He has the power to grant benefits and to destroy. @d1Is He not your Father, who made you His?@d2 @rr°@bbAs He took possession of you, @rr°@bbas He settled you in a nest — in a nest of rock mass, in a fortified land. He enhanced you with every kind of benefit. @d1He made you.@d2 @rr°@bbA nation among nations. @d1And gave you a base.@d2 Afterward, @rr°@bbwith every kind of basis and foundation. @rr°@bbSome of you are @ITkohanim,@it some prophets, some kings — a city which supports everything.<QC>
@p17@p2<EN>Remember world history.@p3 How He treated those before you who angered Him. @d1Study the generational epochs.@d2 Enosh’s generation, when He inundated them with the waters of Okianus, and the generation of the Deluge, when He flooded them. @rr°@bbAnother interpretation: You have not taken heed of the past. Comprehend the era of every generation, to recognize for the future that He has the power to bestow benefits upon you, and to grant to you the era of Moshiach, and the World to Come. @d1Ask your father.@d2 This refers to the prophets, entitled “fathers,” as it is said concerning Eliyahu, “My father, my father, carriage of Yisroel.” @d1Your elders.@d2 @rr°@bbThis refers to the sages. @d1And they will tell you.@d2 Ancient history.<QC>
@p18@p2<EN>When the Exalted One bequeathed nations.@p3 When the Holy One, Blessed is He, bequeathed, to those who aroused His fury, @rr°@bbtheir ancestral portions, He inundated and swamped them. @d1When He set apart the sons of man.@d2 When he scattered the dispersed generation, He could have annihilated them. He did not do so, but, rather, “He established national boundaries” — He sustained them, did not destroy them. @d1According to the number of Bnei Yisroel.@d2 Because of the number of Bnei Yisroel @rr°@bbwho were destined to issue from Shem’s posterity. Also, @rr°@bbaccording to the number of the seventy souls of Bnei Yisroel who descended into Egypt, He established national boundaries — seventy tongues.<QC>
@p19@p2<EN>Because [of] Adonoy’s portion, His people.@p3 Why all this? @rr°@bbBecause His portion was hidden among them, and was destined to emerge. Who are His portion? His people. Who are his people<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.? @d1Yaakov the cable of His heritage.@d2 @rr°@bbHe was the third patriarch, and was invested with a triple merit — the merit of his grandfather, the merit of his father, and his own merit. So there were three, like the cable, which consists of three strands. @rr°@bbHe and his sons were His [God’s] heritage, but not Yishmael, the son of Avrohom, and not Eisav, Yitzchak’s son.<QC>
@p110@p2<EN>He found them in a wilderness country.@p3 @rr°@bbHe found them faithful to Hashem in wilderness country, as they obligated themselves to His Torah, His sovereignty, and His yoke of bondage, which Yishmael and Eisav did not do, as it is said, “He radiated from Se’ir to them, appeared from Mount Paran.” @d1In arid, shrieking desolation.@d2 An arid, desolate land, an area with the shrieking of the @ITTaninim@it and the @ITBnos Ya’anah.@it There, too, they adhered to the faith, and did not say to Moshe, ‘How can we go into wildernesses, arid, desolate areas’? as it is said, “.<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>when you followed Me into the wilderness.” @d1He encircled them.@d2 There He encircled and enveloped them with clouds, and encircled them with banners on four sides, and encircled them with the bottom of the mountain, @rr°@bbwhich He arched over them like a barrel. @d1He granted them understanding.@d2 There, with Torah and wisdom. @d1He sheltered them.@d2 From serpents, venomous reptiles, scorpions, and from the Gentile nations. @d1Like the pupil of His eye.@d2 @rr°@bbThis refers to the dark area of the eye, from which light emanates. However, Onkelos renders, “He sustained them,” He provided for all their needs in the wilderness, as in, “and provide for them,” “the mountain does not sufficiently provide for us.” @d1He encircled them.@d2 @rr°@bbHe encamped them around His Presence — the Tent of Meeting at the center, and the four banners in four directions. @p111@p2<EN>Like an eagle who rouses his nest.@p3 @rr°@bbHe directed them with compassion and sympathy, like the eagle who is compassionate with his children. He does not enter his nest suddenly, until he causes a commotion and disturbance over his children with his wings, @rr°@bbbetween one tree and another, between one branch and the next, so that his children are roused, and are capable of receiving him. @d1Who rouses his nest.@d2 He arouses his children. @d1Fluttering over his young.@d2 He does not press himself on them, but hovers, touching yet not touching. So, too, the Holy One, Blessed is He — @rr°@bb”Shaddai — we did not find Him at full power.” When He came to give the Torah, He did not reveal Himself to them from one direction, but, rather, from four directions, @rr°@bbas it is stated, “Adonoy came from Sinai, radiated from Se’ir to them, appeared from Mount Paran, arriving with some of His sacred myriads.” “God came from Teiman” — this is the fourth direction. @d1He extends his wings, grasps them.@d2 When he comes to transport them from place to place, he does not grasp them with his talons like other birds. For the other birds fear the eagle, who soars high and flies above them — he therefore carries them in his talons because of the eagle. The eagle, however, fears nothing but the arrow, and, therefore, carries them on his wings, saying, ‘Better let the arrow enter me, and not enter my children.’ So, too, with the Holy One, Blessed is He, “I carried you on wings of eagles.” When the Egyptians pursued them and overtook them at the sea, they propelled arrows and projectiles at them. Immediately, “The angel of God moved, etc., and came between the Egyptian camp, etc.” @p112@p2<EN>Adonoy conducted them alone.@p3 @rr°@bbHe conducted them alone, in security, in the wilderness. @d1Without [opposition by] alien gods.@d2 @rr°@bbThere was no capability, among any of the gods of the Gentiles, of displaying their power by waging war with them. @rr°@bbThe Rabbis expound this as referring to the future, and Onkelos translates it similarly. @rr°@bbNow I say that these are words of reproach, calling on the testimony of heaven and earth, so that this song might serve as a warning to them, for they would ultimately betray the faith, and remember neither the early favors which He performed for them, nor the future ones which He would eventually perform for them. @rr°@bbTherefore, the matter must be reconciled both here and there. The entire subject revolves around “Remember world history, study the generational epochs” — this is what He did for them, and this is what He will eventually do. All this they should have remembered. @p113@p2<EN>He shall transport them@p3 [lit. cause them to ride] @d1over the summit of the earth.@d2 @rr°@bbThe entire passage should be understood as Targum [Onkelos] translates. @d1He shall transport them, etc.@d2 So called because Eretz Yisroel is the highest of all lands. @d1Where they will consume the produce of the fields.@d2 @rr°@bbThis refers to the fruits of Eretz Yisroel, which are quicker to develop and ripen than any fruit of the lands. @d1He shall nurture them with honey of bedrock.@d2 @rr°@bbThere was was an incident when @rr°@bbsomeone said to his son in Sichoni, @rr°@bb‘Bring me dried fig preserves from the barrel.’ He went, and found honey floating at the top.

Similarly, it says, “He formed a lip of his innards.” @d1[You] are covered.@d2 @rr°@bbThere is a “light” grammatical usage of the term “@hh<HEB>כִּסוּי@ee<ENG>,” as in, “He who covers an insult is clever.” If @hh<HEB>כִּשִּׂיתָ@ee<ENG> had been written with a punctuation dot, @rr°@bbit would have meant “You covered others,” as in “For he covered his face.” @d1He insulted the Rock of his salvation.@d2 He affronted and insulted Him, as it is said, “Their backsides towards the Sanctuary of Adonoy, etc.” Nothing is more contemptuous than this.<QC>
@p116@p2<EN>They incited His vengeance.@p3 @rr°@bbThey inflamed His fury and vengeance. @d1With loathsomeness.@d2 With loathsome behavior. For example, homosexuality and sorcery, which are depicted as “loathsome.” @p117@p2<EN>Ineffectual.@p3 As Targum [Onkelos] renders, @rr°@bb”Who fulfill no need.” @rr°@bbIf they had fulfilled some need, @rr°@bbthe vengeance would not have been as doubly harsh as now. @d1Novelties, lately arrived.@d2 Even the Gentiles were unaccustomed to them. A Gentile who saw them would say, ‘This is a Jewish idol.’ @d1Your forefathers were not awed by them.@d2 @rr°@bbThey did not fear them, their hair did not stiffen before them — a man’s hair customarily stiffens from dread. This is the way it is expounded by Sifrei. @rr°@bbIn addition, one may explain the word @hh<HEB>שְׂעָרוּם@ee<ENG> as having the same meaning as “Demons cavort there,” @hh<HEB>שְׂעִירִים@ee<ENG> referring to demons. Your forefathers did not regard those demons. @p118@p2<EN>You disregarded.@p3 You forgot. The Rabbis expound: When He intends to treat you benevolently, you behave heinously before him, @rr°@bbthus weakening His capacity for benevolence towards you.<QC>
@d1The Almighty Who delivered you.@d2 Who delivered you from the womb, having the same meaning as “Who causes trembling in the mighty,” “Trembling like a woman at birthing.” @p120@p2<EN>What their end will be.@p3 @rr°@bbWhat will occur to them at their end. @d1For they are an upsetting generation.@d2 @rr°@bbThey upset My good will and turn it to wrath.<QC>
@d1Devoid of breeding.@d2 @rr°@bbMy training is not noticeable in them, for I instructed them in the proper path, but they strayed from it. @d1Breeding.@d2 The meaning is the same as “He nurtured,” @ITnorture,@it in Old French. @rr°@bbAnother interpretation: @hh<HEB>אֵמֻן@ee<ENG> denotes faithfulness, as Targum [Onkelos] translates. They declared at Sinai, “We shall do, and we shall listen,” and in a fleeting instant reneged on their pledge, and made the [golden] calf. @p121@p2<EN>Incited Me to vengeance.@p3 They inflamed My wrath. @d1With a non-god.@d2 With something which is not a God. @d1With a non-people.@d2 With a nation with no reputation, as it is said, “Lo, the land of Kasdim — this people is a non-entity.” And concerning Eisav it says, “you are extremely despicable.” @d1I shall anger them with a faithless nation.@d2 This refers to atheists. Similarly, it says, “The faithless says in his heart, ‘there is no God.”’<QC>
@p122@p2<EN>Shall blaze.@p3 Shall burn. @d1That will burn.@d2 You @rr°@bbdown to the foundation. @d1It shall consume the land and its produce.@d2 Your land and its produce. @d1And enflame.@d2 @rr°@bbJerusalem, which is founded on mountains, as it is said, “Jerusalem is surrounded by mountains.” @p123@p2<EN>I shall amass iniquity against them.@p3 I shall link evil with evil. This means the same as “Join year to year,” “To add the sated,” “Add your burnt-offerings to your peace-offerings.” @rr°@bbAnother interpretation of @hh<HEB>אַסְפֶּה@ee<ENG>, “I shall consume”, as in “Lest you be consumed.” @d1I shall deplete my arrows against them.@d2 I shall completely expend all my arrows against them. This curse, in serving as a punishment, is actually a blessing — my arrows shall be depleted, but they shall not be depleted.<QC>
@p124@p2<EN>Bloated with hunger.@p3 Onkelos renders “Bloated with hunger,” but I have no evidence supportive of this. In the name of R’ Moshe Hadarshan of Tolouse I have heard, “Hairy with hunger.” A lean man sprouts hair on his flesh.<QC>
@d1Bloated@d2 In Aramaic, “hair” is @hh<HEB>מִזַּיָּא@ee<ENG>. @rr°@bb”He would tousle his hair.” @d1Embattled with demons.@d2 Demons battled them, as it is said, “But the sons of demons soar aloft,” referring to demons. @d1Slashed by Meriri.@d2 Slashed by a demon named Meriri. @d1Slashed.@d2 Cut down, as, “I shall cut you down into the grave.” @d1Teeth of animals.@d2 @rr°@bbThere was an incident where sheep bites were fatal. @d1The venom of dust-crawlers.@d2 The venom of snakes which crawl on their bellies in the dust, like water rolling on the ground. @hh<HEB>זְחִילָה@ee<ENG> denotes the movement of water on the ground, and, as well, the movement of anything which progresses by sliding along the ground. @p125@p2<EN>From without, the sword shall decimate.@d2 Outside the city, the sword of armed legions shall decimate them. @d1From within the chambers, terror.@d2 If he should flee and escape the sword, @rr°@bbthe chambers of his heart pound with terror, continuing until he expires. @rr°@bbAnother interpretation of “From within the chambers, terror”: Indoors will be terror of the plague, as it is said, “For death has entered through our windows.” This is how Onkelos translates it. Another interpretation: “Because of the outdoors, the sword shall decimate” — because of their behavior out of doors, as it is said, “According to the number of outdoor areas in Jerusalem, you have set up altars to debasement.” “Because of the chambers, terror” — because of their behavior in the innermost chambers, as it is said, “What the elders of the house of Yisroel do in the dark, each one in his paneled chamber.” @p126@p2<EN>I thought [lit. said], ‘I shall abandon them.’@p3 I said privately, I shall abandon them. We may interpret @hh<HEB>אַפְאֵיהֶם@ee<ENG> as ‘I shall render them @ITPei’ah,@it discarding them into abandonment.’ We find an example of this in Ezra, “You delivered, to them, kingdoms and peoples, whom You dispersed as @ITPei’ah@it” — into abandonment. This is Menachem’s understanding. Now @rr°@bbsome interpret this according to Targum’s [Onkelos] translation, “I shall visit my fury upon them”; but this is untenable, for if so, it should have written @hh<HEB>אֲאַפְאֵיהֶם@ee<ENG>, one [@ITaleph@it] as a prefix, and one from the root, as in “I girded you,” “I fortified you by my word.” @rr°@bbAlso, the middle @ITaleph@it is totally inappropriate. @rr°@bbOnkelos’s translation follows the text of the @ITBeraysa@it quoted by Sifrei, which divides this word into three words — I thought ‘in fury where are they.’ I thought, in my fury, that I would render them non-entities, so that those who look for them would say, concerning them, ‘Where are they’? @p127-29@p2<EN>Were it not for the enemy’s amassed rage.@p3 @rr°@bbWere it not that the enemy’s rage is amassed against them for destruction, @rr°@bband if he were to overcome them and destroy them, he would attribute greatness to himself and his gods, but would not attribute greatness to Me. This is why it is said<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. @d1Lest their oppressors estrange.@d2 They estrange the matter by attributing their power to a stranger who has no greatness. @d1Lest they say, ‘Our armed might has prevailed,’ etc. For@d2 that @d1Nation squanders counsel, they lack intelligence.@d2 @rr°@bbFor if they were wise, @d1They would grasp this.@p3 How could [one] pursue, etc. @d1They would contemplate their ending.@d2 They would apply themselves to contemplating @rr°@bbthe ending punishment of Yisroel.<QC>
@p130@p2<EN>How can one pursue.@p3 @rr°@bbOne of us [pursue] a thousand of Yisroel. @d1Unless their Almighty [lit. rock] has dealt them away, and Adonoy has delivered them?@d2 Dealt them away and delivered them into our hands. @ITDelivrer@it in Old French. @p131@p2<EN>For their mighty one is not like our Almighty.@p3 All this the enemies should have understood — that God delivered them, and the victory is neither theirs nor their gods’, for heretofore their gods were powerless against our Almighty, for their rock is not like our Rock. @rr°@bb@hh<HEB>צוּר@ee<ENG> in Scripture always denotes a rock. @d1Yet our enemies sit in judgement.@d2 Yet now our enemies judge us, since our Almighty has dealt us away to them. @p132@p2<EN>For their grapevine is of the grapevine of Sedom.@p3 This relates to the the above text: I thought privately I shall abandon them and abolish their memory, because their behavior is the behavior of Sedom and Amorah. @d1Fields.@d2 Arable fields, as in “The fields have produced no food,” “In the fields of Kidron.” @d1Grapes of bitter herbs.@d2 Clusters galling to them. @d1Clusters galling to them.@d2 @rr°@bbGalling beverages are appropriate for them — their punishment suits their behavior. Onkelos translates similarly, “The retribution for their behavior corresponds with their bitterness.” @p133@p2<EN>Like caustic serpents’ venom is their wine.@p3 As Targum [Onkelos] renders, “Behold, like caustic serpents’ venom is the cup of their punishment.” Behold, like caustic snake venom is the drinking cup of their punishment. @d1The gall of adders.@d2 @rr°@bbTheir cup, merciless to the bite victim. @rr°@bbA merciless enemy shall come and punish them. @p134@p2<EN>Is this not sequestered with Me?@p3 As Targum [Onkelos] translates. They think I have forgotten their actions — they are all hidden away and guarded before Me. @d1Is this not.@d2 @rr°@bbThe fruit of their grapevine, and the produce of their fields are sequestered with Me. @p135@p2<EN>Vengeance is with Me, and shall administer retribution.@p3 @rr°@bbWith Me, ready and available, is<FJ> @rr°@bbthe punishment by vengeance, and it shall administer retribution to them in accordance with their behavior. The vengeance shall administer retribution to them. @rr°@bbSome interpret @hh<HEB>וְשִׁלֵּם@ee<ENG> as a noun, like @hh<HEB>וְשִׁלּוּם@ee<ENG>, “and retribution.” @rr°@bbThis is similar to “The word is not theirs,” like @hh<HEB>וְהַדִּבּוּר@ee<ENG>, “and the word.” When will I administer retribution to them? @d1At the time that they shall stumble.@d2 @rr°@bbAt the termination of the merit of their forefathers, upon which they lean for support. @d1For the day of their calamity is close by.@d2 @rr°@bbAs soon as I desire to inflict upon them the day of their calamity, it is close by and available to Me, to be inflicted through many emissaries. @d1Destiny speeds towards them.@d2 Quickly, destiny will be upon them. @d1Speeds.@d2 Like “Let Him hurry, quicken.” Until this point, Moshe established testimony, for them, with words of reproach, wherein this song would serve witness. When they will be afflicted with punishment, they will know that I informed them beforehand. From this point onward, he established testimony with words of solace, which will transpire when the punishment ends, in accordance with all that was said above, “It will come to pass that, when all of these things will happen to you, etc., the blessing and the curse, etc., Adonoy, your God, will return your exiles, etc.” @p136@p2<EN>When Adonoy administers justice against His people.@p3 @rr°@bbWhen He punishes them with the afflictions described above, as in “For through them He shall administer justice to the nations,” (Shall afflict the nations). @hh<HEB>כִּי@ee<ENG> here is not understood as “because,” providing the reason for the preceding statement. Rather, it is introductory, as in, “When you arrive in the land.” ‘When these punishments will be visited upon them, then @rr°@bbthe Holy One, Blessed is He, will reconsider, concerning His servants, and revert to have compassion for them.’ @d1Will reconsider.@d2 This denotes a change of heart, whether benevolently or destructively. @d1When He sees the power [lit. hand] surging.@d2 @rr°@bbWhen He sees that the power of the enemy is surging to the utmost against them, and that there is no one, among them, structured or fortified. @d1Structured.@d2 Saved by an organizer and ruler who structures them. @d1Fortified.@d2 By someone who furnishes support. The organizer is the ruler who structures the people, so that they do not proceed haphazardly when advancing to battle the enemy. In Old French, @ITmeintenant.@it @d1Structured.@d2 This refers to someone saved by the ruler’s structure. @d1Fortified.@d2 Strengthened, as in “They fortified Jerusalem until the wall,” “How is it that the adored city was not fortified.” @ITEnforcied.@it @p137@p2<EN>He shall say.@p3 The Holy One, Blessed is He, concerning them, ‘Where is their god whom they worshipped’? @d1The rock on which they relied for shelter.@d2 The rock mass with which they shielded themselves from the sun and the cold; as if to say, they placed their faith in it, to protect them from harm. @p138@p2<EN>They [ate] the fat of their sacrifices.@p3 Those gods would eat [the offerings] which they brought before them, and drink their libation wine. @d1Let them serve as your shield.@d2 That rock — let it serve as your shelter and shield. @p139@p2<EN>Now observe!@p3 Learn from the punishment which I visited upon you, when no one could save you, and from the deliverance which I shall grant you, when no one will thwart Me. @d1For it is I!

I hold judgment in My grasp, to embrace it and exact vengeance. @d1I shall wreak vengeance, etc.@d2 In the Aggadic commentary, the Rabbis derive from the language of the text, which states “And I hold judgement in My grasp”: Unlike the practice of mortals is the practice of the Holy One, Blessed is He. In the practice of mortals, one who lets fly an arrow can no longer retrieve it; But the Holy One, Blessed is He, lets fly His arrows with the power to retrieve them, as if He retained them in His grasp, for the gleam represents His arrow, as it is said here, “My saber to a gleam, and I hold judgement in My grasp.” @rr°@bb”Judgment” here denotes retribution, in Old French, @ITjustice.@it @p142@p2<EN>I shall make my arrows drunk with blood@p3 of @rr°@bbthe enemy.<QC>
@d1My saber shall consume flesh@d2 their flesh. @d1For the blood of the slaughtered and the captives.@d2 @rr°@bbThis will befall them because of their guilt over the blood of slaughtered Israelites, and the captives which they took from them. @d1For the original savagery of the enemy.@d2 @rr°@bbFor the iniquity of the original devastation by the enemy. For, when the Holy One, Blessed is He, punishes the nations, He invokes against them their sins, and the sins of their forefathers, from the original devastation which they perpetrated against Yisroel.<QC>
@p143@p2<EN>Let the nations extol His people.@p3 At that time, the nations will praise Yisroel. ‘Look at how praiseworthy this nation is. They remained wedded to the Holy One, Blessed is He, through all the privation which overtook them. They did not forsake Him, knowing His goodness and virtue.’ @d1For He shall avenge the blood of His servants.@d2 The shedding of their blood, as the words indicate. @d1And wreak vengeance on His enemies.@d2 @rr°@bbFor theft and plunder, as it is said, “Egypt shall be laid waste, and Edom shall become a desert wasteland, for plundering the sons of Yehudah.” And it says, “For plundering your brother Yaakov, etc.’ @d1And reconcile His land, His people.@d2 @rr°@bbHe will pacify His land and His people for all the suffering which overtook them, and which the enemy perpetrated against them. @d1And reconcile.@d2 This denotes conciliation and pacification, like, “I may pacify his anger,” “I may calm his rage.” @d1And reconcile His land.@d2 What is His land? @d1His people.@d2 When His people are consoled, His land is consoled. Similarly, it says, “Adonoy, You pacified Your land.” How did You pacify Your land? “You brought back Yaakov’s exiles.” @rr°@bbWith a different viewpoint this is expounded in Sifrei, R’ Yehudah and R’ Nechemiah disagreeing over it. R’ Yehudah expounds it entirely in reference to Yisroel, while R’ Nechemiah expounds it entirely in reference to the nations. R’ Yehudah expounds it entirely in reference to Yisroel: “I thought, ‘I shall abandon them”’ [v. 26] as I interpreted, until, “Adonoy did not effect all this” [v. 27]. “For they are a nation which squanders counsel”[v. 28] — they squandered my Torah, which provided them with astute counsel. “They lack the intelligence” [v. 29] to grasp — how one, from the nations, can pursue a thousand of them. “Unless their Almighty dealt them away” [v. 30]. “For their mighty one is not like our Almighty” [v. 31] — everything as I have explained, until the end. But R’ Nechemiah expounds it in reference to the nations. “For those nations squander counsel” [v. 28] as I explained previously, until, “Yet our enemies sit in judgement” [V. 31].<QC>
@p132@p2<EN>For their grapevine is of the grapevine of Sedom.@p3 The nations’ grapevine. @d1And from the fields of Amorah, etc.@d2 But they pay no heed, and do not ascribe the greatness to Me. @d1Their grapes are grapes of bitter herbs.@d2 This follows what is said, “Were it not for the enemy’s amassed rage” [v. 27] — against Yisroel, to poison and embitter them. Therefore, let them have bitter clusters, to gorge them for their action against my children. @p133@p2<EN>Their wine is like caustic serpents’ venom.@p3 Ready for them to drink because of their actions against them. @p134@p2<EN>Sequestered with me.@p3 That cup of which it is said, “For there is a cup in the hand of Adonoy, etc.” @p135@p2<EN>At the time that they shall stumble.@p3 As it is said, “The foot shall trample it.” @p136@p2<EN>For Adonoy shall administer justice for His people.@p3 @rr°@bbIn this usage, @hh<HEB>כִּי@ee<ENG> is @rr°@bbunderstood as “for.” And “administer justice” does not denote imposing suffering, but is understood, rather, as “For He shall represent them in their struggle from the clutches of those who dispossess them, when He sees the power surging, etc.” @p137@p2<EN>He shall say, ‘Where is their God’?@p3 The enemy shall say, ‘Where is the God of Yisroel’? as the villain Titus said when he slashed the @ITParoches@it (curtain), as it is said, “When my enemy sees, mortification will blanket her for saying to me, ‘Where is Adonoy your God”’?<QC>
@p139@p2<EN>Now observe! For it is I, etc.@p3 @rr°@bbThe Holy One, may He be blessed, will then unveil His salvation, and say, ‘Now observe! For it is I! I am the One! @rr°@bbIt is from Me that your ruin emanated, @rr°@bband from Me that your benefaction will come.’ @d1And no one can rescue from My grasp.@d2 Can rescue you from the ruin which I shall visit upon you. @p140@p2<EN>For I shall lift My hand heavenward.@p3 @rr°@bbLike “I have raised.” I always rest my Presence in heaven, as rendered by Targum [Onkelos]. Even with a weakling on high against the powerful below, the awesomeness of the higher one overcomes the lower; certainly, when the powerful is on high, and the weakling is below. @d1My hand.@d2 The place of My Presence, like “Everyone in his place.” I had the power to punish them, but I said, ‘I shall live forever.’ I do not rush to punish, as I have ample time for the matter, for I shall live forever. During the last generations I can punish them, and it is within My power to punish the living and the dead. A mortal king, who must die, hurries to avenge and punish while he lives — for he or his enemy may die, and he may thus never realize his vengeance against him. I, however, shall live forever. If they die without my punishing them during their lifetime, I shall punish them after death.<QC>
@p141@p2<EN>When I whet My saber to a gleam.@p3 In many places @hh<HEB>אִם@ee<ENG> is not conditional — ‘When I whet My saber to a gleam, and hold judgement in My grasp,’ everything as I explained above. @p144@p2<EN>He and Hoshe’a, the son of Nun.@p3 @rr°@bbIt was a Shabbos of shared quality, when leadership was removed from one and conferred upon the other. Moshe arranged for a public crier for Yehoshua, to enable him to expound during his lifetime, so that the Israelites would not say, ‘During your master’s lifetime you were unable to lift your head!’ And why is he entitled here “Hoshe’a”? @rr°@bbTo teach that he was not conceited, for, although leadership was conferred upon him, he was as unassuming as originally.<QC>
@p146@p2<EN>Focus your thoughts.@p3 A person is required to concentrate his sight, thought, and hearing on the word of Torah. Similarly, it says, “Son of man; view with your eyes, listen with your ears, and focus your mind.” It may be inferred from the following: Take architectural design, which is subject to visual inspection, and may be measured with the yardstick; yet a man must concentrate his sight, hearing, and thought to grasp it. Then to comprehend the word of Torah, @rr°@bbwhich is comparable to a mountain balanced on a hair, most certainly so.<QC>
@p147@p2<EN>For it is not a futile thing for you.@p3 It is not futile for you to weary yourselves with it, for enormous recompense is contingent on it — for it is your very lives. Another explanation: There is nothing in the Torah so empty @rr°@bbthat, if expounded, would not yield recompense. The proof is @rr°@bbfrom the following comment by the Rabbis: “Lotan’s sister was Timna.” “Timna was the concubine, etc.” Because she said, ‘I am unworthy of being his wife — would that I may become his concubine.’ Why to that extent? This informs us of Avrohom’s eminence, as potentates and kings longed to unite themselves with his descendants.<QC>
@p148@p2<EN>Adonoy spoke to Moshe at the very height of that day.@p3 @rr°@bbIn three places, it is said, “At the very height of that day.” It is said concerning Noach, “At the very height of that day, Noach entered, etc.” — when the light of day was in full view. Since his contemporaries said, ‘By so-and-so, if we sense him leaving, we won’t permit him to enter the ark, and furthermore, we will get sledgehammers and axes, and smash the ark’! The Holy One, Blessed is He, said, ‘I will bring him in at mid-day. Let anyone powerful enough to obstruct come and do so!’ — Concerning Egypt, it is said, “At the very height of that day, Adonoy delivered.” Since the Egyptians said, ‘By so-and so, if we sense them leaving, we won’t permit them to go. And furthermore, we will get swords and other weapons and kill them. The Holy One, Blessed is He, said, ‘I will deliver them at mid-day. Let anyone powerful enough to obstruct come and do so.’ Here too, concerning Moshe’s death, it is said, “At the very height of this day.” Since the Israelites said, ‘By so-and so, if we sense him leaving, we won’t let go of him. The man who took us out of Egypt, split the sea for us, brought down the manna for us, swept the quail over to us, brought up the well-spring for us, and gave us the Torah! We won’t let go of him!’ The Holy One, Blessed is He, said, ‘I will gather him up at mid-day, etc.’ @p150@p2<EN>Just as your brother Aharon died.@p3 @rr°@bbWith the very death you witnessed and longed for. For Moshe removed Aharon’s first garment, and attired Elazar in it; he did so with the second, and with the third, so that he [Aharon] witnessed his son inheriting his glory. Moshe said to him, ‘My brother Aharon, recline on the bed’ — he reclined. ‘Extend your arms’ — he extended them. ‘Extend your legs’ — he extended them. ‘Close your eyes’ — and he closed them. Close your mouth, He closed it, and passed on. Moshe said, ‘Fortunate is one who dies such a death.’ @p151@p2<EN>Because you were unfaithful to me.@p3 @rr°@bbYou were the cause of unfaithfulness to Me. [A different text: Because you rebelled against My word — you were the cause of rebellion against My word.] @d1That you did not sanctify Me.@d2 Because of you, I was not sanctified, for I commanded you, “Speak to the rock.” But they struck it, then needed to strike it twice. If they had spoken to it, and it had produced its water without having been struck, the Name of Heaven would have been sanctified. For the Israelites would have said, ‘If the rock, which is not subject to reward or punishment — if meritorious, it gains no reward, and if sinful, it suffers no punishment — and so carefully fulfills its Creator’s command, then most certainly we.’ @p152@p2<EN>For from afar.@p3 @rr°@bbAt a distance.<FJ> @d1You will see, etc.@d2 @rr°@bbFor if you will not see it now, you will never see it again in your lifetime. @d1But you will not come there.@d2 I know that it is precious to you. This is why I say to you, “Go up and see!”<QC>
@p11@p2<EN>This is the blessing .<TIE>.<TIE>. before his death.@p3 @rr°@bbClose to his death, for ‘If not now, when’? @p12@p2<EN>He said: Adonoy came from Sinai.@p3 @rr°@bbHe began with the praise of God, and afterward, he introduced the needs of the Israelites. And his opening praise @rr°@bbalso mentions the merit of the Israelites. All this by way of seeking favor, as if to say, ‘They are worthy of receiving blessings.’ @d1Came from Sinai.@d2 @rr°@bbHe went out to meet them when they came to station themselves at the foot of the mountain, like a bridegroom going forward to receive his bride, as it is said, “Toward God” — this teaches that He went forward towards them. @d1Radiated forth to them from Seir.@d2 As He had made an overture to the children of Eisav, to accept the Torah — but they refused. @d1[He] appeared.@d2 @rr°@bbTo them. @d1From Mount Paran.@d2 where He went to make an overture to the children of Yishmael to accept it — but they refused. @d1He came.@d2 @rr°@bbTo the Israelites. @d1With part of the sacred myriads.@d2 Accompanied by @rr°@bbpart of the myriads of sacred angels, but not all or most of them; unlike the manner of a mortal, who displays all the glory of his affluence and splendor on his wedding day. @d1The flaming Torah law.@d2 Which was inscribed before Him in the remote past @rr°@bbin black flame on white flame, he gave them in the tablets inscribed by His right hand. @rr°@bbAnother interpretation, @hh<HEB>אֵשׁדָּת@ee<ENG> — as rendered by Targum [Onkelos], ‘which was given to them from the fire.’ @p13@p2<EN>He also cherished the nations.@p3 Also, with surpassing love @rr°@bbHe cherished the tribes. Each of them was entitled a “people,” for only Binyamin was destined to be born when the Holy One, Blessed is He, said to Yaakov, “A nation and community of nations shall emanate from you.” @d1All of their sacred ones are in Your keeping.@d2 The souls of the saints secreted with Him, about which it is said, “The soul of my master shall be bound in the bond of life with Adonoy your God.” @d1For they were gathered in at Your feet.@d2 @rr°@bbThey were worthy of this, for they were gathered in under the foot of the mountain at Your feet at Sinai. @hh<HEB>תֻּכּוּ@ee<ENG> denotes the reflexive, they were gathered into your footrest. @d1And accepted the burden of Your word.@d2 They accepted upon themselves the yoke of Your Torah. @d1Your word.@d2 @rr°@bbThe “@hh<HEB>מֶ"ם@ee<ENG>“ here relates to the root, as in, “He heard the voice speaking to him,” “And I heard that which was spoken to me,” like @hh<HEB>מִתְדַּבֵּר@ee<ENG>, “that which was self-spoken to me.” @rr°@bbHere too, “Your self-spoken” — that which You had spoken so that I would hear and relate it to them. @ITtes pourparlers,@it speaking to oneself, in Old French. But Onkelos renders, “They journeyed by Your words,” with the @hh<HEB>מֶ"ם@ee<ENG> as a prefix, having the connotation of “by.” @rr°@bbAnother interpretation: “Even when the nations were cherished,” even during the time when the Gentile nations were cherished, when You displayed to the Gentiles, a beaming countenance, and delivered the Jews into their hands — @d1All of their sacred ones are in Your keeping.@d2 All of their saintly and virtuous ones clung to You, and did not distance themselves from You, and You sheltered them. @d1They were gathered in at Your feet.@d2 They ensconce themselves and gather themselves under Your shelter. @d1And accepted the burden of Your word.@d2 They accept Your decrees and commandments joyfully, and declare the following:<QC>
@p14@p2<EN>The Torah.@p3 Which Moshe commanded to us is the heritage of the congregation of Yaakov. We have embraced it, and shall not forsake it. @p15@p2<EN>There was.@p3 The Holy One, Blessed is He. @d1King in Yeshurun.@d2 @rr°@bbThe yoke of His sovereignty rests always upon them. @d1At the gathering.@d2 @rr°@bbAt every gathering. “Of the counting” — the counting of their gathering. @d1Of the counting.@d2 As in “When you take count.” @rr°@bbThese are worthy of my blessing. @rr°@bbAnother interpretation: “When they gathered.” When they gather together as a single unit, and there is harmony among them — then He is their king, but not when there is dissention among them. @p16@p2<EN>May Reuvein live.@p3 @rr°@bbIn this world. @d1Let him not die.@d2 @rr°@bbIn the World to Come, as the incident of Bilhah will not be reckoned against him. @d1May his constituency be counted.@d2 May they be counted in the census with the rest of his brothers. This is comparable to that which is said, “He laid with Bilhah. There were twelve sons of Yaakov” — he was not excluded from the count.<QC>
@p17@p2<EN>Now this for Yehudah.@p3 He placed Yehudah next to Reuvein, because both confessed to the iniquity of which they were guilty, as it is said, “That wise men acknowledged, etc., to them alone, etc., @rr°@bbno stranger passed between them.” In addition, the Rabbis explain that throughout the forty years that the Israelites were in the wilderness, Yehudah’s bones rolled about in his coffin, because of the banishment which he accepted upon himself, as it is said, “I will have sinned against my father for all time.” @rr°@bbMoshe said, ‘Who was responsible for Reuvein’s confession? Yehudah, etc.’ @d1Adonoy, hear the voice of Yehudah.@d2 The prayers of Dovid and Shlomo, Asa because of the Cushites, Yehoshafat because of the Ammonites, and Chizkiyahu because of Sancheiriv. @d1And bring him to his people.@d2 In peace, after warfare. @d1May his hands fight his battles.@d2 May they fight his battles and exact his vengeance. @d1May You provide assistance against his enemies.@d2 He prayed for Yehoshafat at the battle of Gilad heights — “Yehoshafat cried out, and Adonoy assisted him.” @rr°@bbAnother interpretation [of] “Adonoy, hear the voice of Yehudah” — here he alluded to a blessing for Shimon, amidst Yehudah’s blessings. Also, when Eretz Yisroel was apportioned, Shimon took [a portion] amidst Yehudah’s allotment, as it is said, “From the portion of the sons of Yehudah, the inheritance of the sons of Shimon.” (Why didn’t he devote a specific blessing to him? Because he was resentful towards him for his behavior at Shittim. This is recorded in Agadas Tehilim.) @p18@p2<EN>Regarding [lit. to] Levi he said.@p3 @rr°@bbRegarding Levi he said. @d1Your @BItumim@BO and @BIurim.@it@d2 He speaks directly to the Shechinah.<QC>
@d1Whom You tried with tests.@d2 They did not complain with the rest of those who voiced complaints. @d1You brought him strife, etc.@d2 @rr°@bbAs Targum [Onkelos] renders. Another interpretation. “You contended with him at the waters of Merivah.” @rr°@bbYou set upon him with a spurious charge. @rr°@bbIf Moshe exclaimed, “Now listen, rebels”!, what did Aharon and Miriam do? @p19@p2<EN>Who said of his father and mother, ‘I did not see them.’@p3 When they sinned with the golden calf, and I proclaimed, “Whoever is for Adonoy, join me”! all the sons of Levi gathered around me. I commanded them to execute a maternal grandfather, if he was an Israelite, or a maternal half-brother, or a son of a daughter, and they did so. But this cannot be interpreted literally as a father, or paternal brother, likewise not literally as a son, since they were Levites, and of the tribe of Levi. no one sinned, as it is said, “@ITAll@it the sons of Levi.” @d1For they observed your command.@d2 @rr°@bb”You must not have other Gods.” @d1And kept Your covenant.@d2 The covenant of circumcision. @rr°@bbFor, of those born in the wilderness, the Israelites did not circumcise their children, but they [the Levites] were circumcised, and they circumcised their children. [An alternate Rashi text: Those born in the wilderness, as the Israelites did not circumcise their children, but they were circumcised.] @p110@p2<EN>They shall teach your law.@p3 @rr°@bbThey are worthy of this. @d1And totally consumed offerings.@d2 @rr°@bbThe @ITolah.@it @p111@p2<EN>Shatter his adversaries at the loins.@p3 Shatter his adversaries with a blow at the loins, as it is written, “Cause their loins to stumble always.” It was concerning those who challenged the priesthood that he said this. Another interpretation:<FJ> @rr°@bbHe foresaw that Chashmonai and his sons were destined to wage war with the Yevanim, so he prayed for them, as they were so few — the twelve sons of Chashmonai and Elazar against many myriads. This is why it is said, “Adonoy, bless his wealth and accept his handiwork.” @d1And his enemies, so that they may not arise.@d2 @rr°@bbShatter his adversaries and enemies, so that they may not gain ascendancy. @p112@p2<EN>Regarding Binyomin he said.@p3 @rr°@bbBecause Levi’s blessing was concerned with the sacrificial services, and that of Binyomin with the construction of the Beis Hamikdosh in his territory, he placed them next to one another. And he placed Yoseif after him [Binyomin] since, he, too, had the Tabernacle at Shiloh constructed in his territory, as it is said, “He was repulsed by the tent of Yoseif, etc.” @rr°@bbAnd because the Eternal Sanctuary is more cherished than Shiloh, he therefore gave preference to Binyomin over Yoseif.<QC>
@d1He hovers protectively over him.@d2 He covers and shields him. @d1Throughout the day.@d2 @rr°@bbEternally — once Jerusalem was chosen, the Divine Presence did not rest anywhere else. @d1And He resides between his shoulders.@d2 @rr°@bbAt the pinnacle of his territory, the Beis Hamikdosh was constructed, except that it was twenty-three @ITamohs@it below Eitam spring. It was there that David had intended to construct it, as stated in Shechitas Kodashim, [but] they remarked, ‘Let us descend a little, for it is written, “He resides between his shoulders” — nothing is pleasing, about the ox, more than his shoulders.’<QC>
@p113@p2<EN>Blessed by Adonoy is his land.@p3 @rr°@bbFor none of the tribal territories was as replete with bounty of every kind as Yoseif’s territory. @d1With the delight.@d2 This denotes delight and sweetness. @d1And the deep waters.@d2 @rr°@bbAs the waters of the deep rise, and irrigate it from below. @rr°@bbYou find that, with all the tribes, Moshe’s blessing resembled Yaakov’s blessing.<QC>
@p114@p2<EN>With the delight of the sun’s harvest.@p3 As his territory was exposed to sunlight, which sweetened the fruit. @d1Moon’s ripening.@d2 Some fruit are ripened by the moon. They are: cucumbers and melons. @rr°@bbAnother interpretation. “The monthly yield,” which the earth sheds and generates each month. @p115@p2<EN>With the first fruits of the early mountains. @p3 @rr°@bbBlessed, also, with the first-<FJ> ripening fruits, as its mountains are early in producing ripened fruit. @rr°@bbAnother interpretation: This teaches that their creation preceded that of the other mountains. @d1The perennial hills.@d2 @rr°@bbHills which are always productive, never failing for lack of rain. @p116@p2<EN>And the favor of the One who resides in the thornbush.@p3 [@hh<HEB>שׁוֹכְנִי@ee<ENG> is] Like @hh<HEB>שׁוֹכֵן@ee<ENG>, [the One who resides] in the thornbush. May his territory be blessed by the favor and gratification of the Holy One, Blessed is He, who first revealed Himself to me at the thornbush. @d1Favor.@d2 Gratification and conciliation. “@hh<HEB>רָצוֹן@ee<ENG>“ is similarly interpreted throughout Scripture. @d1Let this be visited.@d2 @rr°@bbThis blessing, upon Yoseif’s head. @d1The one set apart from his brothers.@d2 As he was set apart from his brothers when he was sold. @p117@p2<EN>His firstborn ox.@p3 @rr°@bb@hh<HEB>בְּכוֹר@ee<ENG> sometimes denotes grandeur and regency, as it is said, “I shall also give him grandeur.” Similarly, “My magnificent son, Yisroel.” @d1Firstborn.@d2 The king descended from him. @d1His ox.@d2 This refers to Yehoshua, @rr°@bbwho was as supremely powerful as the ox in vanquishing many kings. @d1Glory to him.@d2 Given to him, as it is said, “Give him some of your splendor.” @d1And @BIre’em’s@BO horns are his horns.@d2 @rr°@bbThe ox is supremely powerful, but his horns are unattractive, whereas the @ITre’em’s@it horns are beautiful, but his strength not very great. He invested Yehoshua with the strength of the ox, and the beauty of the horns of the @ITre’em.@it @d1To the ends of the earth.@d2 Thirty-one kings. @rr°@bbIs it possible that all of them were natives of Eretz Yisroel? But, rather, there was hardly a monarch or potentate who didn’t buy himself a castle and an estate in Eretz Yisroel, for it was prized by all, as it is said, @rr°@bb”The territory coveted by hordes of nations.” @d1They are Ephraim's myriads.@d2 Those gored. This refers to the myriads slain by Yehoshua, who was descended from Ephraim. @d1And they are Menasheh’s thousands.@d2 This refers to the thousands slain by Gideon at Midian, as it is said, “Zevach and Tsalmuna were at Karkor, etc.” @p118@p2<EN>Regarding Zevulun, he said.@p3 @rr°@bbWith the following five tribes whom he blessed last — Zevulun, Gad, Don, Naftoli, and Asher — the names were repeated, to strengthen and empower them, since they were the weakest of all the tribes. They were the ones whom Yoseif brought before Pharoah, as it is said, “From among his brothers, he took five men,” because they appeared weak, and he would not commission them as his military officers. @d1Rejoice, Zevulun, at your departure, and Yisachar in your tents.@d2 @rr°@bbZevulun and Yisachar entered into a partnership. “Zevulun shall reside at the sea coast”; he departs to engage in maritime trade, gain profit, and provide sustenence for Yissachar, while they remained occupied with Torah study. Zevulun therefore precedes Yissachar, as Yissachar’s Torah was made possible by Zevulun. @d1Rejoice Zevulun at your departure.@d2 Gain success when you depart to engage in trade. @d1And Yissachar.@d2 Gain success when you remain in your tents studying Torah, convening to decide on the leap year, and fix the months, as it is said, “Of the sons of Yissachar, profoundly knowledgeable in [fixing] the times, etc.” Their leaders, two hundred chief justices of the Sanhedrin, were occupied with this. Based on their arrangement of the time [divisions] and of the leap year — @p119@p2<EN>Peoples.@p3 Of the tribes of Yisroel. @d1Shall assemble [lit. invite] at the mountain.@d2 @rr°@bbThey shall assemble at Mount Moriah — every assembly being by invitation — @rr°@bband there slaughter, during the festivals, righteous offerings. @d1For by the streaming of the sea they shall be nurtured.@d2 Yisachar and Zevulun, @rr°@bbaffording them the opportunity to engage in the study of Torah. @d1And the hidden treasures of sand.@d2 Concealed, immersed in the sands — @rr°@bbtuna, the chilazon fish, and white crystal-ware, which emerged from the sea and from the sands. This was in the portion of Yisachar and Zevulun. as stated in tractate Megillah, @rr°@bb”Zevulun, a people disdainful of their souls in seeking death,” because, “Naftoli, on the loftiest ground.” Zevulun lamented his fate, ‘To my brothers, you gave fields and vineyards, etc.’ @d1And the hidden treasures.@d2 The word denotes covering, as it is said, “He covered the building,” “covered with cedar,” @rr°@bbtranslated by Targum as “lined with a cedar covering.” @rr°@bbAnother interpretation. “Gentile nations shall assemble at the mountain,” as a result of Zevulun’s commerce, gentile merchants would visit his territory, which was situated at the border, and say, ‘Since we took the trouble to come this far, let’s proceed to Jerusalem, and examine this nation’s religion, and its customs.’ They would observe all of Yisroel worshipping one God, and eating the same food, for with the Gentiles, this one’s God differs from the other’s, and this one’s food differs from the other’s. Then they would say, ‘No nation is as virtuous as this,’ and they would convert on the spot, as it is said, “there they slaughtered righteous offerings. @d1For by the streaming of the sea they shall be nurtured.@d2 Zevulun and Yissachar, to whom the sea streamed abundant wealth. @p120@p2<EN>Blessed is the One who broadens Gad.@p3 This teaches that @rr°@bbthe breadth of Gad’s border ranged eastward. @d1He lairs like a lion.@d2 @rr°@bbBecause he was near the border, he is therefore compared to the lions, for all those near the border must be supremely powerful. @d1Then rips the arm with the head.@d2 Their killings were recognizable, as they severed arm and head with a single blow. @p121@p2<EN>He saw the foremost for himself.@p3 He saw fit to take, for himself, a portion @rr°@bbin the territory of Sichon and Og, which was foremost in the conquest of the land. @d1For there the [great scribe’s] burial plot.@d2 @rr°@bbFor he knew that there, in his territory, was the plot of the great scribe’s burial ground. This refers to Moshe. @d1Is concealed.@d2 @rr°@bbThat plot is concealed, hidden from all creatures, as it is said, “and no man knows his burial place.” @d1He marched.@d2 Gad. @d1At the head of the people.@d2 They marched at the front ranks of the armed forces when the land was conquered, since they were great warriors, as it is said, “You shall cross as the armed force before your brothers.” @d1He acted righteously before Adonoy.@d2 As they were faithful to their word, and kept their promise to cross the Yardein until they conquered and distributed [the land]. @rr°@bbAnother interpretation: “He came” — Moshe. “At the head of the people,” “He acted righteously before Adonoy” — this refers to Moshe.<QC>
@p122@p2<EN>Don is a lion cub.@p3 He, too, was near the border, and is therefore compared to lions. @d1Bounding from Bashan.@d2 As Targum [Onkelos] renders, @rr°@bbthe Yardein originated from his portion, @rr°@bbfrom the cavern of Pamias — this is Leshem, which is in Don’s portion, @rr°@bbas it is said, “They called Leshem ‘Don.”’ @rr°@bbIt bounds forth, flowing from Bashan. @rr°@bbAnother interpretation: Just as the bounding flow emanates from a single source, and then divides into two areas, so it is with the tribe of Don — they received a portion in two areas. They first received, in the northwest, Ekron and its environs, but this was insufficient for them, so they went to war with Leshem, which is Pamias. This is at the northeast, for the Yardein originates from the cavern of Pamias, at the east of Eretz Yisroel, flows from north to south, and terminates at the edge of the Dead Sea. This is the east of Yehudah, who received in the south of Eretz Yisroel, as detailed in the book of Yehoshua. This is what is meant by the statement, “The border of the sons of Don extended past them, for the sons of Don went up to war with Leshem, etc.” Their border extended past the entire direction in which they had begun to settle. @p123@p2<EN>Desire is satisfied.@p3 His land fully satisfied the desires of its residents. @d1Occupy the sea and its southern coast.@d2 The Sea of Kineres fell to him as his portion. @rr°@bbHe also took a measure of fully spread fishnet rope on its southern coast, so that he could spread nets and traps. @d1Occupy.@d2 The imperative usage, as in, “Go up and occupy.” The accent on the upper syllable, at the @hh<HEB>ר'@ee<ENG>, verifies this, like @hh<HEB>ירש@ee<ENG>, occupy; @hh<HEB>ידע@ee<ENG>, know; @hh<HEB>לקח@ee<ENG> , take; @hh<HEB>שמע@ee<ENG>, hear. When the @hh<HEB>ה'@ee<ENG> is added, the upper syllable is accentuated — @hh<HEB>שְׁמָעָה@ee<ENG>, hear; @hh<HEB>יְדָעָה@ee<ENG>, know; @hh<HEB>סְלָחָה@ee<ENG>, forgive; @hh<HEB>לְקָחָה@ee<ENG>, take. Here too, “occupy” — the imperative usage. Indeed, in the comprehensive traditional grammar guide, we find, in the alphabet section, that, in the imperative usage, the upper syllable is accentuated.<QC>
@p124@p2<EN>May Asher be blessed with sons.@p3 I have seen in Sifrei, ‘Not one, among all the tribes, was as blessed with sons as Asher,’ but I do not know how. @d1He shall be favored by his brothers.@d2 @rr°@bbHe found favor with his brothers with elixir of onapekin and delicious foods, and they favored him with produce. @rr°@bbAnother interpretation: “He shall be favored by his brothers,” since his daughters were beautiful. This corresponds with the statement in Divrei Hayamim, @rr°@bb”He was the father of Birzayis,” as they were married to @ITKohanim Gedolim@it and kings annointed with olive oil. @d1And immerse his foot in oil.@d2 As his territory flowed with oil like a wellspring. There was an incident where the residents of Ludekia needed oil. @rr°@bbThey appointed an emissary, etc., as stated in Menachos. @p125@p2<EN>Your locks are iron and copper.@p3 He now speaks in relation to all of Israel, as their great warriors resided in the border cities, and locked it against invasion by the enemy as if it had been sealed with locks and bolts of iron and copper. @rr°@bbAnother interpretation: Your locks are iron and copper, your territory is locked by mountains from which iron and copper are quarried. @rr°@bbAsher locked-in Eretz Yisroel. @d1As the days [of your youth], so may be your declining days.@d2 As the days of your well-being, meaning your early, youthful days; so may be the days of your old age, @rr°@bbwhich [generally] flow downward, droop, and decline. @rr°@bbAnother interpretation: According to your days, shall be your stream. According to your days which are beneficial to you — according to the number of your days, all the days when you fulfill the Omnipresent’s wishes — shall be your stream, as all the countries shall stream silver and gold to Eretz Yisroel, for she shall be blessed with bountiful produce, and all the countries shall receive their sustenance from her, and deliver to her their silver and gold. @ITEscoront,@it streaming. Their silver and gold will be depleted, for they will cause it to flow to your land. @p126@p2<EN>God is incomparable — Yeshurun.@p3 Know, Yeshurun, @rr°@bbthat none is comparable to God, among all the Gentile deities, for, not like your Almighty is theirs. @d1He who straddles the firmament.@d2 @rr°@bbHe is the God who comes to your assistance. and, in His pride, straddles the high heavens.<QC>
@p127@p2<EN>As the dwelling of the eternal God.@p3 @rr°@bbThe heavens are as the dwelling of the eternal God, who preceded all the deities, and chose, for Himself, the heavens as His residence and dwelling. @rr°@bbBelow His dwelling, all the strong-armed reside. @d1The world’s strong-<FJ> armed.@d2 Sichon, Og, and the kings of Canaan, who were the world’s mighty and powerful, therefore, quaked and trembled involuntarily, their strength dissipating before Him — the exalted are always fearsome to the lowly. It is thus that His might and power come to your assistance.<QC>
@d1He banished the enemy from your presence@d2 @rr°@bband said to you, “Destroy!” them.@d2 @d1As the dwelling.@d2 With all words requiring @hh<HEB>ל'@ee<ENG> as a prefix, @hh<HEB>ה'@ee<ENG> may be used as a suffix. @p128@p2<EN>Securely, as individuals.@p3 @rr°@bbEach and every individual, “Every one under his grapevine and under his fig tree,” dispersed, without needing to assemble and remain together because of the enemy. @d1Like Yaakov.@d2 @rr°@bbAs in, “Its likeness was similar to crystal.” Like the blessing bestowed on them by Yaakov, @rr°@bbnot like the isolation Yirmiyahu mentioned, “I sat in isolation.” Rather, like the assurance given them by Yaakov, “God will be with you, and bring you back to the land of your forefathers.” @d1Shall drip.@d2 Shall drip. @d1Even its skies shall drip dew.@d2 Also, Yitzchak’s blessing, in addition to Yaakov’s blessing — “May God grant you of the dew of heaven, etc.” @p129@p2<EN>You are fortunate, Yisroel.@p3 After blessing them specifically, he said to them, ‘Why must I be specific with you? The general theme is, everything is yours.’ @d1You are fortunate Yisroel, who can compare to you?@d2 @rr°@bbYour salvation is in Adonoy, who is the shield of your aid and the sword of your glory. @d1Your enemies will prevaricate to you.@d2 For example, the Givonites, who said, “Your servants have come from a distant land, etc.” @d1While you tread on their high places.@d2 As it is said, “Place your feet on the necks of these kings.” @p11@p2<EN>From the plains of Moav to Mount Nevo.@d2 @rr°@bbThere were a number of elevations, but Moshe vaulted them in a single leap. @d1The entire land.@d2 @rr°@bbHe showed him all of Eretz Yisroel in its tranquility, and the oppressors who are destined to afflict it. @d1Till Don.@d2 He showed him the idolatrous sons of Don, as it is said, “The sons of Don established for themselves the idol.” And He showed him Shimshon, who was destined to descend from him as a saviour. @p12@p2<EN>And all of Naftoli.@p3 He showed him his territory in its tranquility and its desolation, and He showed him Devorah and Barak of Kedesh Naftoli, waging war with Sisera and his legions. @d1The land of Ephraim and Menasheh.@d2 He showed him their territory in its tranquility and its desolation. He showed him Yehoshua waging war with the kings of Canaan — as he was descended from Ephraim, and Gideon, who was descended from Menasheh, waging war with Midian and Amalek. @d1And all of the land of Yehudah.@d2 In its tranquility and its desolation. And He showed him the royal house of Dovid, and their triumphs. @d1Up until the rearward Sea.@d2 The western territory, in its tranquility and its desolation. Another interpretation: Don’t read “the rearward Sea,” but “the final day.” The Holy One, Blessed is He, showed him all the events that are destined to befall Yisroel until the rejuvenation of the dead. @p13@p2<EN>And the Negev.@p3 The southern territory. Another interpretation: The Cave of Machpelah, as it is said, “They went up at the Negev, and he proceeded until Chevron.” @d1And the plain.@d2 He showed him Shlomo casting the vessels for the Beis Hamikdosh, as it is said, “In the plain of the Yardein the king cast them, below the surface of the ground.” @p14@p2<EN>Saying, ‘I will give it to your descendants’. I have shown it to you.@p3 @rr°@bbSo that you may go forth and say to Avrohom, Yitzchak, and Yaakov, ‘The oath which the Holy One, may He be blessed, pronounced to you has been fulfilled.’ This is [the inference of] “saying” — for this reason I have showed it to you. @rr°@bbHowever, it has been decreed before Me that you shall not make the passage there. @rr°@bbWere it not for this, I would have sustained you until you would have observed them implanted and established in it, so that you could have gone forward and related this to them. @p15@p2<EN>Moshe died there.@p3 Is it possible that Moshe died, yet he wrote “Moshe died there”? Rather, until this point Moshe wrote, beyond this point, Yehoshua wrote. R’ Meir said, ‘Is it possible that the book of the Torah was incomplete when he said, “Take this book of the Torah”? Rather, the Holy One, Blessed is He, dictated, @rr°@bbwhile Moshe wrote with teardrops. @d1By the mouth of Adonoy.@d2 With a kiss. @p16@p2<EN>He buried him.@p3 @rr°@bbThe Holy One, Blessed is He, in His glory. R’ Yishmael said, he buried himself. This is one of three “him” wordings which R’ Yishmael interpreted this way. Similarly, “When the days of nazirite status are fulfilled he shall bring ‘him”’ — he brings himself. Similarly, “They burden ‘them’ with the sin of their guilt.” Can others burden them? Rather, they burden themselves. @d1Facing Beis Peor.@d2 His grave had been readied there since the six days of creation, to atone for the incident at Peor. This was one of the objects created on the eve of Shabbos at twilight.<QC>
@p17@p2<EN>His appearance was not dulled.@p3 Even after he died. @d1And his freshness did not fade.@d2 @rr°@bbHis moistness. He was not subject to decay, his countenance was not disfigured. @p18@p2<EN>Bnei [the sons of] Yisroel.@p3 The males. But with Aharon, because he pursued peace — making peace between neighbors, between women and their husbands — it is said, “The entire house of Yisroel” — male and female.<QC>
@p110@p2<EN>Whom Adonoy knew face-to-face.@p3 @rr°@bbHe [Moshe] had an easy familiarity with Him, and could speak with Him any time he desired, as it is said, “Now I will go up to Adonoy,” “Wait, while I hear His command to you.” @p112@p2<EN>For the entire strong hand.@p3 @rr°@bbHe received the Torah in the tablets with his hands. @d1And for the entire great display.@d2 The miracles and mighty deeds in the immense, awesome wilderness. @d1In view of all of Yisroel.@d2 @rr°@bbWhen he took the liberty of shattering the tablets before their eyes, as it is said, “I shattered them before your eyes.” @rr°@bbThe Holy One, Blessed is He consented to his opinion, as it is said, “which you shattered” — ‘More power to you for shattering them!’<QC>
