@p149@p2<EN>However, the tribe of Levi you shall not count.@p3 The King’s legion is worthy of being @rr°@bbcounted separately. @rr°@bbAnother interpretation; the Holy One, blessed is He, foresaw that a decree would arise against all those who were counted from the age of twenty and above to die in the desert. He [therefore] said, “Let these [Levites] not be included, for they are mine, since they did not sin with the [golden] calf.” @p150@p2<EN>You shall appoint the Levites.@p3 As Targum [Onkelos] translates, “appoint.” The word denotes appointment to @rr°@bbauthority over the subject of one’s appointment, as, “and let the king appoint officials.” (Esther 2)<QC>

@p11@p2<EN>These are the descendants of Aharon and Moshe.@p3 [Scripture] mentions only the sons of Aharon, yet they are called the descendants of Moshe — because he taught them Torah.

@p18@p2<EN>And the watch of Bnei Yisroel.@p3 They were all actually obligated to provide the needs of the Sanctuary; the Levites merely served in their place, as surrogates.

Because the sacred service was [originally performed] by the firstborn, but when they sinned with the golden calf, they were disqualified. The Levites, who did not indulge in idolatry, were chosen instead. @p115@p2<EN>From the age of one month and above.@p3 When he (the infant) can no longer be categorized as stillborn, he is listed among those entitled “guardian of the sacred watch.” R’ Yehudah B’rabi Shalom said, “This [Levite] tribe is regularly counted from the womb, as it is said, “.<TIE>.<TIE>. [Yocheved, Levi’s daughter] .<TIE>.<TIE>. whom she (Levi’s wife) bore to Levi in Egypt .<TIE>.<TIE>.” While entering the portals of Egypt, @rr°@bbshe bore her (Yocheved). yet she is counted among the seventy souls [who came down to Egypt]. for, when one tallies their total, one finds only sixty-nine and she completed the total. @p116@p2<EN>According to the word of Adonoy.@p3 Moshe said before the Holy One, Blessed is He, @rr°@bb”How can I enter into their tents to determine the number of their nursing infants”?

Because they were neighbors of Moshe, who engaged in Torah [study], they became great Torah scholars, as it is said, “Yehudah my lawgiver”; “From the sons of Yissachar of sagacious knowledge, etc.” — [this refers to] two hundred heads of Sanhedrin; “and from Zevulun, came those that handle the scribe’s quill.” @p139@p2<EN>Whom Moshe and Aharon counted.@p3 @rr°@bbThere are dots over [the word] @hh<HEB>וְאַהֲרֹן@ee<ENG>, to teach that he was not included in the counting of the Levites. @d1Twenty two thousand.@d2 When counting them individually, however, one discovers three hundred extra: the sons of Gershon, seven thousand five hundred; the sons of Kehos, eight thousand six hundred; the sons of Merori, six thousand two hundred [hence, twenty two thousand three hundred]. Why aren’t they included among the rest to redeem the firstborn, thus exempting the two hundred seventy three overlapping firstborn from redemption? Our sages answered, in Maseches Bechoros, that the three hundred Levites were, themselves, firstborn. It was sufficient @rr°@bbfor them to release themselves from redemption. @p140@p2<EN>Count every male firstborn .<TIE>.<TIE>. from the age of one month and above.@p3 When he (the infant) can no longer be categorized as stillborn.<QC>

Many other homiletical interpretations are offered by Sifri. Midrash Aggadah [states], “A man’s sacred objects shall be his” [states]: If someone withholds his tithes, and refuses to give them, [then] “[they shall] be his” — the tithes.

We find a similarity with regard to [king] David, because he utterly dedicated himself to the construction of the Beis Ha Mikdash — as it is said: “Remember, Adonoy, unto David all his afflictions; how he swore to Adonoy .<TIE>.<TIE>. etc. it was, therefore, called by his name, as it is said: “Observe your House, David.” @d1[On the day] Moshe finished erecting.@d2 It does not say, “On the day [Moshe] erected .<TIE>.<TIE>.” This teaches that throughout the seven days of installation Moshe erected and dismantled it, and on that day, he erected it without dismantling it. This is why it says, “On the day Moshe finished erecting” — that day his erecting ended. It was the first of the month of Nisan. @rr°@bbOn the second, the [red] cow was burned, on the third, they sprinkled with the first sprinkling, @rr°@bband on the seventh, [after having been sprinkled again] they were shaven.<QC>
@p12@p2<EN>They were the leaders of the tribes.@p3 @rr°@bbThey were officers over them in Egypt, and were beaten because of them, as it is said: “And the officers of the Israelites were beaten, etc.” @d1They stood by during the counting.@d2 They stood with Moshe and Aharon when they counted [Bnei] Yisroel, as it is said, “with you [Moshe and Aharon], shall be.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p13@p2<EN>Six covered wagons.@p3 @hh<HEB>צָב@ee<ENG> can only mean “covered.” Similarly, “[They will bring your brothers from all the nations .<TIE>.<TIE>. with horses and chariots] @hh<HEB>וּבַצַּבִּים וּבַפְּרָדִים@ee<ENG>,” “in covered wagons and on mules . <TIE>.<TIE>.” Covered wagons are called @hh<HEB>צַבִּים@ee<ENG>. [Some interpret @hh<HEB>צָב@ee<ENG> in the sense of @hh<HEB>הַצְבִי יִשְׂרָאֵל @ee<ENG>, (“The finest in Israel.”) They (the wagons) were fine looking.] @d1They placed them before the @BIMishkon.@it@d2 @rr°@bbBecause Moshe did not accept [the gift] from their hands until [so] instructed by the omnipresent [God.] R’ Noson said, “Why did the leaders see fit to contribute here at the outset, but for the materials of the @ITMishkon,@it they did not contribute at the outset? Because the leaders said as follows: “Let the community contribute as they wish, and any shortfall, we will furnish.” But when they saw that the community had supplied everything, as it is said, “the material was sufficient,” they said, “Now what can we do”? They brought the onyx stones, and the stones set into the @ITephod@it and breastplate.

@p111@p2<EN>They shall bring forth their offering for the dedication of the altar.@p3 But Moshe still did not know how they were to bring the offerings — whether in order of their birth, or in order of the traveling — until the Holy One, Blessed is He, told him that they should bring the offerings according to the traveling, each in his day. @p112@p2<EN>On the first day.@d2 That day took ten crowns; [it fell on] the first [day] of creation, first of the leaders, etc., as recorded in Seder Olam. @d1Of the tribe of Yehudah.@d2 Scripture establishes his tribal kinship; @rr°@bbbut not that he solicited [payment] from his tribe and then brought [the offering]. But perhaps I should say @hh<HEB>לְמַטֵּה יְהוּדָה@ee<ENG>, “for the tribe of Yehudah,” [teaching] that he solicited payment from his tribe and then brought [the offering]? The Torah therefore teaches “this is Nachshon’s offering.” He brought his own. @p113@p2<EN>Both were filled with fine flour.@p3 @rr°@bbAs a voluntary meal-offering. @p114@p2<EN>[Of] ten gold [@ITshekolim@it].@p3 As Targum [Onkelos] interprets, @rr°@bbthe weight of ten @ITshekolim@it by the Sanctuary standard was in it. @d1Filled with incense.@d2 @rr°@bbWe do not find incense [brought] by an individual, nor [brought] on the outer altar, except for this one alone.

@p116@p2<EN>One he-goat as a sin-offering.@p3 @rr°@bbTo atone for [defilement by passing over] the grave of the abyss — [for] indefinite defilement. @p118–19@p2<EN>Nesanel the son of Tzu’ar brought forward — he brought forward his offering.@p3 What does the Torah teach [by saying] “he brought forward” with respect to the tribe of Yissachar, without having said it with respect to all the [other] tribes? Because Reuven came with a complaint, saying ‘Enough that Yehudah preceded me! Let me bring my offering after him.’ Moshe said to him, By the Almighty ‘It was told to me that they should bring the offerings in the order of the journeys, according to their banners.’ This is why it says @hh<HEB>אֶת קָרְבָּנוֹ@ee<ENG> “@hh<HEB>הִקְרִב@ee<ENG>,” without the “@ITyud@it,” inferring @hh<HEB>הַקְרֵב@ee<ENG>, “you shall bring forward!” — the imperative usage, since Moshe was commanded by the Almighty, “@hh<HEB>הַקְרֵב@ee<ENG>.” What is [the inference of] “[Nesanel] brought forward,” [“he brought forward”] twice? Because there were two reasons by which he merited bringing his offering second among the tribes. One, because of their (his tribe’s) knowledge of Torah, as it is said, “From the sons of Yissachar, of sagacious, timely knowledge.” And one, because they advised the leaders to donate these offerings. In R’ Moshe Hadarshan’s commentary I found: “R’ Pinchos ben Yair said: ‘Nesanel the son of Tzu'ar offered this advice.”’ @d1Silver tray.@p3 Its letters are numerically equivalent to @rr°@bb930, corresponding to the years of Adam.<QC>
@d1Its weight was one hundred thirty [@ITshekolim@it].@d2 Alluding that when he (Adam) fathered progeny to sustain the world, he was one hundred thirty years old, as it is said: “Adam lived one hundred thirty years, and fathered .<TIE>.<TIE>. etc.” @d1One silver bowl.@d2 The numerical value is 520, alluding to Noach, who fathered his progeny at the age of 500, and alluding to the 20 years by which the decree for the flood preceded his progeny, as I explained [the verse] “His days shall be a hundred and twenty years.” This is why it says @hh<HEB>מִזְרָק אֶחָד כֶּסֶף@ee<ENG>, but does not say @hh<HEB>מִזְרַק כֶּסֶף אֶחָד@ee<ENG>, as it says concerning the tray — to teach that the letters of @hh<HEB>אֶחָד@ee<ENG> are also included in the calculation. @d1Seventy @BIshekolim.@it@d2 Corresponding to the 70 nations which emerged from his (Noach’s) sons. @p120@p2<EN>One spoon (lit. hand).@p3 Corresponding to the Torah, which was given from the hand of the Holy One, Blessed is He. @d1Ten gold [@BIshekolim@BO].@d2 Corresponding to the ten commandments. @d1Filled with incense.@d2 The numerical value of @hh<HEB>קְטֹרֶת@ee<ENG>, is 613, corresponding to the 613 commandments — provided you convert the @hh<HEB>קו"ף@ee<ENG> into a @hh<HEB>דל"ת@ee<ENG>, by using @hh<HEB>א"ת ב"ש ג"ר ד"ק@ee<ENG>.<QC>

Until here, [my remarks are] from the commentary of R’ Moshe Hadarshan. @p124@p2<EN>On the third day, the leader etc.@p3 @rr°@bbOn the third day, the leader who brought the offering was from the sons of Zevulun, and so with all of them. But with Nesanel, concerning whom it is said, “Nesanel brought forth,” the proper succeeding words are “leader of Yissachar,” since it has already mentioned his name and that he brought. With the others, about whom it does not say “he brought,” the proper words are these: “the leader of the children of so-and-so,” that day, the leader who brought was from the tribe of so-and-so.<QC>
@p184@p2<EN>On the day it was anointed.@p3 On the very day it was anointed, he (each leader) brought the offering. Then how do I justify “after it was anointed”? [To teach] That it was anointed first, and then he brought the offering. But, perhaps “after it was anointed” [means] after a time, and “on the day it was anointed” merely teaches that it was anointed by day? When it says “on the day they were anointed,” we learn that it was anointed by day. Then why does the Torah write “on the day it was anointed”? @rr°@bbOn the day it was anointed, he brought the offering. @d1Twelve silver trays.@d2 @rr°@bbThese were the very ones that were donated, none were disqualified. @p185@p2<EN>One hundred thirty [@BIshekolim@BO was the weight of] each tray.@p3 Why does the Torah say this? Because it said “one hundred thirty [@ITshekolim@it was] its weight,” but does not explain @rr°@bbby which @ITshekel@it standard. Therefore, Scripture repeats it here, and includes everything — “all the silver of the vessels” — in the @ITshekel@it of the sacred standard. @d1All the silver vessels, etc.@d2 This teaches you that the Sanctuary vessels were weighed with @rr°@bbprecision. Whether weighed individually or collectively, there was neither excess nor shortfall. @p186@p2<EN>Twelve golden spoons.@p3 Why is this said? Because it says, “one spoon of ten gold,” [meaning] @rr°@bbit was golden, and it weighed ten silver @ITshekolim@it. But perhaps [it means] one silver spoon, weighing ten golden @ITshekolim@it — and the golden @ITshekolim@it are not the same weight as the silver ones? — The Torah therefore writes “golden spoons” — they (the spoons) were gold.<QC>
@p189@p2<EN>When Moshe would enter.@p3 When two passages conflict, a third decides between them. One passage says: “God spoke to him from the Tent of Meeting” — this was outside the @ITparoches@it partition. And one passage says: “I will speak to you from above the cover [of the Ark].” This [passage] comes and decides between them. Moshe came to the Tent of Meeting. There he heard the Voice coming from above the cover.<QC>
@d1Between the two cherubs.@d2 The Voice emanated from heaven to the space between the two cherubs, and from there to the Tent of Meeting. @d1He would hear the Voice.@d2 Perhaps the Voice was low (of a lesser degree)? The Torah therefore writes @hh<HEB>אֶת הַקּוֹל@ee<ENG>, “the Voice” —  the Voice spoken to him at Sinai. But when it reached the doorway, it ceased, and did not go out of the tent. @d1Being spoken.@d2 As being spoken unto Itself. It is respectful to the One above to speak thusly. He was speaking to Himself, and Moshe was listening in. @d1He spoke to him.@d2 This excludes Aharon from the communications.<QC>
@p12@p2<EN>When you light.@p3 Why is the @ITparshah@it of the Menorah adjacent to the @ITparshah@it of the leaders? Because when Aharon saw the leaders’ dedication (offerings) he was humiliated, since he did not join them in the dedication, neither he nor his tribe. The Holy One, Blessed is He, said to him, “By your life, yours is greater than theirs! For you will light and cleanse the lamps.” @d1When you light (lit. cause to rise).@d2 @rr°@bbBecause the flame rises, igniting is described in terms of “rising.” He is required to ignite [the lamp] until the flame rises by itself. In addition, the Rabbis derive from here @rr°@bbthat there was a platform before the Menorah, @rr°@bbupon which the @ITkohein@it stood when he lit [the lamps]. @d1Toward the face of the Menorah.@d2 Toward the middle lamp which was not on one of the branches, but on the Menorah itself. @d1Shall the seven lamps cast [their] light.@d2 The six [lamps] that were on the six branches [and one on its stem]. The three eastern ones turned toward the middle [by] @rr°@bbtheir wicks. Similarly, the three western ones — the heads of their wicks [were] towards the middle. Why? So that it whould not be said that He (God) needs the light. @p13@p2<EN>Aharon did so.@p3 @rr°@bbTo indicate his [Aharon’s] virtue — he did not digress.<QC>
@p14@p2<EN>This is how the Menorah was made.@p3 The Holy One, Blessed is He, showed him (Moshe) by pointing [as one would point] with the finger, @rr°@bbsince he had difficulty with it. This is why it says @hh<HEB>וְזֶה@ee<ENG> (“This”). @d1Beaten.@d2 @ITBatedic@it (hammered) in Old French, meaning the same as @hh<HEB>דָּא לְדָא נָקְשָׁן@ee<ENG>, (“they struck one another”). There was a @rr°@bblump of gold, [weighing] a @ITkikar,@it [which] he beat with a hammer and cut with @rr°@bbshears to extend its (the Menorah’s) limbs properly; but it was not made limb by limb and [then] connected. @d1From its base until its flowers.@d2 Its base was the hollow box over the legs, hollowed like the silver candelabras before princes. @d1From its base until its flowers.@d2 As if to say, @rr°@bb”The Menorah proper, in its entirety, and all its dependent parts.” @d1From its base.@d2 Which was a large limb. @d1Until its flowers.@d2 Its most @rr°@bbdelicate work — it was all one piece. @hh<HEB>עַד@ee<ENG> (“until”), is customarily used in this sense, like “From the harvested crop, until the standing grain, and until the olive grove.” @d1According to the vision which [Adonoy] showed<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. @d2 @rr°@bbAccording to the form which He showed him on the mountain (Sinai), as it is said: “Observe and make them according to the form.<TIE>.<TIE>.etc.” @d1So he made the Menorah.@d2 @rr°@bbThe one who made it. But Midrash Aggadah [states] by the Holy One, Blessed is He, @rr°@bbit was made spontaneously. @p16@p2<EN>Take the Levites.@p3 @rr°@bbTake them with words of persuasion, “you are fortunate to merit becoming servants of the Omnipresent.”<QC>
@p17@p2<EN>Sprinkle them with the sin-offering waters.@p3 Of the ashes of the red cow, @rr°@bbfor some of them were defiled by contact with the dead. @d1And cause a razor to pass.@d2 I found in R’ Moshe Hadarshan’s remarks: “Because they were given in atonement for the firstborn @rr°@bbwho practiced idolatry, which is referred to as ‘sacrificing to the dead,’ and since the leper is considered dead, they required shaving like lepers.” @p18@p2<EN>They should take a young bullock.@p3 This was a burnt-offering, as it is written, “he should make .<TIE>.<TIE>. one a burnt-offering.” This is the communal sacrifice for idolatry. @d1And a second bullock.@d2 @rr°@bbWhat does the Torah teach [by specifying] ‘a second’? To inform you that, just as the burnt-offering was not eaten, so was the sin-offering not eaten. This supports his remarks, from Toras Kohanim. Now I say @rr°@bbthat it was a temporary ruling, as they should have brought a goat as a sin-offering for idolatry with the burnt-<FJ> offering bull. @p19@p2<EN>And you shall gather the entire congregation@p3 Since the Levites are given as an atonement-offering in their place, let them come @rr°@bband stand near their offering and rest their hands on them.<QC>
@p111@p2<EN>Aharon shall wave the Levites as a wave-offering@p3 Just as the leper’s guilt-<FJ> offering @rr°@bbrequires waving when it is still alive. @rr°@bbThree wavings were stated in this chapter: The first, of the sons of Kehos. Therefore it is stated of them: “They will be [entrusted] to do the worship of Adonoy,” since the work of the holiest is upon them — the Ark and the Table etc. The second, of the sons of Gershon. It is therefore stated of them: “A wave-offering to Adonoy,” for even they were entrusted with holy work — tapestries and the hooks which were seen in the Holy of Holies. And the third, of the sons of Merori.<QC>
@p116@p2<EN>They are given; they are given.@p3 Given for carrying, given for singing. @d1@HB<HEB>פִּטְרַת@ee@d2<ENG> The opening of. @p117@p2<EN>For every first born is Mine.@p3 The first born were Mine by the rules of justice, @rr°@bbsince I protected them among the Egyptian firstborn. So I took them for Myself — until they strayed with the [golden] calf. Now I have taken the Levites.<QC>
@p119@p2<EN>I have given the Levites, etc.@p3 @rr°@bbBnei Yisroel are mentioned five times, in this passage, to make their preciousness known. They are remembered repeatedly in a single passage to correspond with the number of the five books of the Torah. I saw this in Bereishis Rabbah. @d1So that there will not be a plague among Bnei Yisroel.@d2 So that they will not need @rr°@bbto approach the Holy, for if they approach, there will be a plague. @p120@p2<EN>Moshe, Aharon, and the entire congregation did, etc.@p3 Moshe placed them, Aharon waved them, and @rr°@bbthe Israelites rested their hands. @p122@p2<EN>Just as Adonoy commanded, etc. so they did.@p3 This indicates the praiseworthiness of those who did, and those with whom it was done — @rr°@bbno one objected.<QC>
@p124@p2<EN>This concerns the Levites.@p3 Age disqualifies them, but physical deformity does not disqualify them. @d1From the age of twenty-five.@d2 But elsewhere it says, “From the age of thirty.” How is this reconciled? From the age of twenty-five he begins to study of the laws of the service. He studies for five years, and serves at the age of thirty. From here [we derive] that a pupil who does not see @rr°@bbfavorable indications in his studies for five years will never see (them). @p125@p2<EN>And shall no longer work.@p3 At the task of carrying @rr°@bbon the shoulder, but he returns to lock the gates, to sing, and to load the wagons. This is [the meaning of] “But he shall serve @IThis@it brethren,” ‘@ITwith@it his brethren’, as Targum [Onkelos] renders. @p126@p2<EN>To keep the watch.@p3 To camp around the Tent, and erect and dismantle [it] during the journeys.<QC>
@p11@p2<EN>In the first month.@p3 The chapter at the beginning of this book @rr°@bbwas not said until Iyar. You learn, that there is no order of precedence or succession in the Torah. But why did He not begin with this [chapter]? Because it is to Yisroel’s discredit, @rr°@bbthat throughout the forty years that Yisroel was in the wilderness they offered no other @ITPesach@it-offering but this. @p12@p2<EN>In its proper time.@p3 Even on Shabbos; @rr°@bbeven during ritual uncleanliness.<QC>
@p13@p2<EN>According to all its statutes.@p3 @rr°@bbThese are the commandments pertaining to its body [i.e., the animal itself] a lamb; unblemished; male; a yearling. @d1And according to all its laws.@d2 These are commandments having a bearing on the animal but originate from another place (i.e., outside the animal) For example, the seven days of eating @ITmatzoh@it and of eliminating @ITchometz@it. ([An alternate text:] The commandments pertaining to its body — a lamb; unblemished; male; a yearling. Having a bearing on the animal; roasted over fire, its head with its knees and its inner organs. Outside its body — @ITmatzoh@it and eliminating @ITchometz.@it) @p14@p2<EN>Moshe spoke, etc.@p3 What does the Torah teach? Does it not say, “Moshe spoke @rr°@bbof God’s holidays”? Evidently, when he heard the @ITparshah@it of the holidays at Sinai, he told it to them, and then he reviewed it and exhorted them at the time it was to be performed. @p16@p2<EN>Before Moshe and before Aharon.@p3 When both were seated in the study hall, they approached them and asked. But it is untenable to say [that they asked them] one after the other, for if Moshe did not know, how would Aharon [know]?<QC>
@p17@p2<EN>Why should we be excluded.@p3 @rr°@bbHe (Moshe) said to them: “The sacred offerings cannot be brought during ritual impurity.” They said to him: “[But] let the blood be sprinkled on us by ritually pure @ITkohanim@it and the flesh eaten by those who are pure.” He said to them: “Wait, while I listen,” like a disciple assured of hearing from his master’s mouth. Fortunate is the mortal thus assured, for whenever he wished, he could speak with the Divine Presence. Now @rr°@bbthis chapter should appropriately have been said through Moshe, as is all the rest of the Torah. But these [people] gained the merit of having it said through them, because Providence brings about merit through the meritorious.<QC>
@p110@p2<EN>Or on a distant road.@p3 There is a dot over this, as if to say: Not that it was definitely distant, @rr°@bbbut that he was outside the threshold of the [Temple] courtyard thoughout the time for slaughtering [the Pesach]. [At] the second @ITPesach, @rr°@bbmatzoh@it and @ITchometz@it may be with him at home; it is not considered ‘@ITyom tov@it’; and @ITchometz@it is not prohibited except while he eats [the @ITkorbon@it].<QC>
@p114@p2<EN>If a proselyte dwells among you, and brings the Pesach-offering.@p3 Perhaps everyone who converts must immediately bring the @ITPesach@it-offering? The Torah therefore teaches, “One statute, etc<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Rather, this is its meaning: “If a proselyte dwells among you, and he comes to bring the @ITPesach@it-offering with his fellows, according to the statutes of the @ITPesach@it-offering and its laws shall he do.”<QC>
@p115@p2<EN>The @BIMishkon@BO [which served] as the Tent of Testimony.@p3 @rr°@bbThe @ITMishkon@it which was made to be a tent for the tablets of testimony. @d1There was over the @ITMishkon.@it@d2 Similar to, “would constantly be” over the @ITMishkon.@it @rr°@bbSimilarly, all the usages in the @ITparshah.@it<QC>
@p117@p2<EN>The Cloud was lifted.@p3 As Targum [Onkelos] renders, @hh<HEB>אִסְתַּלָּקוּת@ee<ENG>, (“was lifted”). Similarly, “the Cloud @rr°@bbwas lifted.” But it would be improper to write “According to when the Cloud rose,” “the Cloud rose,” because the connotation is not rising, but flowering and ascending, as in, “behold, a tiny cloud, like a man’s palm, rises from the sea.” @p118@p2<EN>On the word of Adonoy did they travel.@p3 We learned in [the Beraysa describing] the work of the @ITMishkon@it;@it When the Israelites were departing the Cloud column would fold, and extend over the tribe of Yehudah like a type of beam. They sounded the @ITtekiah, teruah,@it and @ITtekiah.@it But it did not proceed until Moshe intoned, “Rise, Adonoy<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Then the banner of the camp of Yehudah departed. @rr°@bbThis is in Sifri. @d1On the word of Adonoy did they camp.@d2 When the Israelites were camping, the Cloud column would mushroom upward and extend over the tribe of Yehudah like a type of protective covering. It did not separate until Moshe said, “Come to rest, Adonoy, among the myriads and thousands of Israel.” Thus you say, “on the order of Adonoy, through Moshe.” @p120@p2<EN>Sometimes (lit. there is).@p3 As if to say, “sometimes.” @d1A number of days.@d2 “a few days.”<QC>
@p122@p2<EN>Or a year.

Consequently, you say that they departed on the basis of three [initiatives]. By the word of the Holy One, Blessed is He; by the word of Moshe; and by the trumpets. @d1Beaten.@d2 From a [single] ingot you should make it, by beating [it] with a hammer. @p13@p2<EN>When they will blow them.@p3 Both of them. This is the signal for summoning the community, as it is said, “The entire community shall present itself to you at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.” @p14@p2<EN>But if they blow one of them.@p3 This is the signal for summoning the leaders, as it is said, “The leaders shall present themselves to you.” @rr°@bbThey, too, meet at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. @rr°@bbThis is derived by Scriptural comparison in Sifri. @p15@p2<EN>When you blow a @ITteruah.@it@d2 The signal for the camps to depart; @rr°@bb@ITtekiah, teruah@it @ITtekiah.@it This is how it is extrapolated by Sifri from the redundant passages.<QC>
@p17@p2<EN>But when gathering the congregation, etc.@p3 @rr°@bbSince it says, “they shall be used by you, to summon the congregation and to initiate departure of the camps” — [we derive that] just as, when summoning the community, the trumpeting is by two @ITkohanim@it with both [trumpets], as it is said, “they shall trumpet with them, etc .<TIE>.<TIE>.” so, when initiating the camps’ departure, with both. @rr°@bbPerhaps, just as, when initiating the camps’ departure, they sound the @ITtekiah, teruah,@it and @ITtekiah,@it so, too, when summoning the community, they sound the @ITtekiah, teruah,@it and @ITtekiah,@it thus leaving no differentiation between summoning the community and initiating the camps’ departure? The Torah therefore teaches, “But when gathering the congregation, etc.<TIE>.<TIE>.” to say that there is no @ITteruah@it for gathering the community. The same rule applies for the leaders. Here is a synopsis for all three: summoning the community with two, that of the leaders with one. Each of these has no @ITteruah.@it Initiating the camps’ departure with two, through the @ITteruah@it and @ITtekiah.@it @p18@p2<EN>The sons of Aharon .<TIE>.<TIE>. shall sound.@p3 For those summonings and departures.<QC>

@d1I am Adonoy your God.@d2 From here we learn [that we combine Adonoy’s] Majesty, remembrance, and the @ITshofar,@it as it is said, @rr°@bb”You shall blow” — hence the @ITshofar,@it “as a remembrance” — this is remembrance, “I am Adonoy your God” — this is Majesty, etc. @p111@p2<EN>In the second month.@p3 Thus you say that they spent @rr°@bbtwelve months minus ten days at Chorev, since on the first of the month of Sivan they encamped there and did not depart until the twentieth of Iyar the following year. @p112@p2<EN>On their journeys.@p3 According to the rules specified for the journeying of their banners — who was first, and who last. @d1In the desert of Paran.@d2 @rr°@bbKivros Hata’avoh was in the desert of Paran.

@p117@p2<EN>The @BIMishkon@BO was dismantled.@p3 When the banner of Yehudah was departing, Aharon and his sons entered, dismantled the @ITparoches,@it and covered the Ark with it, as it says, “Aharon and his sons shall enter when the camp is about to travel.” The sons of Gershon and the sons of Merori dismantled the @ITMishkon@it and loaded it onto the wagons [and traveled]. The Ark and the sacred vessels carried by the sons of Kehos remain covered, placed on poles, until the banner of the camp of Reuven departed. Afterward, “The Kehos family traveled.” @p121@p2<EN>Carriers of the sacred.@p3 Carriers of the sacred objects. @d1They erected the @BIMishkon.@it@d2 The sons of Gershon and the sons of Merori, @rr°@bbwho were preceded by @rr°@bbthe departure of two banners, would erect the @ITMishkon@it when the Cloud rested. The signal for making camp was observed by the banner of the camp of Yehudah. They camped while the sons of Kehos still traveled behind with the two final banners. The sons of Gershon and the sons of Merori would erect the Sanctuary, so that when the sons of Kehos arrived, they found it set in place, and brought in the Ark, Table, Menorah, and Altars. This is the sense of the passage: “They — the @ITMishkon@it’s@it erectors — erected it before the arrival of the sons of Kehos.”<QC>
@p125@p2<EN>The gatherer for all the camps.@p3 Talmud Yerushalmi [teaches]: Because the tribe of Don was heavily populated, they traveled last. If anyone lost property, it would return it to them. There is an opinion that @rr°@bbthey traveled in the shape of a box, derived from, “Just as they camped, so they traveled.” @rr°@bbAnother opinion is that they traveled in the shape of a beam, derived from “The gatherer for all the camps.” @p128@p2<EN>These are the journeys.@p3 @rr°@bbThis is the order of their journeys.<QC>
@d1They journeyed.@d2 @rr°@bbOn that day, they journeyed. @p129@p2<EN>Chovav.@p3 @rr°@bbThis was Yisro, as it is said, “Of the children of Chovav, the father-in-law of Moshe.” Then why does the Torah say, “They came to their father, Reuel”? This teaches that children call their grandfather “father.” He had many names. “Yisro” [lit. “additional”] because he added a chapter to the Torah; “Chovav” [lit. “one who cherishes”] because he cherished the Torah, etc .<TIE>.<TIE>. @d1We are journeying to the place.@d2 Immediately. @rr°@bbWithin three days, we enter the [holy] land. Because at this first journey, they traveled with the intention of entering Eretz Yisroel, but they sinned with the complainers. But why did Moshe include himself with them? Because the decree was not yet issued against him, @rr°@bband he thought he would enter. @p130@p2<EN>To my land and to my birthplace.@p3 @rr°@bbWhether for the sake of my properties, or for the sake of my family. @p131@p2<EN>Please do not forsake.@p3 @hh<HEB>נָא@ee<ENG> is a term indicating nothing but request, @rr°@bbso that they will not say Yisro did not convert out of devotion.

They said: “When the Israelites divided the land there was @rr°@bba fertile area of Yericho, five hundred @ITamos@it by five hundred @ITamos,@it which they left undivided.” They said: “The one in whose portion the Temple would be built would take it.” In the interim, they gave it to the children of Yisro, to Yonadav, the son of Rechav, as it is said, “The sons of Keini, Moshe’s father-in-law, went up from the city of the dates, etc .<TIE>.<TIE>.”<QC>
@p133@p2<EN>A journey of three days.@p3 Three days’ traveling distance, @rr°@bbthey traveled in one day, because the Holy One, Blessed is He, wanted to bring them into the land immediately. @d1The Ark of the Covenant of Adonoy traveled in front of them a journey of three days.@d2 This was the Ark which @rr°@bbwent with them to war, in which the broken Tablets were placed.

(Targum [Onkelos] renders “the leeks, etc.”) @p16@p2<EN>The manna before our eyes.@d2 Manna in the morning, manna in the evening. @p17@p2<EN>The manna is like coriander seed.@p3 The one who said this [verse] did not say the other. The Israelites said, ‘Nothing but the manna before our eyes.’ while the Holy One, Blessed is He, inscribed in the Torah, “But the manna was like coriander seed, etc.,” as if to say, ‘Look, those who walk the earth at the subject of My children’s complaint — the manna was precious for such and such a reason’. @d1Like coriander seed.@d2 @rr°@bbRound like coriander. “@ITAliendre@it” seed in Old French. @d1Crystal@d2 The name of a precious stone, “@ITcristal@it” [in Old French]. @p18@p2<EN>Strolled about.@p3 @hh<HEB>שִׁיוּט@ee<ENG> is interpreted strictly as strolling, “@ITesbaneier@it” [in Old French], without exertion. @d1They ground [it] with a millstone, etc.@d2 It never descended into the millstone, or the pot, or the mortar; @rr°@bbrather, its taste changed to ground, crushed, or cooked [foods]. @d1@HB<HEB>בַּפָּרוּר@ee<ENG>.@d2 Pot.<QC>
@d1@HB<HEB>לְשַׁד הַשָׁמֶן@ee<ENG>.@d2 The moisture of oil. This is how Donash explained it. Similar to this, “@hh<HEB>לְשַׁדִּי@ee<ENG> was overturned by the heat of summer.” @rr°@bbThe “@ITlamed@it” is part of the root, “My moisture was overturned by the heat of summer.” The Rabbis, however, explain it as a term meaning @hh<HEB>שָׁדַיִם@ee<ENG>, “breasts.” But @hh<HEB>שָׁדַיִם@ee<ENG> have no relation to oil. One cannot say that @hh<HEB>לְשַׁד הַשָׁמֶן@ee<ENG> is translated like @hh<HEB>וַיִשְׁמַן יְשׁוּרוּן@ee<ENG>, “The righteous were fattened,” for, if so, the “@hh<HEB>מ@ee<ENG>“ would be vocalized with a minor “@ITkametz@it” (“@ITtzeirei@it”) and the emphasis below, under the “@hh<HEB>מ@ee<ENG>.” Now that the “@hh<HEB>מ@ee<ENG>“ is vocalized with a minor “@ITpatach@it” (“@ITsegol@it”) and the emphasis is below the “@hh<HEB>ש@ee<ENG>,” it is translated as “oil.” The “@hh<HEB>ש@ee<ENG>“ is vocalized with a major “@ITkametz@it” (@IT”kametz”@it), but not with a minor “@ITpatach@it” (@IT”segol”@it), because it closes the passge. Another interpretation: @hh<HEB>לְשַׁד@ee<ENG> is an acronym, [spelling] @hh<HEB>לִ'ישׁ, שֶׁ'מֶן, דְּ'בַשׁ@ee<ENG>, @rr°@bbkneaded, oil, honey. [It was] like a loaf kneaded with oil and coated with honey. Onkelos’ translation, rendered “kneaded with oil,” @rr°@bbleans toward Donash’s interpretation, since a loaf kneaded with oil contains the moisture of oil. @p110@p2<EN>Weep according to their families.@p3 Every family gathered together and wept, to publicize their complaints openly. The Rabbis remark that @hh<HEB>לְמִשְׁפְּחוֹתָיו@ee<ENG> means “concerning family matters” — concerning @rr°@bbthe intimate relations forbidden to them. @p112@p2<EN>That You say [lit. will say].@p3 @rr°@bbThat You say to me, ‘carry it in your lap.’ Where did He say this to him? “Go, lead the people.” And it says, “He commanded them (Moshe and Aharon) to [lead] Bnei Yisroel” [even] on condition @rr°@bbthat they stone you and insult you. @d1To the land which You swore to their forefathers.@d2 You tell me @rr°@bbto carry them in my lap.<QC>
@p115@p2<EN>If this is the way You treat me.@p3 Moshe’s strength weakened @rr°@bblike a female’s when the Holy One, Blessed is He, showed him the punishment He would visit upon them for this. He said before Him: ‘If so, kill me first.’ @d1So that I will not see my evil.@d2 It should have written “their evil,” but Scripture euphemizes. This is @rr°@bbone of the “scribes’ adjustments” to the Torah, for the sake of euphemistic language adjustment. @p116@p2<EN>Gather for Me.@p3 Here is @rr°@bbthe reply to your complaint when you said, “I am unable, alone .<TIE>.<TIE>.” But where were the original elders? Had they not sat with them even in Egypt, as it says: “Go, gather the elders of Israel”? Evidently, they died at the fire of “Tav’erah.” They deserved this at Sinai, as it is written, “they gazed at God.” Because they acted frivolously, @rr°@bblike someone munching his loaf while speaking before the king. And this is [the meaning of] “They ate and drank.” But the Holy One, Blessed is He, did not want to cause grief during the giving of the Torah, so he punished them here. @d1Whom you know to be, etc.@d2 Those whom you recognize, as they were appointed @rr°@bbofficers over them in Egypt for the body breaking labor. They took pity on them, and were beaten for their sake, as it says, “The Israelite officers were beaten.” Let them be appointed now, in their greatness, just as they suffered when they were oppressed. @d1You shall take them.@d2 Take them verbally. “How fortunate you are to have been appointed as leaders over the Omnipresent’s children.” @d1And they shall stand there with you.@d2 So that the Israelites will see, and treat them as great men, reverently, saying: ‘How precious are those who entered with Moshe to hear the word from the mouth of the Holy One, Blessed is He.’ @p117@p2<EN>I will descend.@p3 This is @rr°@bbone of the ten descents inscribed in the Torah. @d1And I will speak with you.@d2 But not with them. @d1I will make greater.@d2 As Targum [Onkelos] renders, @hh<HEB>וַאֲרַבֵּי@ee<ENG>, @rr°@bb”I will make greater,” like, “But to the great men of Bnei Yisroel.” @d1And place it on them.@d2 To what was Moshe compared at that time? To a lamp set in a candelabra. Everyone lights from it, but none of its own brightness is diminished. @d1They will bear, along with you.@d2 Stipulate with them, on condition that they accept upon themselves the toil of my children, as they are troublesome and recalcitrant. @d1So that you need not bear it alone.@d2 Here is the reply to your statement, “I am unable, alone .<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p118@p2<EN>Prepare yourselves.@p3 @rr°@bbPrepare yourselves for punishment. Similarly, it says, “Prepare them for the day of killing.”<QC>
@p120@p2<EN>For a month of days.@p3 @rr°@bbThis was with the [comparatively] virtuous ones, who fell ill in their beds and afterwards expired. But with the wicked ones it says, “the meat was still between their teeth.” This is how it is taught by Sifri. Mechilta, however, teaches the reverse. The wicked ones ate and suffered for thirty days, but with the decent ones — the meat was still between their teeth. @d1Until it comes out of your nostrils.@d2 As Targum [Onkelos] translates, @rr°@bb”you are disgusted by it.” It will seem to you as if you gorged on it until it is expelled through the nose. @d1It will be repulsive to you.@d2 You will cast it away @rr°@bbmore readily than you welcomed. In R’ Moshe Hadarshan’s commentary I saw that, in a certain language, the sword is called “@ITzara@it.” @d1Adonoy Who is among you.@d2 If I had not planted My Presence among you, @rr°@bbyou would not have had the arrogance to enter into all these affairs. @p121@p2<EN>Six hundred thousand on foot.@p3 He was not concerned with counting in detail the remaining three thousand. R’ Moshe Hadarshan explains that only @rr°@bbthose who went out of Egypt, wept. @p122@p2<EN>Will sheep and cattle be slaughtered.@p3 This is one of four instances expounded upon by R’ Akiva, which R’ Shimon did not expound as he did. R’ Akiva said, “Six hundred thousand on foot, etc. and You say ‘I will give them meat to eat for a month of days’? Will sheep and cattle .<TIE>.<TIE>. ?” Everything according to the straightforward interpretation, who will satisfy them? This is similar to what is said, “And he has sufficient means for its redemption.” @rr°@bbNow which is worse, this, or, “listen, here, rebels!”? Yet, since he did not say it publicly, Scripture spared him and did not punish him; but the one during the dispute was public — Scripture, therefore, did not spare him. R’ Shimon said, Heaven forbid! Such a thought never occurred to that righteous man. Someone of whom it is written, “In all My houshold he is [most] faithful” would say, ‘The Omnipresent cannot satisfy us’? Rather, this is what he said: Six hundred thousand on foot, etc., and You said, ‘I will give them meat for a month,’ and then you will kill a nation as great as this? Will sheep and cattle be slaughered for them so that they should be killed, and this meal will [thus] satisfy them forever? Does this bring you praise, telling a donkey, ‘Eat a ton of barley and then we will chop your head off’? The Holy One, Blessed is He, answered him: But if I do not give it to them, they will say My power [lit. hand] is limited. Is it favorable, in your eyes, that God’s power be limited in their eyes? Let them, and a hundred like them, perish, but My power cannot seem limited to them even for a moment. @p123@p2<EN>Now you will see if My words will occur.@p3 Raban Gamliel, son of R’ Yehudah Hanasi said: (Moshe said:) “It is impossible to maintain one’s position @rr°@bbin [such] a dispute. Since they only seek a pretext, You cannot satisfy them, in the end they will judge You critically. If You give them beef, they will say ‘we wanted mutton,’ if You give them mutton, they will say ‘we wanted beef, we wanted wild game or fowl, we wanted fish or locusts.’ He (God) said to him: ‘If so, they will say My power is limited.’ He (Moshe) said before Him: ‘Here, I will go and appease them.’ He (God) said: ‘Now you will see if My word occurs — they will not listen to you.’ Moshe went to appease them. He said to them: ‘Is God’s power limited? Behold, He struck the rock and water flowed, etc., then He can also provide bread.’ They said: @rr°@bb‘This is a compromise — He does not have the power to fulfill our request.”’ This is what is meant when it says, “Moshe went out and spoke to the people.” When they didn’t listen to him — “He gathered seventy men, etc.” @p125@p2<EN>And did not cease.@p3 They did not prophesy, except for that day alone — this is clearly stated by Sifri. But Onkelos renders “and did not cease” — prophesy did not cease from them. @p126@p2<EN>Two people remained.@p3 Of those chosen. They said, ‘We are not worthy of such greatness.’ @d1They were among those inscribed.@d2 Among those chosen for the Sanhedrin. They were all inscribed specifically by names, and by drawing lots. Since the appropriate amount for twelve tribes was six for each tribe, except for two tribes, each of whom received only five, Moshe said: No tribe will listen to me to subtract one elder from its tribe. What did he do? He took seventy two notes, wrote “elder” on seventy @rr°@bband left two blank. He then chose six from each tribe, totaling seventy two. He told them, ‘Take your notes from the container.’ Whoever chose “elder” was sanctified; to those who chose the empty ones, he said, “The Omnipresent does not want you.” @p127@p2<EN>The youth ran.@p3 @rr°@bbSome say this was Gershom, the son of Moshe. @p128@p2<EN>Destroy them.@p3 Burden them with communal responsibility, @rr°@bband they will destroy themselves. Another interpretation: Detain them @rr°@bbin prison, because they prophesied that Moshe would die and Yehoshua would bring the Israelites into the land. @p129@p2<EN>Are you vengeful for me?@p3 Are you my avenger? Do you take my vengeance for me? @hh<HEB>לִי@ee<ENG> meaning the same as @hh<HEB>בִּשְׁבִילִי@ee<ENG>, “for my sake.” @hh<HEB>קִנְאָה@ee<ENG> always denotes a person who takes something to heart, whether to avenge or to assist. “@ITenprenment@it” in Old French, @rr°@bbone who grasps the bulk of the burden. @p130@p2<EN>Moshe entered@p3 @rr°@bbFrom the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. @d1Into the camp.@d2 @rr°@bbEveryone entered his [own] tent. @d1Entered.@d2 The connotation is to enter a house, as in, “Bring it into your house.” The source for this general connotation is, “He gathers, but does not know who will bring it in.” This teaches that he did not visit punishment upon them until each of the righteous had entered his tent. @p131@p2<EN>And He caused to fly.@p3 Caused to fly. Similarly, “for it flies by quickly,” Also, “they flew by and passed through.” @d1And spread them.@d2 It spread, as in, “Behold, they are spread over the face of all the land,” “I will spread you into the wilderness.” @d1About two @BIamos.@it@d2 They flew to a height which @rr°@bbcorresponded with a person’s heart, so that it would not be tedious to gather them, @rr°@bbneither to rise nor to bend.<QC>
@p132@p2<EN>He who gathered the least.@p3 The one who gathered least of all — the lazy and the lame — @BOgathered ten heaps. @d1They spread them.@d2 They spread them into numerous piles. @p133@p2<EN>Before it was finished.@p3 As Targum [Onkelos] renders, @hh<HEB>עַד לָא פְסַק@ee<ENG>, @rr°@bb(before it was finished). Another interpretation: There was no opportunity to cut it with his teeth, when he expired. @p11@p2<EN>[Miriam] spoke.@p3 @hh<HEB>דִּבּוּר@ee<ENG> always connotes harshness, as it says, “The man who rules the land spoke harshly with us.” But @hh<HEB>אֲמִירָה@ee<ENG> always connotes pleading, as it says, “He said, please, my brothers, do not be wicked,” “He said, please hear my words.” @hh<HEB>נָא@ee<ENG> always connotes a request. @d1Miriam and Aharon spoke.@d2 She opened the discussion first, so Scripture gives her precedence. @rr°@bbHow did Miriam know that Moshe separated from his wife? R’ Noson says: Miriam was at Tziporah’s side when Moshe was told that Eldad and Meidad were prophesying in the camp. When Tziporah heard, she said, ‘Woe to their wives if they become attached to prophecy, because they will separate from their wives the way my husband separated from me.’ Miriam knew from there, and she told Aharon. Now if Miriam, who did not intend to slander him, was punished this way, certainly someone who relates slander about his fellow. @d1The Cushite woman.@d2 This teaches that everyone agreed to her beauty, @rr°@bbjust as everyone agrees to the blackness of the Cushite. @d1Cushite.@d2 [@hh<HEB>כּוּשִׁית@ee<ENG> is] numerically equivalent to @hh<HEB>יְפַת מַרְאֶה @ee<ENG>, (“beautiful in appearance.”) @d1Concerning the woman.@d2 @rr°@bbConcerning her divorce. @d1For, he married a Cushite woman.@d2 What does the Torah teach? You find a woman beautiful in appearance but not beautiful in deed; in deed, but not in appearance. But this one was beautiful in everything. @d1The Cushite woman.@d2 Because of her beauty, she was called “Cushite,” like a man who calls his attractive son “Cushite” to ward off the power of the evil eye over him. @d1For, he married a Cushite woman.@d2 And now divorced her. @p12@p2<EN>Is it only.@p3 @rr°@bbWith him alone that God spoke. @d1Did He not also [speak] with us.@d2 Yet we did not abstain from marital relations. @p13@p2<EN>Humble.@p3 Bent low and forbearing. @p14@p2<EN>Suddenly.@d2 He revealed Himself to them @rr°@bbsuddenly, when they were ritually unclean because of marital relations, and they cried, @rr°@bb”Water! Water!” To inform them that Moshe acted properly in separating from his wife, since the Divine Presence revealed Itself to him constantly, with no designated time for the Word. @d1Come out, all three of you.@d2 This teaches that all three were summoned with a single word, which is impossible for the mouth to say and the ear to hear.<QC>
@p15@p2<EN>In a pillar of cloud.@p3 @rr°@bbHe went alone, unlike the custom of mortals. When a mortal king goes to war, he goes out with a large retinue, when he goes in peace, he goes with only a few. But the custom of the Holy One, Blessed is He, is to go to war alone, as it is said, “[God is] a warrior,” and goes in peace with a large retinue, as is said, “God rides with twenty two thousand angels.” @d1He called [to] Aharon and Miriam.@d2 @rr°@bbSo that they would be drawn away and leave the courtyard towards the Word. @d1Both of them went out.@d2 Why did He draw them away and separate them from Moshe? Because we recite some of a person’s qualities in his presence, and all of them when he is not present. We find this about Noach. When he was not present it is said, “A righteous man, flawless,” but in his presence it is said, “For I have seen that you are righteous before Me.” Another interpretation: So that he should not hear Aharon’s rebuke. @p16@p2<EN>Please listen to my words.@p3 @rr°@bb@hh<HEB>נָא@ee<ENG> is interpreted strictly as a request. @d1If there will be your prophet.@d2 If @rr°@bbyou will have prophets. @d1[I,] Adonoy will make Myself known to him in a vision.@d2 @rr°@bbThe Divine Presence of My Name will not be revealed to him in the illuminated reflection, but in a dream and vision.<QC>
@p18@p2<EN>Mouth to mouth.@p3 @rr°@bbI told him to separate from his wife. Where did I tell him? At Sinai, “Go tell them ‘Return to your tents,’ but you remain with Me here.” @d1In a vision, and not in riddles.@d2 “In a vision” — this is the vision of the word, for I explain My word to him in the clearest form, I do not conceal it in riddles the way it was said to Yechezkel, “Present a riddle, etc.” Perhaps [this refers to] the vision of the Divine Presence? The Torah teaches, “you cannot see My Presence.” @d1He gazes at the likeness of Adonoy.@d2 This is the vision of the back, according to what is said, “But you may see what is behind Me.”<QC>
@d1About My servant, about Moshe.@d2 It does not say, ‘about My servant Moshe,’ but ‘about My servant, about Moshe’ — about My servant, even if he were not Moshe, about Moshe, even if he were not My servant, It would have been appropriate for you to have been in awe of him. Certainly since he is My servant, and the king’s servant is [as] the king. You should have said, ‘The king does not love him gratuitously.’ And if you say that @rr°@bbI am not aware of his actions, then this (statement) is worse than the first! @p19@p2<EN>Adonoy’s anger flared against them and He left.@p3 After He informed them of their reprehensible behavior, He decreed excommunication against them. Certainly a mortal, then, should not be angry with his fellow until he informs him of his reprehensible behavior. @p110@p2<EN>The cloud departed.@p3 Afterward, “Behold, Miriam was leprous, like snow.” This is compared to a king who said to a pedagogue, ‘Punish my son, but do not punish him until I leave, as I pity him.’ @p111@p2<EN>We have foolishly done.@p3 As Targum [Onkelos] translates, from the word @hh<HEB>אֱוִיל@ee<ENG>, “fool.” @p112@p2<EN>Please, let her not be,@p3 this our sister. @d1Like the dead.@d2 Since the leper is considered dead. @rr°@bbJust as the dead cause ritual defilement when entering [a room], so does the leper cause ritual defilement when entering. @d1That, since he came from his mother’s womb.@d2 “@ITOur@it mother” should have been said, but Scripture euphemises. Similarly, “half his flesh” — “half @ITour@it flesh” should have been said, but Scripture euphemises. That, since she came from our mother’s womb, [what] she [suffers] is ours, as if half our flesh were eaten away. This is similar to what is said, “for he is our brother, our flesh.” The simple interpretation also appears the same. @rr°@bbIt is unconscionable for a brother to allow his sister to remain as if dead. @d1That, since he came.@d2 Since he [also] came from the mother’s womb of this one who has the power to help but does not, then half his own flesh is eaten away, as his brother, is his flesh. Another interpretation [of] “Please, let her not be like the dead.” If you do not heal her through prayer, @rr°@bbwho will confine her, and who will purify her? I can not possibly examine her, as I am related, and a relative cannot examine the symptoms of leprosy. And there is no other @ITkohein@it in the world. This is [what is meant by] “that, since he came from his mother’s womb.” @p113@p2<EN>Please, God, please heal her.@p3 Scripture comes to teach proper behavior — that one who requests something from his fellow must say two or three words of supplication, then, afterward, make his requests. @d1Saying.@d2 What does the Torah teach? He (Moshe) said to Him, @rr°@bb‘Answer me, [as to] whether or not You will cure her’ — until He did answer, “If her father were to spit, etc.” R’ Elazar son of Azariah said, in four places, Moshe asked the Holy One, Blessed is He, that He answer him [as to] whether or not He would grant his requests. Similarly, “Moshe spoke before God, saying, etc.” What does the Torah teach by writing “saying”? ‘Answer me [as to] whether or not You will redeem them’ — until He did answer him, “Now you will see, etc.” Similarly, “Moshe spoke to God, saying, ‘let God, the God of the spirit of all flesh, appoint’.” He answered: “Take for you.” Similarly, “I pleaded with God at that time, saying.” He answered him, “Enough, for you.” @d1Please heal her.@d2 Why did not Moshe pray at length? So that the Israelites should not say, “His sister is suffering, and he stands and prolongs his prayer.” (Another interpretation: So that the Israelites should not say, For his sister he prays at length, but for us he does not pray at length). @p114@p2<EN>If (lit. “and”) her father were to spit in her face.@p3 @rr°@bbIf her father were to display, to her, an angry face, would she not be humiliated for seven days? @rr°@bbCertainly, then, in the case of the Divine Presence, [she should be humiliated] for fourteen days. However, it is sufficient that the derivative equal the source of its derivation. Therefore, even with My rebuke, let her be confined for seven days. @d1And after that, she may join again.@d2 I say that all @hh<HEB>אֲסִיפוֹת@ee<ENG> mentioned regarding lepers are related to his expulsion from the camp. When he is cured, he is brought into the camp. Thus, @hh<HEB>אֲסִיפָה@ee<ENG> is written concerning him, meaning bringing in.<QC>
@p115@p2<EN>The people did not depart.@p3 This honor was accorded her by the Omnipresent for @rr°@bbthe one hour she remained with Moshe when he was cast into the river, as it is said, “his sister stood from afar, etc.<QC>
@p12@p2<EN>Send, for yourself.@p3 @rr°@bbWhy is the chapter of the spies adjacent to the chapter of Miriam? Because she was punished over the matter of her slanderous conversation about her brother, and those wicked men saw, but did not accept reproof. @d1Send, for yourself.@d2 @rr°@bbAccording to your opinion I do not command you. If you wish, send. Because the Israelites came and said, ‘let us send men before us,’ as it is said, “all of you approached me, etc.” @rr°@bbMoshe conferred with the @ITShechinah.@it He (Hashem) said, ‘I told them that it is good, as it is said, “I will bring you up from the suffering of Egypt, etc.” By their lives!

@d1All of them [were] men of distinction.@d2 @hh<HEB>אֲנָשִׁים@ee<ENG> in Scripture always @rr°@bbrefers to distinction. @rr°@bbAt that time they were righteous. @p116@p2<EN>Moshe called Hosheiah, etc.@p3 He prayed for him, @rr°@bb‘may Hashem save you from [joining] the counsel of the spies.”<QC>

From there, they turned and proceeded along the entire western border by the seashore, until the entrance of Chamas, which is near Hor Hahar, at the northwestern corner, as the boundaries of the land are explicitly stated in the portion of “These are the journeys.” @p122@p2<EN>And [he] came to Chevron:@p3 Caleiv went there alone and prostrated himself [in prayer] @rr°@bbat the grave of the patriarchs, so that he would not be enticed by his companions to join in their design. Accordingly, it says, “I will give him (Caleiv) the land on which he walked,” and it is written, “they gave to Caleiv, Chevron.” @d1Was built seven years.@d2 Is it possible that Cham built Chevron, for his youngest son Canaan, before he built Tzo’an, for his eldest son Mitzrayim? Rather, it was @rr°@bbbuilt up with everything good, seven times more than Tzoan. @rr°@bbThis informs you of the praiseworthiness of Eretz Yisroel, for nothing in Eretz Yisroel is more @rr°@bbbarren than Chevron that is why it was set aside as a cemetery. Nothing is as excellent, among all the countries, as Mitzrayim, as it is said, “Like Hashem’s garden, like the land of Mitzrayim.” And Tzoan was the most excellent in the land of Mitzrayim, for the seat of royalty was there, as it is said, “for his ministers were in Tzoan.” Yet, Chevron was seven times better. @p123@p2<EN>A branch.@p3 A branch of the grapevine @rr°@bbwith a cluster of grapes hanging from it. @d1They carried it between two on a pole.@d2 From the plain meaning of the statement “they carried it on a pole,” @rr°@bbdo I not know that it was with two [carriers]? What does the Torah teach by saying “between two”? With two poles. How was this? @rr°@bbEight took the cluster, one took the fig, one the pomegranate. Yehoshuah and Caleiv did not take anything, since the sole purpose of the others was to deliver a slanderous report — ‘Just as its fruit is strange, so are its people strange.’ If you want to know how much one of them weighed, go and learn from the stones they set up in Gilgal.

When they hear that You killed them, they will not say that they sinned against You.

@p114@p2<EN>They will say, concerning (lit. to) the inhabitants of this land.@p3 Like @hh<HEB>עַל@ee<ENG>, “concerning” the inhabitants of this land.  What will they say about them?

When Moshe ascended on high, he found the Holy One, Blessed is He, sitting and writing, “Hashem is slow to anger.” He (Moshe) said to Him, ‘to the righteous’? The Holy One, Blessed is He, said to him, ‘even to the wicked’! He (Moshe) said to Him, ‘let the wicked perish’! He said to him ‘by your life, you will need this thing.’ When the Israelites sinned with the [golden] calf and the spies, Moshe prayed before Him with “slow to anger.” The Holy One, Blessed is He, said: “But you said to Me ‘to the righteous”’? He (Moshe) said to Him: “But You said to me, ‘Even to the wicked’.” @d1Acquit.@p3 Those who repent. @d1[He] does not acquit.@d2 @rr°@bbThose who do not repent. @p120@p2<EN>As you spoke.@p3 Because of your statement, @rr°@bb”lest they say, ‘because of Hashem’s inability’.” @p121@p2<EN>However.@p3 Like, ‘However, I will do the following to them.’<QC>

To the spies he said, ‘I am with you in your plan,’ but in his heart he intended to tell the truth. Because of this, he was able to silence them, as it is said, “Caleiv silenced [the people],” since they thought he would speak as they did. Thus it is said in the book of Yehoshua, “I (Caleiv) brought back word to him (Moshe) @rr°@bbaccording to what was in my heart — but not according to what was in my mouth. @d1And followed Me fully.@d2 @rr°@bbHe followed Me full-heartedly. This is a shortened passage. @d1To which he came.@d2 @rr°@bbChevron will be given to m. @d1Will cast out [the inhabitants] from it.@d2 As Targum [Onkelos] renders it, “they will cast out from it.” They will cast out the giants and the people who are in it.

@p128@p2<EN>As I live.@p3 This denotes an oath. ‘If [I do] not, etc., so I shall do, @rr°@bbif it were possible to say, I do not live. @d1As you have spoken.@d2 You requested from Me, “Or would that we had died in this desert.” @p129@p2<EN>All of you who were counted according to your numbers.@p3 All those counted in every census in which you were counted.

@p132@p2<EN>Your corpses — yours.@p3 As Targum [Onkelos] renders [(@hh<HEB>דִי לְכוֹן@ee<ENG>) “yours”]. Since He discussed @rr°@bbbringing the children into the land, and He now wants to say ‘but you will die,’ it is appropriate, here, to say “yours.”<QC>
@p133@p2<EN>Forty years.@p3 Not one of them died @rr°@bbbefore the age of sixty. This is why the decree was for forty [years], so that those who were twenty years old would reach the age of sixty. @rr°@bbThe first year was included, although it preceded the sending of the spies, because, from the time that they made the golden calf, the plan for this decree was formulated, But He waited until their measure was filled. This is [the meaning of] what is said, “on my day of reckoning — with the spies — I will take their sin into account.” Here, too, it is said, “you must bear your sins,” [plural] two sins, that of the calf, and that of the complaint. In calculating their ages, He considered @rr°@bbpart of the year as the whole, so that when they entered their sixtieth year, those who had been twenty years old died. @d1They will bear [the burden of] your dissoluteness.@d2 As Targum [Onkelos] renders, “they will receive [punishment for] your sins.” @p134@p2<EN>My displeasure.@p3 @rr°@bbYou diverted your hearts from following Me. @hh<HEB>תְּנוּאָה@ee<ENG> denotes turning away, like, “for her father restrained her [from her vow].” @p136@p2<EN>Who returned and provoked [the] complaints against him.@p3 When they returned from spying on the land, they incited the entire congregation against him by issuing a derogatory report — those men died. @hh<HEB>הוֹצָאַת דִּבָּה@ee<ENG> always denotes directed speech, where the tongue is plied to report about someone, like, “causing the lips of sleepers to murmur.” It may be either good or bad. This is why it says here “who spread evil slander against the land,” since @hh<HEB>דִּבָּה@ee<ENG> may be good.<QC>
@d1Slander.@d2 @ITParlerie@it in Old French. @p137@p2<EN>In a plague, before Adonoy.@p3 By the particular death suited to them, measure for measure.

This is why it says, @hh<HEB>בַּמַּגֵּפָה@ee<ENG>, and not @hh<HEB>בְּמַּגֵּפָה @ee<ENG>. And this is [the meaning of] “before Hashem” — as particularly suited to them, according to the attributes of the Holy One, Blessed is He, Who metes out measure for measure. @p138@p2<EN>Yehoshua .<TIE>.<TIE>. and Caleiv .<TIE>.<TIE>. lived, etc.@p3 @rr°@bbWhat does the Torah teach by saying, “lived, from among those men”? It teaches that they took the spies’ portion in the land, replacing them in life.<QC>

@p144@p2<EN>They defiantly.@p3 The word [@hh<HEB>וַיַעְפִּלוּ@ee<ENG>] denotes strength. Similarly, “behold, [the wicked] are towering.” @ITEngres,@it in Old French, denoting willfulness. Similarly, “the fortress of the daughter of Zion,” “fortress and stronghold.” But Midrash Tanchuma explains it as denoting darkness — they went in darkness, without permission. @p145@p2<EN>And crushed them.@p3 Like, “I crushed it, grinding it [well].” Blow after blow. @d1Until Chormah.@d2 The place was named @rr°@bbto commemorate this incident. @p12@p2<EN>(When you arrive.@p3 He informed them that they would enter the land.) @p13@p2<EN>When you make a fire-offering.@p3 @rr°@bbThis does not denote a command.

The meal-<FJ> offering is to be completely consumed, @rr°@bbwith the oil absorbed in it, @rr°@bband the wine [is poured] into the bowls, as we learned in @ITMaseches@it Sukkah. @p15@p2<EN>For the one sheep.@p3 This relates to everything stated above — the meal-<FJ> offering, the oil, and the wine. @p16@p2<EN>If (lit. or) for a ram.@p3 @rr°@bbIf it is a ram. The Rabbis extrapolate, ‘@hh<HEB>אוֹ@ee<ENG>’ includes @rr°@bbthe “@ITpalgas@it” in the libations of the ram.<QC>
@p110@p2<EN>A fire-offering [of pleasing] fragrance.@p3 This refers only to the meal-offering and the oil, but the wine is not a fire-offering, as it is not placed on the fire. @p111@p2<EN>Or for the sheep, etc.@p3 Whether of sheep or of goats. @hh<HEB>כֶּבֶשׂ@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>שֶׂה@ee<ENG> are so entitled during their first year; @hh<HEB>אַיִל@ee<ENG> from the age of thirteen months and one day. @p112@p2<EN>According to the number which you offer.@p3 @rr°@bbAccording to the number of animals which you offer as sacrifices, so shall you make the libations for each of them. According to the number of animals, the number of libations.<QC>
@p115@p2<EN>Just as it is for yourselves, so shall it be for the proselyte.@p3 Like you, so is the proselyte. This is the Hebrew style, “Like Hashem”’s garden, like the land of Egypt” — so is the land of Egypt. @rr°@bb”Like me, like you, like my people, like your people.”<QC>
@p118@p2<EN>At your coming to the land.@p3 This “coming” is different from all the “comings” in the Torah. With all of them it says, “when you come,” “when all of you come.” Therefore, all are learned from each other. Since Scripture specified with one of them that it is only after inheriting and settling, all of them are the same. But with this, it is said, “at your coming.” As soon as they entered it (the land) and ate its bread, they were obligated with the mitzvah of @ITchallah.<QC>
@p120@p2<EN>[From] the first portion of your doughs.@p3 When you knead the amount of dough that you generally knead in the desert — how much is that? “They measured it with an @ITomer,@it” “An @ITomer@it per person” (the amount is forty-three and one-fifth eggs) — you shall separate [the @ITterumah@it-gift] from its first portion. As if to say, ‘before you eat the first portion from it, separate one loaf as a @ITterumah@it-gift for the sake of Hashem”.’ @d1A loaf.@d2 @ITTortel@it in Old French. @d1Like the @ITterumah@it-gift of the granary.@d2 @rr°@bbFor which no specific amount is required, but not like like the @ITterumah@it-offering from the tithe, @rr°@bbfor which a specific amount is required. However, the sages required a specific amount: For the home maker, one twenty-fourth, for the commercial baker, one forty-eighth. @p121@p2<EN>Of the first portion of your doughs.@p3 Why is this said? Because it says, “The first portion of your dough,” I would understand this as @rr°@bbthe first of the loaves. The Torah therefore teaches, “of the first portion” — part of it, but not all of it. @d1You shall give to Adonoy, as a @BIterumah@BO-<FJ> offering.@d2 As we have not heard of a specific amount for the @ITchallah@it-offering, it says, “you shall give” — it should consist of @rr°@bban amount sufficient for “giving.” @p122@p2<EN>If you should err and not fulfill.@p3 this refers to idol worship. which was categorized within all the commandments for which the community brings an ox, but Scripture here removes it from the category, @rr°@bbto indicate that it requires an ox as a burnt-offering, and a goat as a sin-offering. @d1If you err, etc.@d2 Scripture speaks here of idol worship. But perhaps it refers to one of all the [other] commandments? The Torah therefore teaches, “all of these commandments” — @rr°@bba single commandment which is equivalent to all the commandments. Just as someone who transgresses all the commandments casts off the yoke, breaks the covenant, and brazenly defies [the Torah], so with [someone who transgresses] this commandment, he casts off the yoke, breaks the covenant, @rr°@bband brazenly defies [the Torah]. Which is this? Idol worship. @d1Which Adonoy said to Moshe.@d2 “I am .<TIE>.<TIE>.,” and “you must not have .<TIE>.<TIE>.” @rr°@bbwe heard from the mouth of the Omnipotent, as it is written, “Hashem” spoke once, but I heard two.” @p123@p2<EN>All that [Adonoy] commanded.@p3 This teaches that if one admits to idolatry, it is as if he had denied the entire Torah, and all that the prophets prophesied, as it is said, “from the day that Hashem” commanded and onward.” @p124@p2<EN>If, it was obscured from the eyes of the congregation, having been done in error.@d2 If, because of the seers of the community, this transgression was committed through error. [For example,] they erred, @rr°@bband ruled that one of the forms of service is permitted for idol worship. @d1@hh<HEB>לְחַטָּת@ee<ENG>, as a sin-offering.@d2 The ‘@hh<HEB>א@ee<ENG>’ is missing, because this is not like the other sin-offerings. All of the sin-offerings in the Torah which are brought with an @ITolah@it-offering, the sin-offering precedes the @ITolah,@it as it is said, “he shall make the second one an @ITolah.@it”  But with this, the @ITolah@it precedes the sin-offering.<QC>
@p125@p2<EN>They have brought their offering as a fire-offering to Adonoy.@p3 This refers to that which is stated in our @ITparshah,@it namely @rr°@bbthe ox as the @ITolah@it-offering, as it is said, “a fire-offering to Adonoy.” @d1And their sin-offering.@d2 This refers to the goat.<QC>
@p127@p2<EN>Will sin erroneously.@p3 @rr°@bbThrough idolatry. @d1A yearling she-goat.@d2 For other transgressions, the individual brings a sheep or goat, @rr°@bbbut for this, a goat is designated. @p130@p2<EN>High handedly.@p3 Intentionally. @d1Blasphemes.@d2 Reviles, like, “despised and reviled,” “which the servants of the king of Ashur reviled.” @rr°@bbIn addition, the Rabbis derive from here that someone who curses Hashem” is subject to “@ITkoreis@it.” @p131@p2<EN>The word of Adonoy.@p3 The prohibition against idol worship was @rr°@bbby the word of the Omnipotent, the rest by the word of Moshe.<QC>
@d1Its iniquity is upon it.@d2 @rr°@bbDuring the time his sin is within him — if he has not repented. @p132@p2<EN>[Bnei Yisroel] were in the desert and they found.@p3 Scripture speaks disparagingly of the Israelites. @rr°@bbThey kept only the first Shabbos, then this person came and desecrated the second.<QC>
@p133@p2<EN>Those who found him gathering.@p3 @rr°@bbThey warned him, but he did not desist from gathering, even after they found and warned him. @p134@p2<EN>Since it was not specified, what was to be done with him.@p3 [They did not know] @rr°@bbhow to execute him, but they knew that someone who desecrates the Shabbos must be put to death. @p135@p2<EN>Shall stone.@p3 Constantly do. @ITFisant@it in Old French. Similarly, @hh<HEB>הָלוֹךְ@ee<ENG>, @IT alant.@it @rr°@bbSimilarly, “constantly remember,” and “constantly keep.” @p136@p2<EN>Brought him outside.@p3 From here [we derive] that the stoning platform was outside, far from the courthouse. @p138@p2<EN>To make for themselves, @ITtzitzis@it-fringes.@p3 @rr°@bbSo named because of the fringes hanging from it, like, “He took me by the fringes of my head.” Another interpretation: “@ITtzizis@it” because of “when you see it,” like “watching from the openings.” @d1Blue [wool].@d2 The blue dye @rr°@bbof the @ITchilazon@it-fish. @p139@p2<EN>You will remember all of Adonoy’s commandments.@p3 As @rr°@bbthe numerical value of @hh<HEB>צִיצִית@ee<ENG> is 600, @rr°@bband the eight threads and five knots equal 613. @d1And you will not search after [the desire of] your hearts.@d2 This is similar to “from spying the land.” The heart and eye are the body’s spies, bringing it sins. The eye sees, the heart lusts, and the body sins. @p141@p2<EN>I am Adonoy.@p3 Faithful in rewarding.<QC>
@d1Your God.@d2 @rr°@bbFaithful in exacting punishment. @d1Who brought you out.@d2 I redeemed you @rr°@bbon condition that you accept my decrees. @d1I am Adonoy your God.@d2 Why is this said again? So that the Israelites should not say: “Why did the Omnipresent command? Was it not so that we should perform [the commandments] and be rewarded? Let us not perform, and not be rewarded”! Even against your will, I am your king. Similarly, it says, “[As I live .<TIE>.<TIE>. ] if I shall not, with a mighty hand .<TIE>.<TIE>. rule over you.” @rr°@bbAnother interpretation. Why is the exodus from Egypt mentioned? It was I who distinguished, in Egypt, between the [reproductive] drop which was the firstborn, and that which was not the firstborn. It is I who will distinguish, and punish those who attach [fringes dyed with] @rr°@bbindigo dye on their garments, and claim that it is the “@ITtecheiles@it” dye. From R’ Moshe Hadarshan’s commentary I transcribed: Why is the chapter of the “gatherer” adjacent to the chapter of idolatry? To teach that the Shabbos desecrator is like an idolator, since it (Shabbos), too, is equated with the entire Torah. This is stated in Ezra: “You descended on mount Sinai and gave Your nation the Torah and the commandments, etc., and You made Your sacred Shabbos known to them.” The portion of @ITtzitzis,@it also for this reason, is adjacent to these [portions] — since it, too, is equivalent to all the commandments, as it is said, “you will perform all the commandments.” @d1On the corners of their garments.@d2 This corresponds with, “I carried you on the wings of eagles.” On the four corners — @rr°@bbbut not on a garment with three, or with five [corners]. This corresponds with the four expressions of redemption which were stated in Egypt — “I will bring [you] out,” “I will save [you],” “I will redeem [you],” “I will take [you].” @d1A thread of blue.@d2 [@hh<HEB>תְּכֵלֶת@ee<ENG>] so named because of the [Egyptians’] loss of their firstborn. The targum — translation of @hh<HEB>שִׁכּוּל@ee<ENG>, “loss of a child,” is @hh<HEB>תִּכְלָא@ee<ENG>. And they were struck down at night. The color of “@IT techeiles@it” is similar to the sky which darkens during evening. Its eight threads @rr°@bbcorrespond with the eight days the Israelites waited, from the time they left Egypt, until they sang at the [Reed] Sea.<QC>
@p11@p2<EN>Korach took.@p3 @rr°@bbThis passage is beautifully expounded by Midrash R’ Tanchuma. @d1Korach took.@d2 He took himself to a different side, to be @rr°@bbdisassociated from the community and to cast aspersion on the @ITkehunah@it. This is why Onkelos translates @hh<HEB>וְאִתְפְּלֵג@ee<ENG>, he separated himself from the rest of the community in order to maintain the dispute. Similarly, “why does your heart take you?”— (i.e.,) it takes you to separate you from other people. @rr°@bbAnother interpretation [of] “Korach took”: He won over the heads of the Sanhedrin among them, with flattering words, as it is said, “take Aharon,” “take words with you.”<QC>
@d1The son of Yitzhar, the son of Kehos, the son of Levi.@d2 But @rr°@bbScripture does not mention, “the son of Yaakov,” since he [Yaakov] implored [God] for compassion on himself that his name be omitted from their dispute, as it is said, “let my honor not be identified with their assembly.” @rr°@bbWhere is his (Yaakov’s) name mentioned with Korach? At the genealogical identification [of the Levites] at the platform, in Divrei Hayamim, as it is said, “the son of Evyasaf, the son of Korach, the son of Yitzhar, the son of Kehos, the son of Levi, the son of Yisroel.” @d1And Dasan and Aviram.@d2 Because the tribe of Reuven made their camp at the south, @rr°@bbneighboring Kehos and his sons, who camped at the south, they joined Korach in his dispute. @rr°@bb”Woe to the wicked, woe to his neighbor”! @rr°@bbWhy did Korach see fit to dispute Moshe? He envied @rr°@bbElitzafan the son of Uziel for his leadership. Moshe appointed him leader over the sons of Kehos, by the word of God. Korach said, ‘Father had four brothers, as it is said: “The sons of Kehos, etc.” Amram was the firstborn. His two sons assumed great distinction — one (Moshe) is the monarch, the other (Aharon) the @ITKohein Gadol@it. Who should appropriately assume the second [position], if not I, the son of Yitzhar, second to Amram? Yet he appointed, as leader, the son of the youngest of all of his (Amram’s) brothers. I will oppose him, and nullify everything he said.’ What did he do? He rose up and gathered two hundred fifty heads of Sanhedrin, mostly from the neighboring tribe of Reuven — they were Elitzur the son of Shdeiur, and his companions, and the like, as it is said, “leaders of the congregation, who were called to meetings,” and it says above, @rr°@bb”those called from the congregation (leaders of their ancestral tribes).” He clothed them in @rr°@bbgarments made completely of @ITtecheiles.@it They came and stood before Moshe and said to him: “Does a garment made completely of @ITtecheiles@it require @ITtzitzis,@it or not?’ He said to them: “It is required.” They began scoffing at him. “How is it possible that a garment made of other material is absolved by a single thread of @ITtecheiles,@it yet one made completely of @ITtecheiles@it cannot absolve itself?” @d1The sons of Reuvein.@d2 @rr°@bbDasan and Aviram, and On the son of Peles. @p13@p2<EN>You have [taken] too much for yourselves.@p3 @rr°@bbYou have taken much more distinction for yourselves [than is appropriate]. @d1Are all holy.@d2 @rr°@bbThey all heard the Word, at Sinai, from the mouth of the Almighty.<QC>
@d1Why do you raise yourselves.@d2 @rr°@bbIf you took the monarchy, you should not have chosen the @ITkehunah@it for your brother. @rr°@bbYou were not alone in hearing, at Sinai, “I am God your God”— the entire community heard. @p14@p2<EN>He fell upon his face.@p3 @rr°@bbBecause of the dispute, as this was, already, @rr°@bbtheir fourth despicable act. They sinned with the golden calf — “Moshe implored .<TIE>.<TIE>. “ With the complainers — “Moshe prayed .<TIE>.<TIE>.” With the spies — “Moshe said to God, If Egypt should hear.<TIE>.<TIE>.” At Korach’s dispute, his hands were weakened. This is compared to a prince who acted despicably against his father. His intimate friend placated him the first, second, and third times, but at the fourth despicable act, the friend’s hands were weakened. He said: “How long can I impose upon the king? Perhaps he will no longer receive me.” @p15@p2<EN>[In the] morning, [Adonoy] will make known.@p3 @rr°@bbThis is a time when we are intoxicated, and it would be improper [for us] to appear in His Presence. His intention was to delay, so that they might repent.<QC>
@d1[In the] morning, Adonoy will make known who is [qualified to be] His.@d2 @rr°@bbFor the Levite services. @d1And who is holy.@d2 For the @ITkehunah@it. @d1He will bring.@d2 @rr°@bbThem close to Him. Targum [Onkelos] demonstrates this: “He will bring into His presence.” “He will bring into His service.” According to the Midrashic interpretation of “morning”: Moshe said to them, ‘God marked His universe with boundaries. Can you possibly transform morning into evening? that is how possible it is for you to nullify this, as it is said, “it became evening and it became morning, and He separated” Similarly, “Aharon was separated to be consecrated etc.” @p16@p2<EN>Do this: Take, for yourselves, fire pans.@p3 Why did he see fit to tell them this? He said to them, “the gentile way is to have a variety of rituals, with many priests, [not all] gathered in one Temple. We have only one God, one Ark, one Torah, one Altar, and one @ITKohein Gadol@it. Yet you — two hundred and fifty men — seek the @ITkehunah Gedolah@it! I, too, will acquiesce. Here you have the most precious service, the incense, more precious than all the sacrifices. But a deadly poison is placed in it, which consumed Nadav and Avihu.” He, therefore, warned them, “The man who will be chosen by Adonoy, he is the holy one.” He was already holy. Do we not know that the chosen one is holy? Rather, Moshe said to them, “I tell you this so that you will not be found guilty. The chosen one will survive, but all of you will be lost.” @d1Fire pans.@d2 Utensils for stoking coals, with a handle.<QC>
@p17@p2<EN>You have taken [too] much upon yourselves, sons of Levi.@p3 [I told you many things which are acceptable to the heart (i.e., reasonable). Another interpretation:] What I have said to you is a matter of great significance. Were they not fools, for he warned them, and yet they undertook to bring the offering? They sinned with their souls, as it is said, “the firepans of these sinners with their souls.” @rr°@bbBut Korach who was astute, why did he see fit to engage in this foolishness? His vision deceived him. He saw a great dynasty descending from him — Shmuel, who was equal to Moshe and Aharon. He said, “for his sake, I will be spared.” And twenty four watches arising from his descendants, all prophesying by Divine inspiration, as it is said, “all of these were the sons of Heiman.” He said, “is it possible that all this greatness is destined to arise from me, and I shall remain silent”? This is why he participated, for, he had heard from Moshe’s mouth, that they would all be lost, but one would be spared: “The one whom God will choose, he is holy.” He mistakenly attributed this to himself, but his vision was flawed, as his sons repented. But Moshe saw. @d1Too much upon yourselves@d2 @rr°@bbYou have undertaken a great task for yourselves to dispute the Holy One, Blessed is He.<QC>
@p18@p2<EN>Moshe said to Korach, “Please listen, sons of Levi.”@p3 He began speaking gently to him, but when he saw that he was stiff necked, he said, “before the other tribes join and are lost with him, I had better speak with all of them, too.” He began exhorting them, “please listen, sons of Levi.” @p19@p2<EN>And to stand before the congregation.@p3 To sing on the platform. @p110@p2<EN>He brought you near.@p3 @rr°@bbTo the service from which he distanced the rest of the community of Yisroel. @p111@p2<EN>Therefore,@p3 @rr°@bbBecause of this, you, and your entire congregation who are gathered with you, have assembled against God, for I have acted as His representative in awarding the @ITkehunah@it to Aharon. This quarrel is not with us. @p112@p2<EN>Moshe sent, etc.@p3 From here [we derive] that one should not maintain a dispute, for Moshe sought them out in order to come to terms with them through a peaceful dialogue. @d1We will not go up.@d2 Their own words caused them to stumble — they will have nothing but a downfall.<QC>
@p114@p2<EN>And [not] given us.@p3 The statement relates to @hh<HEB>Gא@ee<ENG> (“not”), mentioned above, as if to say, “you have not brought us, and you have not given us an inheritance of fields and vineyards. @rr°@bbYou told us, ‘I will bring you up out of the suffering of Egypt to a good land .<TIE>.<TIE>. [flowing with milk and honey].’ You brought us out of there, but not to a land flowing with milk and honey did you bring us. Rather, you decreed, against us, that we die in the wilderness, as you said to us, ‘Your corpses will fall in this wilderness’.”<QC>
@d1If you put those people’s eyes out, etc.@d2 @rr°@bbEven if you send agents to put our eyes out unless we go up to you, we will not go up. @d1Those people.@d2 Like a man who attributes his own curse to someone else. @p115@p2<EN>Moshe was extremely distressed.@p3 And Moshe was very grieved. @d1Do not turn to their offering.@d2 According to the plain interpretation, [through] @rr°@bbthe incense which they will offer before you tomorrow, do not turn to them. According to the Midrash, he said, “I know @rr°@bbthat they have a portion in the continual communal sacrifices. Let their portion not be received by you favorably. Let the fire allow it to remain without consuming it.” @d1Not a donkey did I sequester from any one of them.@d2 I did not take a donkey from any @rr°@bbone of them. Even when I went from Midyan to Egypt and set my wife and sons on a donkey, when @rr°@bbI could have justifiably taken that donkey from them, I took only of my own. Onkelos translates @hh<HEB>שְׁחָרִית@ee<ENG>, “sequestered.” In Aramaic, the king’s service is called @hh<HEB>שַׁחְוַור@ee<ENG>.<QC>

What is this creation? “The earth will open its mouth and swallow them.” Then, you will know that they angered God, and I spoke according to the word of the Almighty. The Rabbis interpret, @rr°@bb‘if the mouth of the earth was created during the six days of creation, fine, but if not, let God it create [now]!’ @p134@p2<EN>Fled from their uproar.@p3 Because of @rr°@bbthe sound of the earth swallowing them up. @p12@p2<EN>And the fire.@p3 @rr°@bbIn the firepans. @d1Scatter yonder.@d2 To the ground, @rr°@bbfrom the firepans. @d1For, they were sanctified.@d2 @rr°@bbThe firepans, and may not be used for personal benefit, since they designated them as sacred service utensils. @p13@p2<EN>These sinners with their souls.@p3 @rr°@bbThey became willful sinners with their souls by disputing the Holy One, Blessed is He. @d1Hammered.@d2 Beaten. @d1Sheets.@d2 Hammered sheets. @ITTendes,@it “sheets,” in Old French. @d1To overlay the altar.@d2 @rr°@bbThe copper altar. @d1They shall be for a sign.@d2 A reminder, so that they will say, “These belonged to the ones who disputed the @ITkehunah,@it and were burned.” @p14@p2<EN>And hammered them.@p3 @ITAtendirent,@it “hammered” in Old French. @p15@p2<EN>So as not to be like Korach.@p3 @rr°@bbIn order not to be like Korach. @d1As Adonoy spoke to him, through Moshe.@d2 Like @hh<HEB>עָלָיו@ee<ENG>, “about him.” About Aharon, He spoke to Moshe, [saying] that he and his sons shall be @ITkohanim.@it Therefore, a stranger should not approach who is not a descendant of Aharon, etc. Similarly, every @hh<HEB>לִי@ee<ENG>, @hh<HEB>לוֹ@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>לָהֶם@ee<ENG> next to @hh<HEB>דִּבּוּר@ee<ENG>, “speech,” is interpreted as @hh<HEB>עַל@ee<ENG>, “about.” According to Midrash, @rr°@bbabout Korach, what is [the meaning of] @hh<HEB>בְּיַד משֶׁה@ee<ENG>, [literally “in the hand of Moshe,”] [why did] Scripture not write “to Moshe”? This alludes that those who dispute the @ITkehunah@it @rr°@bbare stricken with @ITtzora'as,@it as Moshe was stricken in his hand, as it is said, “when he withdrew it, his hand was stricken with @ITtzora’as@it — white as snow.” This is why Uziyah was stricken with @ITtzora’as.@it<QC>
@p111@p2<EN>And atone for them.@p3 This was the secret, the angel of death conveyed to him when he [Moshe] ascended to heaven, that incense holds back the plague, as stated in @ITMaseches@it Shabbos.<QC>
@p113@p2<EN>He stood between the dead etc.@p3 @rr°@bbHe grasped the angel and held him against his will. The angel said to him, “Permit me to perform my duty.” He said to him, “Moshe ordered me to stop you.” He said to him, “I represent God, while you represent Moshe.” He said to him, “Moshe says nothing of his own volition, only from the mouth of the Almighty. If you don’t believe me — why the Holy One, Blessed is He, and Moshe are at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. Come with me and ask.” This is [the meaning of] what is said — Aharon returned to Moshe. @rr°@bbAnother interpretation: Why with incense? Because the Israelites were grumbling, and vilifying the incense, saying that it was a deadly poison — because of it, Nadav and Avihu died, because of it, two hundred and fifty men were consumed. The Holy One, Blessed is He, said, ‘You will see that it [incense] halts the plague — it is sinfulness, that kills.’<QC>

This is the fruit which blossoms more quickly than all fruits. One who callenges the @ITkehunah@it as well, will be punished quickly, as we find with Uzyah, “the @ITtzora’as@it emanated from his forehead.” Targum [Onkelos] renders, “it clustered almonds” — a sort of almond cluster, bunched together with each other.<QC>

The Torah, therefore, teaches, “for God,” as specified above, to attend to the mandate — custodians and administrators. @p17@p2<EN>The service as a gift.@p3 I have given it to you @rr°@bbas a gift. @p18@p2<EN>Behold, I have given you.@p3 With joy. @rr°@bbThis term denotes joy, as in, “behold, he is going out to meet you, and when he sees you, he will rejoice in his heart.” This is compared to a king who gave a property to his intimate friend, but did not write and sign a deed, or register it with the authorities. Someone came and claimed the property. The king said to him: “Whoever wishes will come and claim against you. Behold, I will write and sign a deed to you, and register it with the authorites.” Here, too, because Korach came and claimed the @ITkehunah@it from Aharon, Scripture @rr°@bbpresents him with twenty-four @ITkehunah@it gifts, with the eternal covenant of salt.

@p112@p2<EN>He shall cleanse himself with it.@p3 @rr°@bbWith [these] ashes [of the cow]. @p113@p2<EN>A corpse of a [human] soul.@p3 Which corpse? That of a human soul. @rr°@bbThis excludes that of an animal, whose ritual uncleanliness does not require sprinkling Another interpretation: “Of a [human] soul” @rr°@bbrefers to a quarter of blood. @d1Defiles the @BIMishkan@BO of Adonoy.@d2 @rr°@bbIf he enters the Mishkan courtyard, even after ritual immersion, without having been sprinkled on the third and seventh [days]. @d1His impurity remains.@d2 Even if he immersed ritually. @p114@p2<EN>Anyone who enters the tent.@p3 @rr°@bbWhile the corpse is inside.<QC>
@p115@p2<EN>Any open utensil.@p3 Scripture refers to @rr°@bban earthen utensil, which does not admit ritual contamination from its outside, but from its inside. Thus, if its seal is not properly and securely fastened, it is defiled, but if there is a seal fastened to it, it is pure. @d1Fastened.@d2 @rr°@bbThe word denotes attachment in Arabic. Similarly, “I have been joined by Godly bonds”— I have been joined to my sister. @p116@p2<EN>In an open field.@p3 The Rabbis extrapolate, this includes @rr°@bbthe “@ITgollel@it” and “@ITdofek.@it”  Its plain meaning is that in the open field, where there is no tent, the corpse conveys defilement through touching.<QC>
@p119@p2<EN>He shall purify him on the seventh day.@p3 @rr°@bbThis completes the purification. @p120@p2<EN>A person who became ritually unclean, etc.@p3 If “@ITMikdash@it” was said, @rr°@bbwhy was “@ITMishkon@it” said?.<TIE>.<TIE>.etc., as stated in tractate Shevuos.<QC>
@p121@p2<EN>One who sprinkles the sprinkling waters.@p3 The Rabbis say @rr°@bbthat the sprinkler is actually pure, and that this teaches @rr°@bbthat one who carries the purifying water becomes extremely defiled, so as to contaminate the garments he wears , unlike one who touches [the water]. The reason it is expressed as “the sprinkler” is to teach that they (the waters) do not defile unless they contain a sufficient amount for sprinkling.<QC>
@d1One who touches, etc. shall remain unclean.@d2 @rr°@bbBut his garments do not require ritual washing. @p122@p2<EN>Anything which the unclean person touches.@p3 @rr°@bb[Which] this person who was defiled by a corpse [touches], shall become unclean. @d1And anyone touching.@d2 Him, @rr°@bbthe one defiled by the corpse. @d1Shall be ritually unclean until evening.@d2 Here we learn that a corpse is a “forefather” of defilement, and whoever touches it is the “father” of defilement, and defiles another person. This is the explanation according to its plain meaning and its halachic ramifications. Now I have transcribed the Midrash Aggadah from R’ Moshe Hadarshan’s basic commentary, as follows: @p12@p2<TIE>They shall take to you.@d2 From their own. Just as they removed the golden rings, for the [golden] calf, from their own, so shall they bring this from their own as atonement. @d1A red cow.@d2 This is compared to the child of a maidservant who sullied the king’s palace. They said, “let the child’s mother come and wipe away the filth.” Similarly, @rr°@bblet the cow come and atone for the calf. @d1Red.@d2 To correspond with “If they [your sins] are as red as crimson.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Sin is described as red. @d1Perfect.@d2 To correspond with the Israelites, who were perfect, but then were blemished by it. This [offering] shall come and atone for them, and they will return to their perfection. @d1Upon which no yoke was laid.@d2 Just as they discarded the yoke of Heaven. @p13@p2<TIE>To Elozor the @BIkohein.@it@d2 Just as they gathered against Aharon, the @ITkohein,@it [and forced him] to construct the calf. And since Aharon constructed the calf, this service was not performed by him, for, the accuser cannot serve as the defender. @p15@p2<TIE>[He] shall burn the cow.@d2 Just as the calf was burned. @p16@p2<TIE>Cedar wood, hyssop, and crimson wool.@d2 These three species correspond with the three thousand men who perished because of the calf. The cedar is the loftiest of all trees, the hyssop the lowest of all, signifying that someone haughty who sinned with arrogance must humble himself like the hyssop and the worm to gain atonement. @p19@p2<TIE>A keepsake.@d2 Just as the transgression of the calf, which is preserved throughout the generations for punishment, as there is no reckoning which does not include an accounting for the calf, as it is said, “on the day of my reckoning, I will take into account .<TIE>.<TIE>. [the sin of the calf], And @rr°@bbjust as the calf defiled everyone involved with it, so does the @ITparah@it defile everyone involved with it. Just as they were purified with its ashes, as it is said, “he scattered it on the water, etc.” so “they shall take, for the one defiled, from the dust of the burnt sin-offering, [and place, upon it, spring water.] @p11@p2<EN>The entire community.@p3 The entire, perfect community. @rr°@bbThose who were to die in the desert had already perished, and these were set apart to live.<QC>
@d1Miriam died there.@d2 @rr°@bbWhy is the portion concerning Miriam’s death adjacent to the portion of the @ITparah adumah@it? To teach you that, @rr°@bbjust as the sacrifices bring atonement, @rr°@bbso do the deaths of the righteous bring atonement. @d1Miriam died there.@d2 She, too, died @rr°@bbby the Divine kiss. @rr°@bbWhy, then, is it not said, concerning her, “by the mouth of God”? Because this would be lacking in reverence toward the Supreme Being. Concerning Aharon, however, it is said, “by the mouth of God,” in “these are the journeys.” @p12@p2<EN>The community had no water.@p3 From here [we derive] that all forty years they had @rr°@bbthe well in Miriam’s merit.<QC>
@p13@p2<EN>Would that we had died.@p3 @rr°@bbWe wish that we had died. @d1By our brothers’ death.@d2 @rr°@bbBy our brothers’ death from the plague, as death from thirst is more dreadful. @d1By .<TIE>.<TIE>. death.@d2 This is a noun, like @hh<HEB>בְּמִיתַת אַחֵינוּ@ee<ENG>, “by our brother’s death.” But it is incorrect to interpret this as “when our brothers died,” for, if so, the vocalization should have been @hh<HEB>בִּגְו‍ֹעַ@ee<ENG>.<QC>
@p18@p2<EN>And their livestock.@d2 @rr°@bbFrom here [we derive] that the Holy One, Blessed is He, is solicitous of the Israelites’ property.<QC>
@p110@p2<EN>Assembled, etc.@p3 This is one of the places @rr°@bbwhere a small area held a large multitude.<QC>
@d1Can we extract from this rock?@d2 @rr°@bbBecause they did not recognize it, as the rock settled itself among the other rocks when the well departed. The Israelites were telling them, “What [difference] is it to you, from which rock you extract water for us”? This is why he addressed them as “rebels “—”insolents,” “fools” in Greek. Those who instruct their instructors. Can we extract water from this rock for which we were not commanded? @p111@p2<EN>Twice.@p3 @rr°@bbBecause at first, it only produced drops, since the Omnipresent had not commanded to strike it, but “speak to the rock.” They spoke to a different rock, but it did not produce. They said, “perhaps it must be struck, like the first one,” as it is said, “strike the rock.” Then they happened upon that rock and he struck it. @p112@p2<EN>Because you did not believe in Me.@p3 @rr°@bbScripture reveals that @rr°@bbif it had not been for this single sin, they would have entered the land, so that it would not be said of them: @rr°@bb”Like the transgressions of the rest of the generation of the desert, against whom it was decreed not to enter the land— so was the transgression of Moshe and Aharon.” But @rr°@bbwas not [the transgression implied in the verse] “will sheep and cattle be slaughtered”? worse than this? Still, because it was said in private, Scripture was compassionate with him, but here, where it was in the presence of all of Israel, Scripture was not compassionate with him, because of the sanctification of the Name. @d1To sanctify me.@d2 For, if you had spoken to the rock and it had brought forth water, I would have been sanctified in the eyes of the community. They would have said: “Now this rock, which can neither speak nor hear, and does not require sustenance, fulfills the word of the Omnipresent. How much more should we do so.” @d1Therefore, you will not bring.@d2 This was said as an oath, like “Therefore, I swore to the house of Eili.” @rr°@bbHe swore precipituously, so that they would not engage in lengthy prayer. @p113@p2<EN>They are the waters of dispute.@p3 They are the ones mentioned elsewhere. Pharaoh’s astrologers saw them, [seeing] that the saviour of Israel would be smitten through water. Therefore, they decreed that “every boy who is born must be thrown into the river.” @d1He was sanctified through them.@d2 Since Moshe and Aharon died because of them. When the Holy One, Blessed is He, administers judgment against His holy ones, He is feared and sanctified by mankind. Similarly, it says, “You are awesome, God, from Your sanctuaries.” Similarly, it says, “I am sanctified by those close to Me.” @p114@p2<EN>Your brother Yisroel.@p3 Why did Moshe see fit to mention brotherhood here? But he said to him, “We are brothers, children of Avrohom, to whom it was said, ‘[Know] .<TIE>.<TIE>. that your descendants will be strangers [in a land that is not theirs]’, and we were both responsible for fulfilling that obligation.” @d1You know of all the hardship.@d2 Therefore, your father parted from our father, as it is said, “he went to a land because of his brother Yaakov” — @rr°@bbbecause of the bill of debt incumbent upon them, he placed the burden on Yaakov.<QC>
@p115@p2<EN>[The Egyptians] mistreated us.@p3 @rr°@bbWe endured much suffering. @d1And our forefathers.@d2 From here we derive @rr°@bbthat the forefathers suffer in the grave when punishment is visited on Israel. @p116@p2<EN>And He heard our voice.@p3 @rr°@bbThrough the blessing bestowed by our forefather [Yitzchak], “the voice is the voice of Yaakov.” For, we cry out, and are answered. @d1An emissary.@d2 @rr°@bbThis refers to Moshe. From here we derive that the prophets are called “emissaries” It also says, “they would insult the emissaries of God.” @p117@p2<EN>Please let us to pass through your land.@p3 @rr°@bbYou should not challenge the inheritance of the land of Israel, as you did not pay the debt. Do, for us, the small favor of passing through your land. @d1We will not drink well water.@d2 It should have said, “cistern water.” But this is what Moshe said: @rr°@bb”Although we have in our possession manna to eat and the well [water] to drink, we will not drink from it, but we will buy food and drink from you, for your benefit.” From here [we derive] that, although a guest has provisions in his possession, he should buy from the shopkeeper, in order to benefit his host. @d1We will travel by the king’s road.@d2 @rr°@bbWe will muzzle our animals, so that they will not turn every which way to eat. @p118@p2<EN>Lest I go out against you with the sword.@p3 You pride yourselves with the voice you inherited from your forefather, saying, “we cried out to God, and he heard our voice.” Well, I will go out against you @rr°@bbwith my forefather’s legacy, “you shall live by your sword.”<QC>
@p119@p2<EN>It is just nothing.@p3 Nothing at all will harm you. @p120@p2<EN>And a strong hand.@p3 @rr°@bbWith our grandfather’s assurance, “but the hands are the hands of Eisav.” @p122@p2<EN>The entire community.@p3 @rr°@bbAll of them, perfect, ready to enter the land. Not one of them was among those included in the decree, for those who were to die in the wilderness, had perished. These were among those of whom Scripture states, “You are all living this day.” @d1Mount Hor (lit. the mountain of the mountain).@d2 A mountain on top of a mountain, like a small apple on top of a large apple. Although the cloud went before them to flatten the mountains, three mountains remained; Mount Sinai for the Torah, Mount Hor for Aharon’s burial, and Mount Nevo for Moshe’s burial, @p123@p2<EN>At the border of the land of Edom.@p3 This teaches, that because they joined here in associating with the evil Eisav, a breach was made in their activities, and they lost this righteous man. Similarly, the prophet says to Yehoshafat, “when you joined with Achazyahu, God caused a breach in your activities.”<QC>
@p125@p2<EN>Take Aharon.@p3 With comforting words. Say to him, “How fortunate you are to see your crown handed over to your son— something which I do not merit.” @p126@p2<EN>[His] vestments.@p3 @rr°@bbIn the vestments of the @ITkehunah Gedolah@it, @rr°@bbhe dressed him, and then removed them from him, in order to place them on his son in his presence. @rr°@bbHe said to him, “Enter the cave.” He entered. He saw a bed made ready and a candle burning. He said, “Go up on the bed.” He went up. “Extend your hands.” He extended them. “Close your mouth.” He closed it. “Shut your eyes.” He shut them. Moshe at once desired to die such a death. This is why it was said to him, “The way your brother Aharon died”— The death which you desired. @p127@p2<EN>Moshe did.@p3 @rr°@bbAlthough the matter was difficult for him, he did not hesitate. @p129@p2<EN>The entire community saw.@p3 @rr°@bbWhen they saw Moshe and Elozor descending, and Aharon did not desend, they said,”Where is Aharon”? He said to them, “He died.” They said, “Can it be that someone who stood up to the angel and stopped the plague is under the dominion of the angel of death”? Moshe immediately begged for mercy, and the ministering angels showed him to them, lying in the bed. They saw, and believed. @d1The entire house of Yisroel.@d2 Men and women, @rr°@bbbecause Aharon pursued peace, and instilled affection between antagonists, and between husband and wife. @d1That [Aharon] died.@d2 I say that anyone who translates [@hh<HEB>כִּי גָוַע@ee<ENG> as] @hh<HEB>דְּהָא מִית@ee<ENG> (“because [Aharon] died”), is mistaken, unless he also translates @hh<HEB>וַיִּרְאוּ@ee<ENG> as @hh<HEB> וְאִתְחֲזִיאוּ@ee<ENG> ([The community] “was exposed”). Since the Rabbis’ comment, that @hh<HEB>כִּי@ee<ENG> here is understood as “because,” is valid only according to the Midrashic comment that the clouds of glory departed, as R’ Abohu said, “do not read @hh<HEB>וַיִּרְאוּ@ee<ENG> (‘they [the community] saw,’), but @hh<HEB>וַיֵּרָאוּ@ee<ENG>, (‘they [the community] were exposed’ ).” According to this interpretation, @hh<HEB>דְּהָא@ee<ENG> (“because”), is the proper usage, since it clarifies what precedes it. Why were they exposed? Because Aharon died. However, according to Targum [Onkelos who translates] “the entire community saw,” “because” is not the proper usage, but “that,” from the @hh<HEB>אִי@ee<ENG> meaning, as we find @hh<HEB>אִם@ee<ENG> meaning “that.” As in, “that [I ask], why shouldn’t I be distressed”?Sf?  and many clear usages in this sense, [like] “that his days are designated.” @p11@p2<EN>The Canaanite heard.@p3 @rr°@bbHe heard that Aharon died, and the clouds of glory departed, etc. as stated in Rosh Hashanah. Amelek was always a whip for disciplining Israel, prepared, at all times, to mete out punishment.<QC>
@d1Who lived in the south.@d2 @rr°@bbThis was Amalek, as it is said, “Amelek dwells in the southern part of the land.” They changed their language, and spoke in the Canaanite tongue, so that the Israelites would pray to the Holy One, Blessed is He, to deliver the Canaanites into their hands —but they were not Canaanites. The Israelites saw that they were dressed in Amalekite clothing, but spoke the Canaanite tongue. They said, “let us pray in a general way,” as it is said, “if you will deliver this people into my hand.” @d1By the route of the spies.@d2 The negev route traveled by the spies, as it is said, “they went up to the negev.” Another interpretation of @hh<HEB>דֶּרֶךְ הָאֲתָרִים@ee<ENG>; the route of @rr°@bbthe great pathfinder which traveled before them, as it is said, “[the Ark of the covenant of God traveled before them] three days’ journey, to seek out a resting place for them.” @d1He took from them a captive.@d2 It was only @rr°@bbone maidservant. @p12@p2<EN>I shall consecrate.@p3 @rr°@bbI shall consecrate the spoils to heaven.<QC>
@p13@p2<EN>And he destroyed them.@p3 By execution. @d1And [consecrated] their cities.@d2 He consecrated them to heaven. @p14@p2<EN>By the Reed Sea route.@p3 @rr°@bbSince Aharon had died, and this war fell upon them, they turned back to the Reed Sea route This was the route by which they had turned back when the decree of the spies was issued against them, as it is said, “travel into the desert, by the Reed Sea route.” Here, they turned back seven journeys, as it is said, “Bnei Yisroel journeyed from Be’eiros Bnei Yaakan to Moseirah. There, Aharon died.” Was it in Moseirah that Aharon died? Did he not die at Mount Hor? @rr°@bbBut they returned there, and mourned and eulogized him as if he were in their presence. Go, examine the journeys, and you will find seven journeys from Moseirah to Mount Hor. @d1To circle around the land of Edom.@d2 Since they did not permit them to pass through their land. @d1Traveling was insufferable to the people (lit. “the people’s souls did not have the capacity for traveling”).@d2 Because of the rigors of travel, which were overly difficult for them. They said, “We were just close to entering the land, and we are turning back. This was how our fathers turned back, and they remained for thirty-eight years, until this day.” Therefore, the distress of traveling was insufferable. “@ITEncrot lor@it” [“repulsive to them”, in old French]. But it would be improper to translate “the people experienced insufferability @hh<HEB>בַּדֶּרֶךְ@ee<ENG>, while traveling,” without specification of the cause of the insufferability; since, wherever one finds insufferability in Scripture, the cause is specified. For example, “they were insufferable to me.” And, for example, “Israel’s distress was insufferable to him.” Anything overly difficult for a person is depicted as @hh<HEB>קִצּוּר נֶפֶשׁ@ee<ENG> (lit. the incapacity of the soul), like a person beset by travail, who lacks the breadth of mind to accept that, and who does not have a place in his heart where the distress might reside. Now, the thing causing distress is depicted as looming large, since it is seems large and weighs heavily on the person. For example, “their souls loomed over me” —seemed large to me. [And, for example,] “Trapping me like a lion looms large.” The synopsis of the interpretation: Every statement expressing the soul’s incapacity for a thing means that it cannot tolerate it, for the mind cannot tolerate it. @p15@p2<EN>Against God and Moshe.@p3 They equated the servant with his master. @d1Why did you bring us up.@d2 Both of them, equally. @d1We (our souls) are disgusted.@d2 This, too, denotes insufferability and disgust. @d1With this rotten bread.@d2 Because the manna was absorbed into the limbs, they called it rotten. They said, @rr°@bb“the manna will eventually swell in our stomachs. @rr°@bbCan anyone born of a woman take in [food] without excreting? @p16@p2<EN>The consuming (lit. burning) snakes.@p3 @rr°@bbThat consume a man with the venom in their fangs. @d1And they bit the people.@d2 Let the snake, who was smitten for speaking wickedly, come and punish those who spoke wickedly. Let the snake, for whom every type [of food] tastes the same, come and punish the ingrates, for whom one thing changed to numerous tastes.<QC>
@p17@p2<EN>Moshe prayed.@p3 From here we derive that someone from whom forgiveness is asked should not be mercilessly unpardoning. @p18@p2<EN>Upon a banner.@p3 On a pole, called “@ITperche@it” in old French. Similarly, “like a banner on the hill,” “I shall lift my banner,” “raise the banner.” @rr°@bbBecause it is held high as a signal and as verification, it is called @hh<HEB>נֵס@ee<ENG>. @d1Anyone bitten.@d2 @rr°@bbEven if a dog or donkey bit him, he would sicken and @rr°@bbdeteriorate steadily, except that the snakebite killed quickly. This is why it says here “.<TIE>.<TIE>. who saw it” — at a glance. But regarding the snakebite, it says “.<TIE>.<TIE>. he gazed,” “.<TIE>.<TIE>. if a snake bit a man, he gazed, etc.,” as the snakebite was not quick to heal unless he gazed at it with concentration. The Rabbis said, @rr°@bb”Can a snake bring death or life? Rather, when the Israelites gazed heavenward and subjugated their hearts to their Father in heaven, they would heal, but if not, they would waste away.” @p19@p2<EN>A copper snake.@p3 He was not told to make it of copper, but Moshe said: “The Holy One, Blessed is He, called it “@hh<HEB>נָחָשׁ@ee<ENG>“ @rr°@bb(“snake,”) so I shall make it of “@hh<HEB>נְחֹשֶׁת@ee<ENG>“ (“copper”). The terminology is well matched. @p111@p2<EN>In the wasteland passes.@p3 @rr°@bbI do not know why they were called @hh<HEB>עִיִּים@ee<ENG> (“wasteland”). @hh<HEB>עִי@ee<ENG> denotes desolation, [like] something swept clean @rr°@bbwith a broom. Only the @hh<HEB>עַיִ''ן@ee<ENG> is the root. It has the same meaning as @hh<HEB>יָעִים@ee<ENG> (“scoops”), and as @hh<HEB>וְיָעָה בָרָד@ee<ENG> (“hail shall sweep away”). @d1Passes.@d2 This was the passage route @rr°@bbfor those crossing Mount Nevo into the land of Canaan. It (Mount Nevo) separated the territory of Moav from the land of the Emorites. @d1Facing Moav, eastward of the sun.@d2 East of the land of Moav. @p113@p2<EN>From the Emorite border.@p3 The boundary, @rr°@bbthe edge of their border. Similarly, “the border of Moav”, meaning the edge, the end. @d1Opposite Arnon.@d2 They circled the entire southern and eastern territory of Moav, until they reached the other side, at Arnon, inside Emorite territory, north of Moav. @d1Extending from the Emorite border.@d2 A strip extends from the Emorite border, and it belongs to the Emorites, but penetrates the boundary of Moav until Arnon, the Moavite border. The Israelites camped there without entering the border of Moav, Arnon being the Moav border, and they did not grant them permission to pass through their land. Although Moshe did not state this clearly, Yiftach did, as was said by Yiftach, “he (Moshe) also sent [a request] to the king of Moav, but he was unwilling.” Moshe alluded to this: “Just as they did to me, the children of Eisav, who dwell in Seir, and the Moavites, who dwell in Ar,” Just as these [children of Eisav] did not permit them to pass through their land, but they circled around them, so it was with Moav. @p114@p2<EN>Concerning this will be told.@p3 @rr°@bbConcerning this encampment, and the miracles performed in it. @d1Will be told in the Book of Wars of Adonoy.@d2 When they recount the miracles performed for our forefathers, they will recount that “He gave, etc.” @d1He gave.@d2 Like @hh<HEB>אֶת יָהֵב@ee<ENG>. Just as we transpose @hh<HEB>יָעֹד@ee<ENG> into @hh<HEB>וָעֹד@ee<ENG>, we also transpose @hh<HEB>וָהֵב@ee<ENG> into @hh<HEB>יָהֵב@ee<ENG>, the @hh<HEB> וָי"ו@ee<ENG> being basic. As if to say, “that He gave them, and wrought many miracles at the Reed Sea.” @d1And the valleys of Arnon.@d2 Just as we recount the miracles of the Reed Sea, so should we recount the miracles of the valleys of Arnon, since here, too, great miracles were wrought. What are the miracles?<QC>
@p115@p2<EN>The spillage in the valleys.@p3 The Targum of @hh<HEB>שֶׁפֶךְ@ee<ENG> (“spillage,”) is @hh<HEB>אֶשֶׁד@ee<ENG>. The spillage in the valleys [was as follows]— the blood of the Emorites spilled there, as they were hidden there. Because there were high cliffs, with a deep, narrow valley. The cliffs were near each other— a man could stand on one of them, and converse with a friend on the other— and the road went through the valley. The Emorites said, “When the Israelites enter the valley to pass through, let us go out of the caves in the cliffs above them, and kill them with arrows and stone projectiles.” Now those cavities were in the mountain on the Moavite side, and in the mountain on the side of the Emorites, opposite the cavities, were horn-like projections, resembling breasts. @rr°@bbWhen the Israelites came to pass through, the Eretz Yisroel mountain was set in tremor like a maidservant going forth to receive her mistress, and moved next to the mountain on the Moavite side. The breasts entered the cavities and killed them. this is [the meaning of] “when it turned to dwell at Ar,” as the mountain leaned away from its place, and moved next to the side of the Moavite border, and attached itself to it. And this is [the meaning of] “and then leaned on the border of Moav.” @p116@p2<EN>From there, to the well.@p3 From there, the spillage came to the well. How was this? The Holy One, Blessed is He, said, “Who will inform My children of these miracles?” The parable says, ‘if you gave the baby bread, tell his mother.’ After they passed, the mountains returned to their places, and the well descended to the valley, and brought up, from there, the blood of those who were killed, and their arms and limbs, and carried them around the camp. The Israelites saw, and sang. @p117@p2<EN>Arise, O well.@p3 @rr°@bbFrom within the valley, and lift what you are to bring up. How do we know that the well informed them? As it is said, “from there to the well.” @rr°@bbWas it from there? Was it not with them at the beginning of the forty years? But, it descended to make the miracles known. Similarly, “then, Yisroel sang this song” was said at the end of forty years, but the well was given to them at the beginning of the forty years. Why was it seen fit to have been written here? Only because this subject is expounded in relation to the above text. @p118@p2<EN>The well dug [by princes].@p3 This is the well dug by the princes, Moshe and Aharon. @d1With their staffs.@d2 With the rod. @d1From the wilderness.@d2 It was given to them. @p119@p2<EN>After it was given, it became a legacy.@p3 As rendered by Targum [Onkelos].<QC>
@p120@p2<EN>From the heights to the valley in the field of Moav.@p3 @rr°@bbAs there Moshe died, @rr°@bband there the well was discontinued. Another interpretation of “The nobles of the nation excavated”: Each tribal leader, when they encamped, took his staff and drew it to his banner and camp. The well water followed the path made by that mark, and reached each the camp of each tribe. @d1Through the lawgiver.@d2 Through Moshe, who was called the lawgiver, as it is said, “for there, the portion of the lawgiver is reserved.” @rr°@bbWhy is Moshe not mentioned in this song? Because he was afflicted through the well. And since Moshe’s name is not mentioned, the Name of the God, is not mentioned. This is compared to a king who was invited to a banquet. he said, ‘If my intimate friend is there, I will be there, but if not, I will not go.’ @d1At the top of the peak.@d2 As Targum [Onkelos] translates, “the top of the height.” @d1The peak.@d2 This denotes a high point. Similarly, @hh<HEB>פַּסְּגוּ אַרְמְנוֹתֶיהָ@ee<ENG>—”raise its castles.”<QC>
@d1That overlooks.@d2 @rr°@bbThat peak, facing the place called Yeshimon. The word [Yeshimon] denotes a wilderness, a desolate place. @rr°@bbAnother interpretation: The well may be seen on the face of the desolate place. It (the well) was hidden in the sea of Teveriah, and someone standing on the desolate place may look intently and observe a type of sieve in the sea— this is the well. This was expounded by R’ Tanchuma. @p121@p2<EN>Yisroel sent emissaries.@p3 But elsewhere, the communication is attributed to Moshe, as it is said, “I sent emissaries from the eastern wilderness.” Similarly, “Moshe sent emissaries from Kadesh to the king of Edom”, but about Yiftach it says, “Israel sent emissaries to the king of Edom, etc.” These passages are mutually instructive, one closes, while the other opens. Moshe is Yisroel, Yisroel is Moshe, to teach you that the leader of the generation is like the entire generation. The leader is everything. @p122@p2<EN>Let me pass through your land.@p3 @rr°@bbAlthough they were not commanded to offer a peace overture, they made a peaceful proposal. @p123@p2<EN>Sichon did not allow, etc.@p3 Since all the Canaanite kings @rr°@bbdelivered tribute to him, for he protected them from armies passing through against them. When Yisroel said to him, “Let me pass through your land,” he said, “My very presence here is to protect them from you, and you say this”? @d1And [he] went out against Israel.@d2 If Cheshbon had been filled with gnats, no creature could have conquered it. And if Sichon had been in a feeble village, no man could have conquered him, And certainly, since he was in Cheshbon. The Holy One, Blessed is He, said, @rr°@bb”Why should I incovenience My children with all this besieging of every single city”? He prompted all the warriors into deciding to leave the cities, and they all gathered in one place, where they were slain. From there, the Israelites went to the cities without opposition, since no one was there, except the women and children. @p124@p2<EN>Because [the border] was impregnable.@p3 What was its strength? The admonishment by The Holy one, Blessed is He, who said to them, “do not oppress them, etc.” @p125@p2<EN>Its daughters.@p3 The villages nearby.<QC>
@p126@p2<EN>He had waged war.@p3 Why was it necessary for this to have been written? Because it is said, “do not oppress Moav,” and Cheshbon belonged to Moav. Scripture [therefore] writes, for us, that Sichon confiscated it from them, and it was purified for Israel through him. @d1From his hand.@d2 From his possesion. @p127@p2<EN>Concerning this.@p3 Concerning this war fought by Sichon against Moav. @d1The parable tellers say.@d2 Bil’am, of whom it is said, “he set forth his parable.” @d1The parable tellers.@d2 Bil’am and Beor. They said: @d1Come to Cheshbon.@d2 Since Sichon was unable to conquer it, he hired Bil’am to curse it. This is why Balak said to him, “for I know that what you bless is blessed, etc.” @d1May it be built and established.@d2 @rr°@bbCheshbon, under Sichon’s name, to be his city.<QC>
@p128@p2<EN>For, a fire went forth from Cheshbon.@p3 @rr°@bbAfter Sichon conquered it. @d1It consumed Ar, of Moav.@d2 The name of that country is called “Ar” in the Hebrew language, and “Lechayas” in the Aramaic language. @d1Ar, of Moav.@d2 @rr°@bbAr, belonging to Moav. @p129@p2<EN>Woe to you, O Moav.@p3 They cursed Moav @rr°@bbthat he be delivered into his hands.<QC>
@d1Kemosh.@d2 The name of the Moavite deity. @d1He rendered.@d2 Whoever rendered, “his sons”—Moav’s. @d1Refugees.@d2 Who fled and escaped the sword, and his daughters into captivity, etc. @p130@p2<EN>Their kingdom was uprooted.@p3 [@hh<HEB>וַנִּירָם@ee<ENG> is translated as] their kingdom. @d1Was uprooted from Cheshbon, as far as Divon.@d2 The kingdom and authority Moav had in Cheshbon, was uprooted from there. Similarly, @rr°@bb”as far as Divon.” The Targum of @hh<HEB>סָר@ee<ENG>, “was removed,” is @hh<HEB>עַד@ee<ENG>. As if to say, the kingdom was removed from Divon. @hh<HEB>נִיר@ee<ENG> denotes monarchy, authority, a man’s power, Similarly, “so that the monarchy shall remain with My servant David.” @d1We made them desolate.@d2 The @hh<HEB>שִׁ"ין@ee<ENG> is punctuated, denoting desolation. This is what the parable tellers said: @hh<HEB>וַנַּשִּׁים אוֹתָם עַד נֹפַח@ee<ENG>, “We made them desolate until Nofach.”<QC>
@p132@p2<EN>Moshe sent [men] to spy on Ya’zer.@p3 @rr°@bbThe spies captured it. They said, we will not act like the first ones; We have [enough] faith, in the power of Moshe’s prayer, to do battle. @p134@p2<EN>Do not be afraid of him.@p3 @rr°@bbMoshe was afraid to do battle, for perhaps, the merit of Avrohom, would stand for him [Og] as it is said, “the one who had escaped came.” This was Og, who escaped, of the Rephaim whom Kedorlaomer and his cohorts smote in Ashteros Karnayim, as it is said, “for only Og, king of Bashan, was left of the remaining Rephaim.” @p135@p2<EN>They killed him.@p3 Moshe killed him, as stated in Berachos, in [the chapter of] Haroeh. He uprooted a mountain three @ITparsaos@it long, etc.<QC>
@p12@p2<EN>Balak saw .<TIE>.<TIE>. all that Yisroel had done to the Emorite.@p3 @rr°@bbHe said, “Those two kings whom we relied on could not withstand them, @rr°@bbcertainly we can not.” Therefore, “Moav became terrified.” @p13@p2<EN>[Moav] became terrified.@p3 The word denotes fear, as in “fear for yourselves.”<QC>
@d1Moav detested.@d2 @rr°@bbThey detested their lives, similar to “I am disgusted with my life.” This is a shortened sentence. @p14@p2<EN>To the elders of Midian.@p3 @rr°@bbBut were they not ancient enemies, as it is said, “who attacked Midian in the field of Moav,” when Midian went to war against Moav? Still, because of their fear of Yisroel, they made peace. But @rr°@bbwhy did Moav see fit to accept advice from Midian? When they saw the supernatural victories of Yisroel, they said, “Their leader was raised in Midian. Let us ask them what his character is.” They told them: “He has no power, except with the mouth.” They said, “We, too, will confront them with a man whose power is with his mouth.” @d1Just as the ox laps up.@d2 @rr°@bbWhatever an ox laps up is no longer marked by blessing. @d1At that time.@d2 He was unsuited for royalty. He was @rr°@bbone of the chieftains of Midian, and when Sichon died, he was appointed over them temporarily. @p15@p2<EN>To Pesor.@p3 @rr°@bbLike the money changer, to whom everyone dispatches money. Similarly,<QC>
@p3all the monarchs @rr°@bbdispatched their correspondence to him. According to the plain meaning of the passage, @rr°@bbthis was the name of the place. @d1The land of his people.@d2 Balak’s — he came from there. This person (Bil’am) @rr°@bbprophesied, and said to him, “You are destined to be a king.” @rr°@bbShould you ask, why did the Holy One, Blessed is He, visit His Divine Presence on an evil gentile? So that the nations might not extenuate themselves by saying, “If we had prophets, we would have repented.” He established prophets for them, and they breached a universal barrier; they had originally refrained from promiscuity, but this person (Bil’am) advised them to indulge freely in promiscuity. @d1To call him.@d2 The invitation was his, @rr°@bbfor his benefit, as he offered him a large sum of money.<QC>
@d1A nation came out of Egypt.@d2 @rr°@bbYou may ask, “Why is this harmful to you”? @d1Behold, they have covered the face of the earth.@d2 @rr°@bbSichon and Og, who were our guardians, were killed by them. @d1And is located across from me.@d2 @rr°@bbThis is written incompletely. They are nearby, to cut me down, as in, “I cut them down.”<QC>
@p16@p2<EN>[Enable] us to strike at him.@p3 @rr°@bbMy people and I will strike at them. Another interpretation: This term is found in the Mishnah, “He reduces the price for him” — @rr°@bbto diminish them a little. @d1For I know, etc.@d2 Through the war of Sichon, whom you assisted in striking down Moav.<QC>
@p17@p2<EN>With magic chas in their hands.@p3 @rr°@bbAll types of magic charms, so that he could not say, “My tools are not with me.” Another interpretation. The elders of Midian took up this mystical omen: They said, “If he comes with us this time, there is something to him; but if he rebuffs us, it is useless.” This is why, when he said to them, “Spend the night here,” they said, “It is hopeless.” They left him there and departed, as it is said, “the Moavite chieftains stayed with Bil’am,” @rr°@bbbut the elders of Midian departed. @p18@p2<EN>Spend this night here.@p3 The Sacred spirit visits him only at night. It is the same with all of the gentile prophets, and it was the same with Lavan — in a dream at night, as it is said, “God appeared to Lavan the Aramean in a dream that night,” like a man who visits his concubine secretly. @d1According to what Adonoy tells me.@d2 If He advises me to go with people like you, I will go with you. @rr°@bbPerhaps it is beneath His dignity to allow me to go, unless it is with higher ranking officials than you. @d1Remained (lit. sat)@d2 The word denotes remaining.<QC>
@p19@p2<EN>Who are these men with you?@p3 @rr°@bbHe gave him the opportunity for error. He (Bil’am) said, “At times, not everything is revealed to Him. He is not omniscient. So I shall divine a time when I can curse without his understanding.” @p110@p2<EN>Balak son of Tzipor, etc.@p3 Although I am not distinguished in Your eyes,<FJ> @rr°@bbI am distinguished in the eyes of kings. @p111@p2<EN>Curse for me.@p3 @rr°@bbThis [@hh<HEB>קָבָה לִּי@ee<ENG>] is harsher than @hh<HEB>אָרָה לִּי@ee<ENG>, @rr°@bbas it is specific and clear. @d1And banish him.@d2 @rr°@bbFrom the world. Balak only said, “I will banish them from the land,” I seek only to get them away from me. Bil’am hated them more than Balak. @p112@p2<EN>Do not go with them.@p3 @rr°@bbHe (Bil’am) said to Him, “if so, I will curse them here.” He (God) said to him, “You shall not curse the people.” He (Bil’am) said to Him, “If so, I will bless them.” He (God) said to him, “They do not need your blessing.” @d1For they are blessed.@d2 [This follows] the proverb: One says to the wasp, “Neither your honey nor your sting.” @p113@p2<EN>To go with you.@p3 But with higher ranking officials than you. @rr°@bbWe learn that he was arrogant, and was unwilling to reveal that he was under God’s domination, except in insolent terms. Therefore, “Balak persisted.<TIE>.<TIE>.”<QC>
@p117@p2<EN>I will honor you greatly.@p3 @rr°@bbMore than you have received in the past, I will give you. @p118@p2<EN>Silver and gold enough to fill his house.@p3 @rr°@bbWe learn that he was avaricious, and he coveted the money of others. He said, “He should rightfully give me all his gold and silver, since he would have to hire great armies, which may or may not succeed, whereas I will certainly succeed.”<QC>
@d1I cannot transgress.@d2 He was forced to reveal that he was dominated by others. @rr°@bbAnd he prophesied here that he would be unable to nullify the blesings which the patriarchs received by word of the Divine Presence. @p119@p2<EN>You also.@p3 His mouth ensnared him. You, too, will, in the end, leave @rr°@bbin frustration, like the first ones. @d1What more will [Adonoy tell me].@d2 @rr°@bbHe will not alter his word from a blessing to a curse. Would that he does not add a blessing. Here, he prophesied that He (God) would bless them further through him (Bil’am).<QC>
@p120@p2<EN>If [the men have come] to call you.@p3 If the invitation is for you, any you expect remuneration, then rise and go with them. @d1However.@d2 In spite of you, whatever I will say to you, you will do. Nevertheless, “Bil’am went.” He said, “perhaps I can convince him to agree.”<QC>
@p121@p2<EN>[He] saddled his donkey.@p3 From here [we derive] that hatred breeds impropriety — @rr°@bbhe saddled it himself. The Holy One, Blessed is He, said, “Evil one, their patriarch Avrohom has already preceded you”! as it is said: “Avrohom rose early and saddled his donkey.” @d1With the Moavite dignitaries.@d2 His heart (intent) was exactly the same as theirs. @p122@p2<EN>Because he went.@p3 @rr°@bbHe saw that the thing was evil in the Omnipresent’s eyes, and yet he craved to go. @d1To thwart him.@d2 @rr°@bbHe was an angel of mercy, who wanted to prevent him from sinning, so that he would not sin and perish. @d1Accompanied by his two attendants.@d2 From here we derive that when a distinguished person embarks on a journey, @rr°@bbhe should bring along two people to attend him, who will, in turn, @rr°@bbattend to one another. @p123@p2<EN>The donkey saw.@p3 But he [Bilam] did not see, for the Holy One, Blessed is He, granted an animal greater perception than a man, who, because of his intelligence, would become deranged from the perception of destructive spirits.<QC>
@d1With his sword drawn in his hand.@d2 He said, @rr°@bb”This evil one abandoned the tools of his trade, for the weapon of the gentile nations is the sword, whereas he accosted them with his mouth, which is their calling. So I will take hold of his [tool], and accost him with his calling. This, too, is the way he came to his end — “and Bil’am the son of B’or, they killed with the sword.” @p124@p2<EN>In a narrow path.@p3 As Targum [Onkelos] renders, @hh<HEB>בִּשְׁבִיל@ee<ENG>, “in the path.” Similarly, “If the dust of Shomron is sufficient for the paths<TIE>.<TIE>. <TIE>.,” the dust which attaches itself to the soles of the feet when walking. Similarly, “Who measured the waters with his step”? with his feet, when walking. @d1With a barrier at either side.@d2 @rr°@bbUnless specified otherwise, @hh<HEB>גָּדֵר@ee<ENG>, refers to a barrier of stone. @p125@p2<EN>She was pressed.@p3 She (the donkey), herself.<QC>
@d1And pressed.@d2 Others — Bil’am’s foot. @p126@p2<EN>Adonoy’s angel passed further ahead.@p3 Passing further before him, proceeding @rr°@bbto place himself before him in a different place, as in, “he passed before them.” There is a Midrash Aggadah in Tanchuma: Why did he see fit to stop in three places? @rr°@bbHe showed him the signs of the patriarchs.<QC>
@p128@p2<EN>These three times (lit. legs).@p3 He hinted to him: “You seek to uproot a people @rr°@bbwhich celebrates three pilgrimages a year?”<QC>
@p129@p2<EN>You ridiculed.@p3 This follows Targum [Onkelos]. The word denotes insult and humiliation. @d1Would that I had a sword in my hand.@d2 @rr°@bbThis matter was extremely disparaging for him in the eyes of the dignitaries. This man is en route to kill an entire nation verbally, yet, for this donkey, he requires weapons of war! @p130@p2<EN>Was it ever my habit.@p3 This follows Targum [Onkelos]. Similarly, “does man benefit God by learning”? The Rabbis extrapolate this passage in the Talmud: They (the dignitaries) said to him, “Why are you not riding a horse”? He (Bil’am) said to them, @rr°@bb”I sent it out to pasture,” etc., as stated in Maseches Avodah Zarah.<QC>
@p132@p2<EN>Because your way is contrary to me.@p3 Our Rabbis, the sages of the Mishnah, expound this as @rr°@bban acronym: “She was afraid [of me], she saw [me], and she turned, because the course is against me,” @rr°@bbas if to say, “to arouse my vengefulness, and to anger me.” According to the plain interpretation, “because the course hurried against me.” @rr°@bbThe word [@hh<HEB>יָרַט@ee<ENG>] denotes hurrying. @rr°@bbBecause I saw that the traveler along the course (Bil’am) hastened and hurried on the course to anger and defy me. @rr°@bbThis is a shortened passage, similar to “Dovid longed.” @rr°@bbAnother interpretation: @hh<HEB>יָרַט@ee<ENG> denotes desire. Similarly, “through the wicked, He strives for my good will,” He attempts to appease and comfort me through the wicked, who only anger me. @p133@p2<EN>Had she not turned aside.@p3 @rr°@bbLike @hh<HEB>לוּלֵא@ee<ENG>, “if not.” Sometimes @hh<HEB>אוּלַי@ee<ENG>, (lit. “perhaps”) is used to connote @hh<HEB>לוּלֵא@ee<ENG>, “if not.” @d1I would surely have killed you.@d2 @rr°@bbThis verse should be rearranged, to read “I would also have killed you.” As if to say, @rr°@bb”Not only would you have been restrained by me, but you also would have been killed.” @d1And she, I would let live.@d2 But now, @rr°@bbbecause she spoke and admonished you, and you were unable to withstand her admonishment as it is written, “He said, ‘No”’ — I killed her, so that it should not be said, “this is the one that drove away Bil’am with her admonishment, and he was unable to reply.” For the Omnipresent is solicitous with human dignity. Similarly, “you shall kill the woman and the animal.”  Similarly, “kill the animal.” @p134@p2<EN>Because I did not know.@p3 This, too, was disparaging, but he was forced to concede. He had boasted that he could divine the thoughts of Heaven, but his own mouth bore witness, “I did not know.” @d1If it is wicked in your eyes, I shall return.@d2 This reply was @rr°@bban attack against the Omnipresent. He (Bil’am) said to him, “He Himself commanded me to go, yet you, an angel, are nullifying His words. This is customary with Him — He says something, and an angel withdraws it. He said to Avrohom, ‘please take your son, etc.’ then nullified His words through an angel. I, too, if it is wicked in your eyes, must return.” @p135@p2<EN>Go with the men.@p3 @rr°@bbA man is led along the path he wishes to follow. @d1But.@d2 @rr°@bbIn spite of your wishes, “the word that I will speak.” @d1Go with the men.@d2 @rr°@bbSince your portion is with them — in the end you will perish from the earth.<QC>
@d1With Balak’s dignitaries.@d2 He reveled in cursing them as much as they. @p136@p2<EN>Balak heard.@p3 He dispatched emissaries to inform him. @d1To the city of Moav.@d2 @rr°@bbTo his metropolis, his most prominent city, as if to say, “Look at what they are trying to uproot”!<QC>
@p137@p2<EN>Am I really incapable of honoring you?@p3 @rr°@bbHe prophesied that he would, in the end, depart from him in disgrace.<QC>
@p139@p2<EN>Kiryas Chutzos@p3 The city filled with market places, with men, women, and children in its outer areas. As if to say, “observe, and take pity, so that they will not be uprooted.” @p140@p2<EN>Cattle and sheep.@p3 @rr°@bbA small amount — only one of the cattle, and one sheep.<QC>
@p141@p2<EN>Bamos Ba’al.@p3 As Targum [Onklos] renders, “To the heights of his deity.” [Ba’al is] the name of an idol. @p13@p2<EN>Perhaps, Adonoy will appear to me.@p3 @rr°@bbHe does not usually speak with me by day. @d1He went away alone.@d2 As Targum [Onkelos] translates, “alone.” The word denotes placidity and quiet, as nothing but silence accompanied him. @p14@p2<EN>Chanced to appear.@p3 The word denotes a casual occurrence; it denotes disgrace; @rr°@bbit denotes the uncleanness of seminal emission. As if to say, “reluctantly and in humiliation.” He appeared to him by day only in order to display the preciousness of Bnei Yisroel.’ @d1The seven altars.@d2 “I have arranged seven altars” is not written here, but @hh<HEB>אֶת־שִׁבְעַת הַמִּזְבְּחֹת@ee<ENG>. He (Bil’am) said before Him: “Their patriarchs built seven altars before you, so I arranged [altars] to correspond with all of them. Avrohom built four: “He built an altar there to God, who had appeared to him.” “From there, he moved to the mountain, etc.,” “Avraham pitched his tent, etc.,” and one on Mount Moriah. Yitzchak built one: “He built an altar there, etc.” Ya’akov built two: One in Shechem, and one in Beis El. @d1And I offered an ox and a ram on the altar.@d2 @rr°@bbBut Avraham only offered up a single ram.<QC>
@p17@p2<EN>Curse Yaakov for me; Go, invoke wrath against Yisroel.@p3 He instructed him to curse them @rr°@bbwith both names, in case one of them was not the principal one. @p18@p2<EN>How can I curse, when God has not cursed.@p3 @rr°@bbWhen they deserved to have been cursed, they were not cursed. When their father mentioned their sin, “For they killed a man in their rage,” he cursed only their rage, as it is said, “Cursed is their rage.” When their father entered deceitfully to his father, he deserved to have been cursed. What is said there? “Let him also be blessed.” Of those who were to declare blessings it is said, “these [tribes] shall stand to bless the people.” Of those who were to declare curses, is not said, “these shall stand to curse the people,” but “these shall stand at the curse” — He did not want to invoke the word “curse” against them. @d1If Adonoy has not been angry.@d2 I have no power, except that I know how to pinpoint the moment when the Holy One, Blessed is He, is angry. @rr°@bbBut He was not angry during all those days that I came to you. This is why it is said, “My people, remember, now, what [Balak] advised, etc., and what Bil’am replied to him, etc., so that you may know God’s righteousness.” @p19@p2<EN>For I view it from the mountain peaks (lit. head of the mountains).@d2 I gaze at their origins, the beginnings of their roots, and I perceive that they are well founded @rr°@bband powerful, like the mountains and the hills, because of the patriarchs and the matriarchs. @d1Behold! A people which shall dwell alone.@d2 @rr°@bbThis was acquired for them by their forefathers — to dwell alone, as rendered by Targum [Onkelos]. @d1And will not be reckoned among the nations.@d2 As Targum [Onkelos] explains, they will not be annihilated with the other nations, as it is said, “for I shall annihilate all the nations, etc.” They will not be reckoned with the rest. @rr°@bbAnother interpretation: When they rejoice, no nation rejoices with them, as it is said, “God shall give them repose alone.” But when the nations prosper, they partake with each of them, without debiting the balance of their account. This is [the meaning of] “and will not be reckoned among the nations.”  @p110@p2<EN>Who can count the dust of Yaakov.@p3 @rr°@bbAs Targum [Onkelos] interprets, “the children of the house of Yaakov, etc., .<TIE>.<TIE>. of the four camps” — of the four banners. @rr°@bbAnother interpretation [of] the dust of Yaakov, One cannot reckon the commandments which they perform with dust. “Do not plow with an ox and a donkey,” “do not plant @ITkilayim,@it” the dust of the [red] cow, the dust of the @ITsotah,@it and similar ones. @d1Or count the seed of Yisroel.@d2 @rr°@bbThe seed which emanates during their intercourse. @d1May my soul die the death of the righteous.@d2 @rr°@bbAmong them. @p113@p2<EN>Curse them for me.@p3 The word denotes a command: “Curse them for me.” @p114@p2<EN>Field of Tzofim.@p3 This was an elevated area where a lookout was stationed to watch for forces which might approach the city. @d1To the peak of the mountain.@d2 Bil’am was not as great a sorcerer as Balak. Balak divined that Bnei Yisroel would suffer a severe breach there, for Moshe died there. He thought that the curse would descend upon them from there, that this is the breach that I divine.<QC>
@p115@p2<EN>I will be called here by chance.@p3 By the Holy One, blessed is He. @d1I will be called by chance.@d2 This denotes the reflexive usage. @p116@p2<EN>And placed the word in his mouth.@p3 @rr°@bbWhat is this placing, and what would Scripture have been lacking if it had said, “return to Balak and say the following”? But when he heard that he was not permitted to curse, he said, “Why should I return to Balak merely to bring him grief”? So the Holy One, Blessed is He, placed a rein and a bit in his mouth, like a man who equips his animal with a bit to lead it wherever he wishes. @rr°@bbHe said to him, “You will be forced to return to Balak.”<QC>
@p117@p2<EN>Accompanied by the Moavite dignitaries.@p3 Above it states “and @ITall@it the Moavite dignitaries.” When they saw that it was hopeless, some departed, leaving only some others. @d1What did Adonoy say?@d2 @rr°@bbThis denotes derision, as if to say, “you are not your own master.” @p118@p2<EN>Arise, Balak.@p3 When he saw that he was ridiculing him, he intended to irritate him. “Stand on your feet! You are not permitted to remain seated while I serve as the Omnipresent’s emissary to you.” @d1Son of (lit. his son) Tzipor.@d2 This is a Scriptural usage, like “beasts (lit. his beasts) of the forest,” “beasts (lit. his beasts) of the earth,” “into a spring (lit. his spring) of water.” @p119@p2<EN>God is not like man, etc.@p3 He has already sworn to them to bring them and give them possession of the land of the seven nations, and you think that you can kill them in the wilderness? @d1Would He say, etc.@d2 @rr°@bbThe word denotes a question. Targum [Onkelos] translates “who retract and reconsider” — @rr°@bbthey retract, then reconsider whether to change their minds. @p120@p2<EN>Behold I was commanded to bless.@p3 You ask me, “what has God said”? @rr°@bbI have received [instructions] from Him to bless them. @d1[Bless.@d2 Similar “to bless.”] @d1[When] He has blessed, I cannot reverse it.@d2 He has blessed them, @rr°@bband I will not reverse his blessing. @d1He has blessed.@d2 As if it were @hh<HEB>וּבִרֵךְ@ee<ENG>. This is how the letter @hh<HEB>ר@ee<ENG> is conjugated, like @hh<HEB>אוֹיֵב חֵרֵף@ee<ENG>, as if it were @hh<HEB>חִרֵף@ee<ENG>. Similarly, @hh<HEB>וּבֹצֵעַ בֵּרֵךְ@ee<ENG> One who lauds and blesses the thief, saying “have no fear, you will not be punished, you will be at peace,” angers the Holy One, Blessed is He. But one cannot say that @hh<HEB>בֵּרֵךְ@ee<ENG> is a noun, for if so, it would be vocalized with a minor @ITpatach@it [@ITsegol,@it @hh<HEB>בֶּרֶךְ@ee<ENG>], with the accent above. However, because it connotes action, it is vocalized with a minor @ITkomatz@it [@ITtzayreh,@it @hh<HEB> בֵּרֵךְ@ee<ENG>], with the accent below. @p121@p2<EN>One does not see evildoers in Yaakov.@p3 As Targum [Onkelos] renders. Another interpretation: By following its plain meaning, it may be expounded beautifully. The Holy One, Blessed is He, does not look at the evil in Yaakov. When they transgress His commandments, He does not pursue them exactingly by reflecting on @rr°@bbthe wickedness and wrongdoing of their violation of His doctrines. @d1Transgression.@d2 The word [@hh<HEB>עמל@ee<ENG>, (lit. tediousness)] denotes sin, as in “sin conceives,” “for you observe sinful and infuriating behaviour.” Because sinfulness is tedious before the Omnipresent. @d1Adonoy, his God, is with him.@d2 Even when they anger Him and are rebellious, He does not leave them. @d1He has the King’s friendship.@d2 The word denotes affection and friendship, like “David’s comrade” — one who loves David, “and he gave it to his fellow.” Similarly, Onkelos renders “the King’s Presence is among them.” @p122@p2<EN>God Who has brought them out of Egypt.@p3 You said, “behold, a nation came out of Egypt” — they did not leave by themselves, God delivered them. @d1Has shown His great strength to them.@d2 @rr°@bbLike the power of His loftiness and elevation. Similarly, “and silver [shall be your] strength.” It denotes strength. Now I say that the word [@hh<HEB>תּוֹעֲפֹת@ee<ENG>] is from @hh<HEB>וְעוֹף יְעוֹפֵף@ee<ENG>. (“and let birds fly,”) someone who flies to a lofty elevation — @rr°@bbthis is a great application of power. @hh<HEB>וְתוֹעֲפֹת רְאֵם@ee<ENG>, lofty flight. Another interpretation [of] @hh<HEB>תוֹעֲפֹת רְאֵם@ee<ENG>, “the power of the @ITre’emim.@it” The Rabbis explain that @rr°@bbthis refers to the demons and evil spirits. @p123@p2<EN>For there is no sorcery in Yaakov.@p3 For they deserve to be blessed, since there are no sorcerers or magicians among them.<QC>
@d1In due time, it will be said to Yaakov, etc.@d2 There is destined @rr°@bbto be another time such as this, when their preciousness will be revealed before everyone’s eyes, @rr°@bbfor they will be seated before Him studying the Torah from His mouth, and their partition will be further within, than the administering angels, who will ask them, “What has God done”? This is [the meaning of] what is said, “your eyes shall behold your master.” Another interpretation: @hh<HEB>יֵאָמֵר לְיַעֲקֹב@ee<ENG> does not refer to the future, but to the present. They have no need for magicians and sorcerers, for at any time when it is necessary that Yaakov and Yisroel be told what the Holy One, Blessed is He, has done, and what He has decreed on high, they do not perform magic or sorcery. @rr°@bbRather, they are told through their prophets what the Omnipresent’s decree is, or, the @ITUrim@it and @ITTummim@it informs them. Onkelos, however, does not interpret this way.<QC>
@p124@p2<EN>Behold, a people that rises like a young lion, etc.@p3 When they rise from their slumber in the morning, they are as vigorous as the young lion and the lion, to snatch the @ITmitzvos@it wearing a @ITTallis,@it reading the @ITShema,@it and putting on the @ITTefillin.@it @d1He does not lie down.@d2 At night on his bed @rr°@bbuntil he consumes and destroys every harmful spirit which comes to attack him. How is this? He reads the bedtime @ITShema,@it and entrusts his soul in the hand of the Omnipresent. If a corps or army comes to attack them, the Holy One, Blessed is He, protects them — and fights their battles, and strikes them (the attackers) dead. Another interpretation of “behold, a people rises like a lion, etc.,” is as Targum [Onkelos] renders. @d1And drinks the blood of its kill.@d2 He prophesied that Moshe would not die @rr°@bbuntil he would strike the Midianite kings dead, and he (Bil’am) would be killed with them, as it is said, “and Bil’am the son of Beor, the sorcerer, the Bnei Yisroel killed by the sword, with the others whom they killed.” @p125@p2<EN>Also do not curse them.@p3 @rr°@bbThe first “also” is added to the second “also,” and the second “also” to the first “also.” Similarly, “also to me, also to you, let him not be.” Similarly, “also the youth, also the virgin.”<QC>
@p127@p2<EN>And you will curse them for me.@p3 @rr°@bbThis is not a command, like “curse them,” but the future tense. “Perhaps it will be proper in His eyes, and you will curse them for me, from there.” “@ITMalduras lui@it” (you will curse them), in Old French. @p128@p2<EN>To the peak of Pe’or.@p3 Balak was a great sorcerer, and he saw that they were destined to be smitten through Pe’or, but he didn’t know in what way. He said, “Perhaps the curse will descend on them from there.” @rr°@bbIt is similar with all the star gazers — they see, but do not know what they see.<QC>
@p11@p2<EN>Bil’am saw that it was favorable, etc.@p3 He said, “it is no longer necessary for me to test the Holy One, Blessed is He, for He will never want to curse them. @d1He did not approach, as at each time.@d2 As he had done twice. @d1Towards sorcery.@d2 To divine whether God would perhaps chance to appear to him as he wished. He said, “Whether or not He wants to curse them, @rr°@bbI will mention their sins, so that the curse will descend with the mention of their sins.” @d1He set his face toward the wilderness.@d2 @rr°@bbAs Targum [Onkelos] renders.<QC>
@p12@p2<EN>Bil’am raised his eyes.@p3 He strove @rr°@bbto induce the evil eye in them. Here you have his three characteristics, the evil eye, false vanity, and greed, as stated above. @d1Encamped according to its tribes.@d2 He saw each tribe dwelling by itself, without mingling. He saw that their entrances did not face each other, so that one should not look into his neighbor’s tent. @d1And the spirit of God rested upon him.@d2 @rr°@bbIt occurred to him not to curse them.<QC>
@p13@p2<EN>The son of (lit. his son was) Be’or.@p3 Like @hh<HEB>לְמַעְיְנוֹ מָיִם@hh@ee<ENG>, “into a spring of water.” @rr°@bbAccording to Midrash Aggadah: Both were greater than their forefathers; “Balak, his son Tzipor” — his father was his son in royalty, and Bil’am was greater than his father in prophecy, @rr°@bbhe was a coin, the son of half a coin. @d1Of the open-socketed eye.@d2 His eye had been put out and removed, and its socket appeared open. The word [@hh<HEB>שְׁתֻם@ee<ENG>] is in the Mishnah; @rr°@bb”enough for it to have been opened, sealed, and dried.” The Rabbis remark, because he said, “He counts the seed of Yisroel” — that the Holy One, Blessed is He, sits and counts the seed of the Israelites, awaiting the drop from which a saint will be born, he thought, “the One who is Holy, and whose ministering angels are holy, looks at these things”? For this, Bil’am’s eye was blinded. However, @rr°@bbsome interpret @hh<HEB>שְׁתֻם הָעָיִן@ee<ENG> as “of the open eye,” as Targum [Onkelos] renders. And since he said “of the open eye,” @rr°@bbbut did not say “of the open eyes,” we learn that he was blind in one of his eyes. @p14@p2<EN>Fallen, with opened eyes.@p3 The plain interpretation is like Targum [Onkelos], that He (God) did not reveal Himself to him except at night, when he was lying down. @rr°@bbAccording to Midrash, when He revealed Himself to him, he did not have the strength to stand on his feet, but fell to his face, because he was uncircumcised, and it was disgusting to be revealed to him when he stood upright before Him. @p15@p2<EN>How goodly are your tents.@p3 Because he saw that their entrances were not facing each other. @d1Your dwelling places.@d2 Your camps, as Targum [Onkelos] renders. Another interpretation of how goodly are your tents: How goodly is the tent of Shiloh and the Eternal Temple when they are inhabited, for sacrifices are offered in them to bring you forgiveness. @d1Your dwelling places.@d2 Even when they are desolate, since they are held as security for you, and their desolation brings atonement for your souls, as it is said, “Adonoy expended his fury” — and how did He expend it? “He ignited a fire in Tziyon.” @p16@p2<EN>They stretch forth like streams.@p3 Which extend and flow, stretching across the distance. The Rabbis remark, ‘from that wicked one’s blessings, we learn how he intended to curse them, when he decided to set his face towards the wilderness. When the Omnipresent overturned [the words of] his mouth, his blessings corresponded with his intended curses, etc.,’ as stated in “Chelek.” @d1Like the aloe trees.@d2 As Targum [Onkelos] renders, meaning the same as “myrrh and aloes.” @d1That Adonoy has planted.@d2 In the garden of Eden. Another interpretation of @hh<HEB>כַּאֲהָלִים נָטַע ה'@ee<ENG>, like the heavens stretched taut like a tent [as it is said, “He stretched them taut like a tent to be dwelt in”]. @d1That Adonoy has planted,@d2 The expression @hh<HEB>נְטִיעָה@ee<ENG> is found with relation to tents, as it is said, “he stretched taut his palatial tents.”<QC>
@p17@p2<EN>From his buckets.@p3 From his wells. The explanation is as Targum [Onkelos] interprets. @d1And his seed will have an abundant flow.@d2 This denotes success, like a seed planted near water. @d1His king will be greater than Agag.@d2 @rr°@bbTheir first king shall conquer Agag, king of Amalek. @d1And his monarchy shall be uplifted.@d2 Yaakov’s [monarchy] more and more, as he (Shaul) shall be followed by Dovid and Shlomo. @p18@p2<EN>God Who has brought him out of Egypt.@p3 Who gave them this eminence? God, who delivered them from Egypt @rr°@bbwith his power and exaltedness, shall consume the nations who oppress him. @d1Their bones.@d2 Of the oppressors. @d1He shall crush.@d2 Menachem interprets this as denoting breaking. Similarly, “[wolves in the evening] who did not break any bones in the morning.” Similarly, “you shall crush its earthen vessels.” I say that the meaning is “bone.” He strips the surrounding flesh with his teeth, and the marrow from inside, @rr°@bbleaving the bone exposed. @d1And dip His arrows [in their blood].@d2 Onkelos interprets “the oppressors’ half,” their portion, @rr°@bblike @hh<HEB>בַּעֲלֵי חִצִּים@ee<ENG>, [translated as] @hh<HEB>מָרֵי פַלְגּוּתָא@ee<ENG> (meaning portion, or half), @hh<HEB>יִמְחָץ@ee<ENG> is similar, meaning the same as “she split [his skull], passing through his forehead” — they shall apportion their land. Also, this may be interpreted as actually denoting arrows. The arrows of the Holy One, Blessed is He, will @hh<HEB>יִמְחַץ@ee<ENG> in the blood of the oppressors, He shall dip and stain with their blood, as in, “that your foot may wade through blood” This is not a departure from the connotation of “wound,” as in “I have wounded,” since someone stained with blood appears to have been injured and wounded.<QC>
@p19@p2<EN>He crouches and lies like a lion.@p3 As Targum [Onkelos] renders, they will settle in their land with strength and power. @p110@p2<EN>[He] clapped his hands.@p3 He struck one against the other. @p113@p2<EN>Transgress the word of Adonoy.@p3 Here “@ITmy@it” God is not stated, as it was originally, for he knew that he was loathed by the Holy One, Blessed is He, and that he had been repudiated.<QC>
@p114@p2<EN>Am returning to my people.@p3 I am now like the rest of my people — the Holy One, Blessed is He, had forsaken him. @d1Come, I will advise you.@d2 Concerning the action you should take. What was the advice? The God of these people hates promiscuity, etc., as stated in “Chelek.” The proof that Bil’am instigated his advice so that they would be ensnared into immorality is from Scripture’s declaration, “they were involved with the Israelites through Bil’am’s advice.” @d1What this people will do to your people.@d2 This is a shortened passage; I will advise you about ensnaring them, and I will tell you how they are destined to destroy Moav at the end of days — “and smash the great men of Moav.” Targum [Onkelos] explains where the Hebrew falls short. @p116@p2<EN>And knows the thoughts of the Most Exalted.@p3 To pinpoint the moment of His anger. @p117@p2<EN>I see it.@p3 I see the praise and greatness of Yaakov. Not, however, now, but at a later time. @d1A star has gone forth.@d2 As Targum [Onkelos] interprets. @hh<HEB>דָּרַךְ@ee<ENG> means the same as @hh<HEB>דָּרַךְ קַשְׁתּוֹ@ee<ENG>, “He hurled with His bow,” as a star travels like an arrow. In Old French, “@ITdestente@it” (“hurl”). As if to say, “a constellation shall rise.” @d1A staff has arisen.@d2 A king who subdues and rules. @d1Smash the corners of Moav.@d2 This refers to David, of whom it is said, “he laid them on the ground and measured two strings to kill, etc.” @d1And impale.@d2 The meaning is to penetrate, like, “I have excavated,” “the pit ax which quarried you” “let the ravens of the river gouge it.” “@ITForjier@it” (“pierce”), in Old French. @d1All of the sons of Sheis.@d2 All the nations, since they were all descended from Sheis, the son of Adam. @p118@p2<EN>Seir shall become the possession of his enemies.@p3 @rr°@bbHis enemies, the Bnei Yisroel. @p119@p2<EN>A ruler shall come from Yaakov.@p3 @rr°@bbYet another ruler shall come from Yaakov. @d1Who will annihilate the survivors of the city.@d2 Of the most prominent city of Edom, Rome. He said this concerning King Mashiach, of whom it is said, “he shall rule from sea to sea,” “there will be no survivors of the house of Eisav.” @p120@p2<EN>[Bil’am] Saw Amalek.@p3 @rr°@bbHe gazed at Amalek’s punishment. @d1Amalek was the first among nations.@d2 He preceded them all @rr°@bbin waging war against Israel. This, too, is Targum’s [Onkelos] interpretation. @d1And his end.@d2 @rr°@bbWill be to perish by their hand, as it is said, “you shall obliterate the memory of Amalek.” @p121@p2<EN>He saw the Keinite.@p3 Because the Keinite was encamped near Amalek, as in the incident of which it is said, “Shaul said to the Keinite, etc.,” he mentioned him after Amalek. He gazed at the greatness of Yisro’s descendants, of whom it is said, @rr°@bb”Tirasites, Shimasites, Sochasites.” @d1How powerful is your dwelling place.@d2 @rr°@bbI wonder how you merited this. Were you not with me in counseling “come, let us deal shrewdly with them”? Yet now you have settled yourself in the power and strength of Israel. @p122@p2<EN>For, if Kayin is to be uprooted, etc.@p3 How fortunate you are to be encamped in this stronghold, so that you will no longer be driven from the world. For, even if you are destined to be exiled with the ten tribes, and will be uprooted from the place where you settled, what of it? @d1Until where (lit. what) will Ashur take you captive.@d2 Until where will he exile you? @rr°@bbPerhaps to Chalach and Chavor? This is not considered being driven from the world, but being shifted from place to place, and you shall return with the other exiles. @p123@p2<EN>He set forth his parable, etc.@p3 Since he mentioned the captivity by Ashur, he said: Alas! who can survive from God’s devastation @rr°@bbWho is capable of self-survival against His putting these — so that He shall not put them [into effect] against him — He who decrees (God) — these? Sancheriv shall arise and commingle all the nations. Furthermore, Warships will come from Kittim — Kitites, meaning Romans, shall go forth in great ships against Ashur. @p124@p2<EN>And cause suffering to those at the other side.@p3 Shall cause suffering for those at the other side of the river. @d1They, too, shall be lost for eternity.@d2 @rr°@bbSimilarly, Doniel explains, “until the animal was killed, and its body destroyed.” @d1Warships.@d2 Great ships, as it is written, @hh<HEB>וְצִי אַדִּיר@ee<ENG>, rendered by Targum as “great ships.” @p11@p2<EN>In Shittim.@p3 @rr°@bbThis was its name.<QC>
@d1Acting promiscuously with the daughters of Moav.@d2 As a result of Bil’am’s advice, @rr°@bbas stated in “Chelek.” @p12@p2<EN>And prostrated themselves before their gods.@p3 @rr°@bbWhen he was overcome by lust, and asked her to submit to him, she drew a statue of Pe’or from her bosom toward him and said, ‘Prostrate yourself before this’! @p13@p2<EN>Pe’or.@p3 @rr°@bbBecause they bared, their buttocks before it and relieved themselves — this is the way it was worshipped.<QC>
@d1The rage of Adonoy flared against Yisroel.@d2 @rr°@bbHe sent a plague on them. @p14@p2<EN>Take all the leaders of the people.@p3 @rr°@bbTo pass judgement on those who worshipped Pe’or. @d1And hang them.@d2 The worshippers. @d1@hh<HEB>וְהוֹקַע@ee<ENG>.@d2 This refers to hanging, as we find concerning the sons of Shaul, “and let us hang them for [the sake of] God.” and there, hanging is specified, idolatry is [punished] with stoning, and @rr°@bball those stoned are hung. @d1Facing the sun.@d2 @rr°@bbIn full public view. Midrash Aggadah: The sun identifies the sinners. @rr°@bbThe cloud rolls back from the area above him, @rr°@bband the sun shines on him. @p15@p2<EN>Each of you must execute his men.@p3 Each of the Israelite judges executed two men, and there were eighty eight thousand Israelite judges, as stated in Sanhedrin. @p16@p2<EN>Behold, a man came from among Bnei Yisroel.@p3 @rr°@bbThe tribe of Shimon gathered around Zimri, who was their leader, and said to him, “We are being sentenced to death, and you sit by, etc.,” as stated in “Eilu Hein Hanisrafin.” @d1The Midianite woman.@d2 Kozbi, daughter of Tzur. @d1Before the eyes of Moshe.@d2 They said to him, “Moshe, is she forbidden or permitted? If you say ‘forbidden,’ @rr°@bbwho permitted the daughter of Yisro to you? etc.” as stated there. @d1Who were weeping.@d2 @rr°@bbThe @IThalachah@it was concealed from him [that anyone having relations with a gentile woman is to be executed by the zealous], so they all burst into tears. At the golden calf, Moshe stood against six hundred thousand, as it is said, “he ground it into powder, etc.,” yet here he was enfeebled? But this was in order that Pinchas might come and take what was appropriately his. @p17@p2<EN>Pinchas.<TIE>.<TIE>.saw.@p3 He saw the incident @rr°@bband remembered the @IThalachah.@it He said to Moshe, “I received from you [the teaching] that anyone having relations with a gentile woman is to be @rr°@bbexecuted by the zealous.” He replied to him, “Let the one who reads the correspondence serve as its executor.” Instantly, “he took a spear in his hand, etc.” @p18@p2<EN>@HB<HEB>אֶל הַקֻבָּה@ee<ENG>.@p3 Into the tent. @d1Through her belly.@d2 As in “the jaws and the uterus.” He struck precisely at Zimri’s male organ and her female organ, so everyone saw that he did not kill them needlessly. @rr°@bbMany miracles were performed for him, etc., as stated there.<QC>
@p111@p2<EN>Pinchas the son of Elozor, the son of Aharon the @BIkohein.@it @rr°@bbBecause the tri es disparaged him, [saying] ‘Have you seen that son of “Puti,” whose mother’s father fattened calves for idol worship, and @rr°@bbwho murdered the chieftain of a tribe of Israel?’ Therefore, Scripture traces his lineage to Aharon.<QC>
@d1By his vengeance for Me.@d2 @rr°@bbBy avenging My vengeance — by his rage where I should have been enraged. @hh<HEB>קִנְאָה@ee<ENG> always denotes someone @rr°@bbenflamed to avenge something. @ITEnportment,@it “flaming anger,” in Old French. @p112@p2<EN>My covenant [of] peace.@p3 @rr°@bbTo be a covenant of peace for him like a man who harbors @rr°@bbgratitude and favor towards someone who benefitted him. Here, too, the Holy One, Blessed is He, expressed to him His peace.<QC>
@p113@p2<EN>It shall be.@p3 To him — @rr°@bbthis covenant of Mine. @d1A covenant of eternal @BIkehunah@it.@d2 Although the @ITkehunah@it had already been given to Aharon’s descendants, it was given @rr°@bbsolely to Aharon and his sons who were annointed with him, and to their generations who would be borne after their annointment. Pinchas, however, who was born before, and was not annointed, was not included in the @ITkehunah@it until here. Similarly, we learned in Zevachim, ‘Pinchas was not rendered a @ITkohein@it until he killed Zimri.’ @d1For his God.@d2 For the sake of his God, like @hh<HEB>הַמְקַנֵּא אַתָּה לִי@ee<ENG>, “are you zealous ‘for’ me?” and @hh<HEB>קִנֵּאתִי לְצִיּוֹן@ee<ENG>, “for the sake of Tzion.”<QC>
@p114@p2<EN>The name of the Israelite man, etc.@p3 @rr°@bbWhere he mentions the relationship of the saint for praise he mentions the relationship of the wicked for shame. @d1Leader of a paternal house of Shimon.@d2 @rr°@bbOf one of the five paternal houses of the tribe of Shimon. @rr°@bbAnother interpretation: To proclaim the merit of Pinchas. Although this one was a leader, he did not refrain from avenging the desecration of the Name [of God]. This is why Scripture informs you of the identity of the one who was killed.<QC>
@p115@p2<EN>The name of the slain woman, etc.@p3 @rr°@bbTo inform you of the hatred of the Midianites, who abandoned a princess to promiscuous behavior in order to entice the Israelites into sinning.<QC>
@d1The national leader.@d2 @rr°@bbOne of the five kings of Midian, “Evi, Rekem, Tzur, etc.” He was the most prominent of all of them, as it is said, “the national leader,” @rr°@bbbut because he debased himself by abandoning his daughter, he is counted third. @d1Of a paternal house.@d2 There were five paternal houses in Midian, Eiphah, Eipher, Chanoch, Avidah, and Eldoah. This one was the king of one them. @p117@p2<EN>Antagonize.@p3 Like @hh<HEB>זָכוֹר@ee<ENG>, “remember,” @hh<HEB>שָׁמוֹר@ee<ENG> ,”keep,” meaning ongoing action. It is incumbent upon you to act with hostility toward them. @p118@p2<EN>For they antagonized you, etc., in the matter of Pe’or.@p3 Since they abandoned their daughters to promiscuity @rr°@bbin order to cause you to stray after Pe’or. @rr°@bbHowever, He did not order the destruction of Moav, Because of Rus [Ruth], who was destined to emanate from them, as we state in Bava Kama.<QC>
@p11@p2<EN>It was after the plague, etc.@p3 @rr°@bbThis is compared to a shepherd whose flock was infiltrated by wolves, who killed some of them. He counted them, to ascertain the number of those remaining. Another interpretation: When they left Egypt and were entrusted to Moshe, they were given to him with a reckoning; now that he neared death, and the return of his sheep, he returned them with a reckoning.<QC>
@p12@p2<EN>According to their paternal house.@p3 @rr°@bbTheir relationship follows the paternal tribe, rather than the maternal. @p13@p2<EN>Moshe and Elozor the @BIkohein@BO spoke with them.@p3 @rr°@bbThey spoke with them concerning this — that the Omnipresent had commanded to count them. @d1Saying.@d2 They said to them, @rr°@bb”You must be counted.” @p14@p2<EN>[Count those] twenty years of age and above, as [Adonoy] commanded, etc.@p3 That they be counted from the age of twenty and above, @rr°@bbas it is said, “everyone passing by to be counted, etc.”<QC>
@p15@p2<EN>The Chanochite family.@p3 Because the gentiles disparaged them, saying, ‘what, they trace their lineage to their tribes? They think that the Egyptians had no control over their mothers? If they ruled over their bodies, then certainly over their wives!’ Therefore, the Holy One, Blessed is He, attached His Name to them, @rr°@bbthe @hh<HEB>ה'@ee<ENG> on one side, and the @hh<HEB>י'@ee<ENG> on the other, to say, ‘I bear witness, concerning them, that they are the sons of their fathers.’ This is stated clearly by Dovid, “the tribes of God as a testimony to Israel.” This Name testifies for them concerning their tribes. Therefore, Scripture states, with all of them, @hh<HEB>הַחֲנוֹכִי@ee<ENG>, “the Chanochite,” @hh<HEB>הַפַּלּוּאִי@ee<ENG>, “the Paluite.” But with @hh<HEB>יִמְנָה@ee<ENG>, it was unnecessary to say @hh<HEB>מִשְׁפַּחַת הַיִּמְנִי@ee<ENG>, “the Yimnite family,” since the Name is fixed in it, the @hh<HEB>י'@ee<ENG> at the beginning and the @hh<HEB>ה'@ee<ENG> at the end. @p19@p2<EN>Who incited@p3 @rr°@bbIsrael @BOagainst Moshe. @d1When they incited.@d2 The people against God. @d1Incited.@d2 They misled the Israelites into quarreling with Moshe. This is the causative form. @p110@p2<EN>They became a symbol.@p3 @rr°@bbA symbol and a reminder, so that no outsider would ever again come forward to dispute the @ITkehunah@it. @p111@p2<EN>But the sons of Korach did not die.@p3 They were involved in the conspiracy at first, but during the dispute, @rr°@bbthey repented in their hearts. Therefore, @rr°@bban elevated area was secured for them in @ITgehinom,@it where they remained. @p113@p2<EN>From Zerach.@p3 This was Tzochar, meaning the same as “Tzohar,” illumination. @rr°@bbHowever, the family of Ohad became extinct. Also, five [families] of the tribe of Binyamin, as he had descended to Egypt with ten sons, yet here only five are counted. @rr°@bbAlso, Etzbon, of Gad — so there are seven families. I found, in the Talmud Yerushalmi, that when Aharon died the clouds of glory departed, and the Canaanites came to wage war against Israel. They (Bnei Yisroel) resolved to return to Egypt, and went back eight journeys, from Mount Hor to Moserah, as it is said, “Bnei Yisroel journeyed from Be’eros Bnei Yaakon to Moserah, where Aharon died.” Now did he not die at Mount Hor? @rr°@bbAnd from Moserah to Mount Hor there are eight journeys going back. But, they returned, and the Levites pursued them to bring them back, killing seven of their families. And four Levite families fell; The families of Shim’i and Uzieli. @rr°@bbOf the sons of Yitzhar, none are counted here, except for the Korachite family. @rr°@bbI do not know the identity of the fourth. R’ Tanchuma expounded, @rr°@bbthat they died in the plague at the affair of Bil’am — however, according to the loss suffered by the tribe of Shimon in this counting, @rr°@bbas compared with the first counting at the Sinai desert, it appears that all twenty four thousand @rr°@bbfell from the tribe of Shimon.<QC>
@p116@p2<EN>From Ozni.@p3 @rr°@bbI say that this was the family of Etzbon, but I do not know why his family was not called by his name.<QC>
@p124@p2<EN>From Yashuv.@p3 @rr°@bbThis is Yov, mentioned among those who went down to Egypt, as all of the families were called by the names of those who went down to Egypt. As for those who were born afterward, none of the families were called by their names, except for the families of Efrayim and Menashe, all of whom were born in Egypt, @rr°@bband Ard and Na’aman, the sons of Bela, the son of Binyamin. I found, in the commentary of R’ Moshe Hadarshan, @rr°@bbthat their mother went down to Egypt when she was pregnant with them, and @rr°@bbthey were, therefore, divided into separate families, like Chetzron and Chamul, who were Yehudah’s grandsons, and Chever and Malkiel, who were Asher’s grandsons. @rr°@bbIf this is from the Aggadah, fine, but if not, then I say that Bela had a great many grandchildren, and from those two, Ard and Na’aman, @rr°@bbrespectively, large families emanated. The descendants of the other children were called by Bela’s name, while the descendants of those two were called by their names. I say the same about the sons of Machir, who were divided into two families, one called by his name, and one called by the name of his son, Gil’ad. @rr°@bbFive families are missing from the sons of Binyamin. Here, his mother’s prophecy was partially fulfilled — she called him @hh<HEB>בֶּן אוֹנִי@ee<ENG>, “son of my sorrow.” With the concubine of Givah, it was completely fulfilled. I found this in the commentary of R’ Moshe Hadarshan.<QC>
@p136@p2<EN>These are the sons of Shuselach, etc.@p3 The descendants of @rr°@bbthe other sons of Shuselach were called by the name Shuselach, but from Eiran a large family emanated, so it was called by his name. Thus, the sons of Shuselach were considered two families. Go and calculate, and you will discover, in this chapter, fifty seven families, and eight from the sons of Levi — hence, sixty five. This is [the meaning of] what is said, @hh<HEB>כִּי אַתֶּם "הַמְעַט" וְגוֹ'@ee<ENG>, “for you are the least, etc. “ @hh<HEB>הֵ"א מְעַט@ee<ENG>, “five less.” You are five less than all the gentile families, as they are seventy. This, too, I understood from the commentary of R’ Moshe Hadarshan, but I had to subtract and add to his words.<QC>
@p138@p2<EN>From Achiram.@p3 This is Eichi, who went down to Egypt. Because he was named to commemorate Yoseif, who was his brother and was exalted over him, he was called Achiram. @p139@p2<EN>From Shfufam.@p3 This is Mupim, to commemorate Yosef’s @rr°@bbbeing humbled among the nations.<QC>
@p142@p2<EN>From Shucham.@p3 This is Chushim. @p146@p2<EN>The name of Asher’s daughter was Serach.@p3 Because she remained alive, he counted her here.<QC>
@p153@p2<EN>The land shall be apportioned among these.@p3 But not among those below the age of twenty, @rr°@bbeven if they reach twenty before the apportioning of the land. Indeed, the conquest lasted seven years, and the apportioning seven, yet no one received a portion in the land except for these six hundred and one thousand. If one of them had six sons, they received nothing but their father’s portion. @p154@p2<EN>To the large [tribe], increase their inheritance.@p3 To the tribe with the greater populace, @rr°@bbthey gave a larger portion. Although the portions were unequal, as everything was assigned according to the size of the tribe, they implemented the apportioning solely by lots, and the lottery was inspired by the Sacred Spirit, as stated explicitly in Bava Basra. Elozor the @ITkohein@it was clothed in the @ITUrim veTumim,@it and said, with the Sacred Spirit, “If tribe so-and-so is drawn, then border so-and-so will be drawn with it.” The [names of the] tribes were written on twelve notes, and the twelve boundaries on twelve notes. They were mixed into a container, and the leader placed his hand into it and removed two notes. There appeared, in his hand, the note with the name of his tribe, and the note with the boundary specified for it. The lot itself would cry out, exclaiming, “I am the lot drawn for the so-and-so boundary, belonging to tribe so-and-so,” as it is said, “by word of the lottery.” The land was not apportioned dimensionally, since some boundaries were superior to others, but by assessed value. A poor @ITKor@it area was equivalent to a superior @ITSeah@it area, all according to the value [of the soil.]<QC>
@p155@p2<EN>According to the names of their fathers’ tribes.@p3 This refers to those who left Egypt. @rr°@bbScripture deviates, with this inheritance, from all the others in the Torah. With every inheritance, the living inherit the dead, @rr°@bbbut here, the dead inherit the living. How is this? Two brothers among those who left Egypt @rr°@bbhad sons who entered the land, one had one son, the other, three. The single son received one portion, the three, three portions, as it is said, “the land shall be apportioned to these.” Their inheritance reverted @rr°@bbto their grandfather, and they then shared everything equally. This is [the meaning of] what is said, “according to the names of their fathers’ tribes, they shall inherit” — after the sons received it, they reapportioned it according to the fathers who left Egypt. But if they had apportioned it originally among those numbered in the exodus from Egypt, the four would have received only two portions, whereas they now received four portions. @d1Only by lot.@d2 @rr°@bbThis excludes Yehoshua and Kalev. And similarly it says, “they presented Kalev with Chevron, as Moshe had said.” And it says, “by the word of God they gave him the city which he requested.” @d1Of their fathers’ tribes.@d2 This excludes proselytes and [gentile] slaves. @p156@p2<EN>By word of the lottery.@p3 @rr°@bbThe lots spoke, as I explained above. This informs us that it was apportioned by the inspiration of the Sacred Spirit. This is why it is said, “By the word of God.” @p158@p2<EN>These are the families of Levi.@p3 There are missing, here, the families of Shim’i and Ozieili, and part of Yitzhari.<QC>
@p159@p2<EN>Whom [her mother] bore to Levi in Egypt.@p3 @rr°@bbHer birth was in Egypt, but she was not conceived in Egypt. As they were entering the wall, she bore her, and she completed the total of seventy. For, in enumeration, you will only find sixty-nine.<QC>
@p162@p2<EN>They were not counted among Bnei Yisroel.@p3 @rr°@bbTo have been counted from the age of twenty. What’s the reason? @rr°@bbSince no inheritance was given to them. Whereas those who were counted from the age of twenty were qualified to receive the inheritance, as it is said, “each person, according to his number, shall be given his inheritance.”<QC>
@p164@p2<EN>Among this [census] there was no man, etc.@p3 @rr°@bbHowever, against the women, the decree of the spies was not issued, since they cherished the land. The men said, “let us appoint a leader and we will return to Egypt”! @rr°@bbwhile the women said, “give us possession”! This is why the chapter of the daughters of Tzelofchad is adjacent here.<QC>
@p11@p2<EN>Of the families of Menashe the son of Yoseif.@p3 Why is this said? Has it not already said “the son of Menashe”? But it teaches you: Yoseif cherished the land, as it is said: “You must carry up my bones up, etc.,” and his daughters cherished the land, as it is said: “Give us possession,”! And @rr°@bbto teach you, that they were all righteous. For where someone’s deeds, and the deeds of his forefathers, are not defined, and Scripture specifically relates one of them to a virtuous ancestor, then this is a righteous person, the son of a righteous person. If he is related disparagingly, as, for example, “Yishmael, the son of Nesanyah, the son of Elishama,” then it is known that everyone mentioned with him was villainous. @d1Machlah, No’ah, etc.@d2 Below it says, “Machlah and Sirtzah were.<TIE>.<TIE>.” This teaches that they were all equal — the order was, therefore, changed. @p12@p2<EN>Before Moshe and before Elozor.@p3 This teaches that they only stood before them in the fortieth year, after Aharon had died. @d1Before Moshe.@d2 And afterward before Elozor? Is it possible that Moshe did not know and that Elozor did know? @rr°@bbBut, rearrange the passage and expound upon it. This is R’ Yoshiyah’s interpretation. Aba Chanan said in the name of R’ Elozor: “They were seated in the study hall, and they stood before all of them.” @p13@p2<EN>But he was not, etc.@p3 Since they were going to say that he died because of his sin, they needed to say, ‘not the sin of the complainers, nor with Korach's assembly, who incited [the people] against the Holy One, Blessed is He — was he. Rather, @rr°@bbhe died by his sin alone, without provoking others to sin with him.’ R’ Akiva said, @rr°@bb”He was the wood gatherer,” R’ Shimon said, “He was @rr°@bbamong those who ascended defiantly.” @p14@p2<EN>Why should the name of our father be omitted.@p3 We are substitutes for a son. And if females are not considered issue, then let our mother perform levirate marriage with her brother-in-law. @d1Because he did not have a son.@d2 @rr°@bbBut if he had a son, they would not have entered a claim. This teaches @rr°@bbthat they were learned. @p15@p2<EN>Moshe brought their case.@d2 @rr°@bbThe halachah was concealed from him. Here he was punished for assuming the crown by saying, “Matters too difficult for you, you may bring before me.” @rr°@bbAnother interpretation: It was fitting that this chapter be written through Moshe, but the daughters of Tzelofchad were meritorious, and it was written through them.<QC>
@p17@p2<EN>Tzelofchad’s daughters speak justly.@p3 @rr°@bbAs Targum renders, @hh<HEB>יָאוּת@ee<ENG>, “correctly.” This chapter is just so inscribed before Me on high. This teaches that their eye discerned what Moshe’s did not. @d1Tzelofchad’s daughters speak justly.@d2 Their claim was proper. Fortunate is the person with whom the Holy One, Blessed is He, concurs with his words. @d1Give [lit. Give, you shall give].@d2 @rr°@bbTwo portions. The portion of their father, who was among those who left Egypt, and his portion with his brothers, in the property of Cheifer. @d1Transfer.@d2 The word @hh<HEB>הַעֲבַרְתָּ@ee<ENG> @rr°@bbdenotes transference (anger), when someone does not leave a son to inherit him. Another interpretation: Because a daughter transfers the inheritance from tribe to tribe, as her son or husband inherit her. The prohibition against transferring an inheritance was placed @rr°@bbonly on that generation. Similarly, “his hereditary property shall be transferred to his daughter.” With all of them, it says “give,” but with the daughter, it says “transfer.” @p111@p2<EN>The the relative closest to him in his family.@p3 @rr°@bbNothing constitutes family except from the father’s side.<QC>
@p112@p2<EN>Go up this Avarim Mountain.@p3 @rr°@bbWhy is this placed here? When the Holy One, Blessed is He, said [to Moshe], “give them.<TIE>.<TIE>.,” he said, ‘God commanded me to give them the hereditary property. Perhaps the decree was abrogated, and I may enter the land.’ The Holy One, Blessed is He, said to him, “My decree remains in place.” @rr°@bbAnother interpretation: When Moshe entered the inheritance given to the sons of Gad and Reuven, he rejoiced, and said, ‘It seems that the vow regarding me was abrogated.’ This is comparable to a king who decreed that his son could not enter the doorway to his palace. He [the King] entered the gateway, and he [the son] followed, [he entered] the courtyard, and he followed, [he entered] the anteroom, and he followed. When he was about to enter @rr°@bbthe chamber, he [the king] said to him, ‘My son, from here and onward, you are forbidden to enter.’<QC>
@p113@p2<EN>As your brother Aharon was gathered.@p3 @rr°@bbFrom here we derive that Moshe yearned for a death such as Aharon’s. @rr°@bbAnother interpretation: You are no better than he. “Because you did not sanctify.<TIE>.<TIE>.” But if you had sanctified Me, @rr°@bbyour time would not yet have arrived, for passing from the world. Wherever their death is mentioned, their iniquity is mentioned, because it was decreed that the generation of the wilderness would die in the wilderness, for their sin of not having faith. Moshe, therefore, requested that his iniquity be mentioned, so that it would not be said that he, too, was among those who rebelled. This is comparable to two women who were punished by the court,<FJ> @rr°@bbone for degenerate behavior, @rr°@bbthe other for eating unripened Shmittah produce, etc. Here, too, wherever their death is mentioned, their iniquity is mentioned, to make it known that there was nothing [sinful] about them but this. @p114@p2<EN>Those were the waters of dispute at Kadeish.@p3 Those alone — @rr°@bbthey had no other sins. Another interpretation: Those of @rr°@bbthe rebellion at Marah were the same as those of the rebellion at the Reed Sea, and the very same as those of the rebellion at the desert of Tzin.<QC>
@p115@p2<EN>Moshe spoke to Adonoy, etc.@p3 @rr°@bbTo make the virtue of the righteous known — when they pass from the world, they ignore their own needs, and concern themselves with the needs of the community. @d1Saying.@d2 He said to Him, @rr°@bb‘answer me. Will You appoint a leader over them or not.’ @p116@p2<EN>Let Adonoy .<TIE>.<TIE>. appoint.@d2 When Moshe heard the Omnipresent say to him, ‘give Tzelofchad’s inheritance to his daughters,’ @rr°@bbhe said, ‘The time has come for me to ask for a personal request — that my sons may inherit my position of leadership.’ The Holy One, Blessed is He said to him, ‘That is not My intention. Yehoshua is worthy of being rewarded for his service, @rr°@bbas he never moved from the tent. This is [the meaning of] Shlomo’s statement, “he who keeps watch over the fig tree shall eat its fruit.” @d1God of the spirits.@d2 @rr°@bbWhy was this said? He said before Him: “Master of the universe, the thought of every individual is known before you, each dissimilar to the other’s. Appoint a leader over them who will exercise forbearance with each of them according to his intellect.” @p117@p2<EN>Who will go forth before them.@p3 Unlike the approach of the gentile kings, who stay at home and dispatch their armies to war. Rather, as I did, when I battled Sichon and Og, as it is said, “do not fear him,” and the way Yehoshua acted, as it is said, “Yehoshua went to him and said to him, ‘are you ours, etc.”’ Similarly, with David, it says, “for he goes forth and comes before them.” He goes forth at their head, and enters at their head. @d1Who will lead them out.@d2 With his merit. @d1And bring them in.@d2 With his merit. @rr°@bbAnother interpretation of “and bring them in”: That You will not treat him the way You treat me — for I will not bring them into the land. @p118@p2<EN>Take to yourself.@p3 @rr°@bbTake him with words of persuasion — you are fortunate to merit leading the children of the Omnipresent. @d1Yourself.@d2 @rr°@bbSomeone scrutinized by you, one whom you recognize.<QC>
@d1In whom there is spirit.@d2 @rr°@bbAs you requested, capable of accommodating everyone’s spirit. @d1And lay your hand on him.@d2 @rr°@bbProvide a public announcer for him in order @rr°@bbthat he might preach during your lifetime, so that it should not be said of him that he was unable to lift his head in Moshe’s day.<QC>
@p119@p2<EN>And command him.@p3 Concerning the Bnei Yisroel. Know that they are tedious and recalcitrant — [your appointment is] on condition that you accept this. @p120@p2<EN>Bestow some of your radiance on him.@p3 This refers to radiance of the facial skin. @d1Some of your radiance.@d2 But not all your radiance. Hence we learn that @rr°@bbthe face of Moshe was like the sun, the face of Yehoshua like the moon. @d1So that the entire community of Bnei Yisroel will hear.@d2 @rr°@bbThey will treat him with reverence and awe, the way they treat you.<QC>
@p121@p2<EN>He shall stand before Elozor the @ITkohein.@it@p3 @rr°@bbHere is [the reply to] your request — this glory will not be removed from your father’s house, as Yehoshua, too, will depend on the affirmation of Elozor. @d1And ask, of him.@d2 When he needs to go to war. @d1By his word.@d2 [the word] of Elozor. @d1And the entire community.@d2 @rr°@bbThe Sanhedrin. @p122@p2<EN>He took Yehoshua.@p3 @rr°@bbHe persuaded him, verbally, informing him of the reward for the leaders of Klal Yisroel in the World to Come.<QC>
@p123@p2<EN>He laid his hands.@p3 @rr°@bbGenerously, over and above what he had been commanded. For the Holy One, Blessed is He, said to him, “lay your hand,” but he used both hands. He fashioned him like a vessel filled to overflowing, filling him generously with his wisdom. @d1As Adonoy had commanded.@d2 also regarding the radiance — He bestowed some of his radiance on him. @p12@p2<EN>Command Bnei Yisroel.@p3 What is stated above? @rr°@bb”May God command.<TIE>.<TIE>.” The Holy One, Blessed is He, said to him, @rr°@bb‘Before you command Me concerning My children, command My children concerning Me.’ This is comparable to a princess who was passing from the world. She instructed her husband concerning her children, etc., as is stated in Sifri. @d1My offering.@d2 @rr°@bbThis refers to the blood. @d1My bread.@d2 @rr°@bbThis refers to the “@ITemurin@it” parts, as it is said, “The @ITkohein@it shall burn them on the altar, bread of the fire.” @d1Of My fires.@d2 to be placed on the fires of My altar. @d1You shall be vigilant.@d2 The @ITkohanim,@it Levites and Bnei Yisroel shall stand over it. @rr°@bbThey learned from here, and instituted the “@ITma’amados@it” units. @d1At its prescribed time.@d2 @rr°@bbEvery day is the time prescribed for the constant-offerings. @p13@p2<EN>Say to them.@p3 @rr°@bbThis is an admonishment to the @ITBais Din@it. @d1Two each day.@d2 @rr°@bbLike the plain interpretation, but essentially, it teaches @rr°@bbthat they should be slaughtered towards the sun, the constant morning sacrifice to the west, and that of the afternoon @rr°@bbto the east of the rings. @p14@p2<EN>One lamb.@p3 Although it is already stated in the @ITparasha@it of “You shall command” — “this is what you shall offer,” — those instructions were for the days of inauguration, whereas @rr°@bbhere, the commandment is for all the generations. @p15@p2<EN>Fine flour as a meal-offering.@p3 @rr°@bbThe libation @ITminchah.@it @p16@p2<EN>As offered on Mount Sinai.@p3 @rr°@bbLike those which were done during the days of inauguration. Another interpretation [of] which was done at Mount Sinai: The constant burnt-offering is compared to the burnt-offering at Mount Sinai — the one brought before the giving of the Torah — of which Scripture states “.<TIE>.<TIE>.and [he] placed it in the basins.” This teaches that it (the constant-offering) requires a vessel. @p17@p2<EN>Its libation.@p3 @rr°@bbWine. @d1In the Holy [Sanctuary], you shall pour.@d2 @rr°@bbThey shall be poured on the altar. @d1An intoxicating libation.@d2 Intoxicating wine. This excludes wine, fresh from the wine press. @p18@p2<EN>A pleasing aroma.@p3 It pleases Me that I spoke and My wish was fulfilled. @p110@p2<EN>This is the burnt-offering on its Shabbos.@p3 @rr°@bbBut not one Shabbos burnt-offering on another Shabbos. Suppose it was not offered on this Shabbos, I might think that two should be offered on the following Shabbos. The Torah therefore teaches “on its Shabbos.” This informs us that once its day has passed, the offering expires. @d1In addition to the constant (daily) burnt-offering.@d2 This refers to the @ITmusaf@it sacrifices, aside from the two constant burnt-offering lambs. This teaches that they (the @ITmusaf@it sacrifices) may be brought only @rr°@bbbetween the two constant-offerings. Similarly, concerning all the @ITmusaf@it sacrifices it is said, “in addition to the constant burnt-offering,” for this teaching.<QC>
@p112@p2<EN>Three tenths [of an @ITeiphah@it].@p3 As specified for the libations of a bull, @rr°@bbdesignated as such in the chapter of the libations. @p114@p2<EN>This is the burnt-offering of each [Rosh] Chodesh, at its renewal.@p3 But once its designated day has passed, the offering expires, with no provision for restitution.<QC>
@p115@p2<EN>And one he-goat, etc.@p3 @rr°@bbAll the @ITmusaf@it goats came in atonement for @rr°@bbthe ritual defilement of the Sanctuary and its sacred objects, everything as explained in Tractate Shevuos. There is a distinction with the New Moon goat, for it is said, concerning it, “.<TIE>.<TIE>.to God.” This teaches you that it atones for someone @rr°@bbwho was not cognizant either at the beginning or the end, as no one recognizes the transgression save for the Holy One, Blessed is He, alone. @rr°@bbThe other goats are derived from this one. @rr°@bbThis is also expounded @ITaggadically@it [as follows]: The Holy One, Blessed is He, said: ‘Bring atonement for Me, because I diminished the moon.’ @d1In addition to the constant (daily) burnt-offering, it shall be done.@d2 @rr°@bbThis entire offering.<QC>
@d1And its libation.@d2 @rr°@bb”Its libation” does not relate to the goat, as a sin-offering has no libation. @p118@p2<EN>Any work of consequence.@p3 Even work necessary for you, @rr°@bbfor example, to prevent a loss, which is permitted during the intermediary holiday, is prohibited during the festival. @p119@p2<EN>Bulls.@p3 Corresponding with Avraham, as it is said, “Avraham ran to the cattle.” @d1Ram.@d2 Corresponding with the ram of Yitzchok. @d1Sheep.@d2 Corresponding with Yaakov, as it is said, “Yaakov separated the lambs.” I saw this in R’ Moshe Hadarshan’s commentary. @p124@p2<EN>Like these, yoshall make daily.@p3 They should not be progressively decreasing like the oxen of the [@ITSuccos@it] festival. @p126@p2<EN>On the day of the first fruits.@p3 The Shavuos festival is called “[The festival of] the first fruits of the wheat harvest,” because of the offering of the two loaves, @rr°@bbwhich are the first of the wheat @ITminchah@it-offerings to come from the new crop.<QC>
@p131@p2<EN>[The sacrifices] shall be without blemish — and their libations.@p3 The libations must also be unblemished. @rr°@bbThe Rabbis derive from this that wine in which floury decay globules have surfaced is disqualified for libations.<QC>
@p16@p2<EN>Aside from the [Rosh] Chodesh burnt-<FJ> offering. @p3 The [Rosh] Chodesh @ITMusaf@it-<FJ> offerings, as it (the new moon) corresponds with the new year.<QC>
@p111@p2<EN>Aside from the atonement sin-offering.@p3 The goat offered in the inner chamber, mentioned in “Acharei Mos.” It, too, was a sin-<FJ> offering. @d1And the constant (daily)  burnt-<FJ> offering@d2 And @rr°@bbaside from the constant burnt-<FJ> offering, you shall offer these burnt-offerings. @d1And their libations.@d2 @rr°@bbThis relates to the @ITmusaf@it-offerings stated above, and to “you shall offer.” @rr°@bbIt denotes a command: ‘Aside from the constant burnt-offering and its @ITminchah,@it you shall offer these and their libations.’ It is the same with every “their libations” said at all the festivals, except those concerning the [@ITSuccos@it] holiday sacrifices. Every “and its libation,” “and their libations,” “and its libations” among them refer to the constant sacrifice, and are not commands, since the @ITmusaf@it libations are written separately for each day.<QC>
@p118@p2<EN>Their meal-offerings and their libations for the bulls.@p3 There were seventy festival bulls, representing the seventy nations, which were progressively diminishing, symbolizing their destruction. During the time of the Sanctuary, [however,] These sacrifices shielded them from suffering. @d1And the lambs.@d2 Representing Israel, which is called “the dispersed lamb.” Their numbers are constant, and they total ninety eight, to nullify the ninety eight curses in Mishneh Torah. On the second day, @hh<HEB>וְנִסְכֵּיהֶם@ee<ENG>, “and their libations,” is said, in relation to the day’s two constant-offerings. The change in language was intended for exposition, as the Rabbis, of blessed memory, remarked: On the second day, @hh<HEB>וְנִסְכֵּיהֶם@ee<ENG>, “and their libations,” is said, on the sixth, @hh<HEB>וּנְסָכֶיהָ@ee<ENG>, “and her libations,” on the seventh, @hh<HEB>כְּמִשְׁפָּטָם@ee<ENG>, “according to ‘their’ requirement.” @hh<HEB>מ"ם, יו"ד, מ"ם@ee<ENG>. which spells @hh<HEB>מַּיִם@ee<ENG>, “water,” and is an allusion that the water libation, during the Festival is Scriptural.<QC>
@p135@p2<EN>Shall be a [day of] restraint for you.@p3 @rr°@bbRestraint from doing work. @rr°@bbAnother interpetation [of] restraint, restrain yourselves from leaving. This teaches that they were required to remain overnight. @rr°@bbAccording to the Aggadic Midrash, because, throughout the entire holiday, they brought offerings which represented the seventy nations. When they were going to leave, the Omnipresent said to them, ‘I request of you, make a small repast for me, so that I may enjoy your company.’<QC>
@p136@p2<EN>One young bull, one ram.@p3 These @rr°@bbrepresent Yisroel [which is singular to the Holy One, Blessed is He] — ‘Remain with Me a little longer’. This denotes affection, as when children take leave of their father, and he says to them, ‘Your departure distresses me, remain yet another day’. This is compared to a king who made a repast, etc., as stated in tractate Succah. Midrash R’ Tanchumah interprets: The Torah teaches @rr°@bbproper conduct. Someone who entertains a guest should, on the first day, feed him fattened fowl, the next day fish, the next beef, the next day he should feed him grains, and the next, vegetables. Progressive diminishment, like the festival bulls. @p139@p2<EN>These you shall make to Adonoy on your festivals.@p3 Those things designated @rr°@bbas obligations. @d1Aside from your vows.@d2 If you should decide to vow offerings during the holiday, this will be credited to you as a commendable act. Or, the vows and gifts which you pledged throughout the year, bring during the holiday, as it may be difficult for you to make the return pilgrimage to Jerusalem to offer up your pledges, and you may thus ultimately violate the prohibition of “.<TIE>.<TIE>.do not delay [fulfilling your pledge].” @p11@p2<EN>Moshe spoke to Bnei Yisroel.@p3 This concludes the subject, comments R’ Yishmael. @rr°@bbBecause, up until this point, we have the words of the Omnipresent, and the chapter of vows begins with the words of Moshe, it is necessary to conclude the subject by saying that Moshe reviewed this @ITparshah@it with the Israelites. Otherwise, the implication would be that he (Moshe) did not tell them this, but began his discourse with the chapter of vows.<QC>
@p12@p2<EN>The tribal leaders.@p3 He bestowed honor on the leaders @rr°@bbby teaching them first, and afterward, all of Bnei Yisroel. How do we know that the other discourses were so? The Torah therefore teaches, “.<TIE>.<TIE>. they returned to him— Aharon and all the leaders of the congregation— and Moshe spoke to them. Afterward, all of Bnei Yisroel approached.” @rr°@bbWhy, then, did he see fit to say this here? He taught that @rr°@bbvows may be nullified by a single expert. When there is no single expert, nullification is @rr°@bbby three laymen. But perhaps Moshe recited this chapter @rr°@bbonly to the leaders? “This is the word” is said here, and it is said concerning slaughtering outside [the Temple], “this is the word.” Just as that was said to Aharon and his sons, and all of Bnei Yisroel, as it is said, “speak to Aharon, etc.,” so was this, said to all of them. @d1This is the word.@d2 @rr°@bbMoshe prophesied with “this is what Adonoy has said, about the time of midnight.<TIE>.<TIE>.,” and the [other] prophets prophesied with “this is what Adonoy has said:” Moshe surpassed them, as he prophesied @rr°@bbwith the phrase “this is the word.” @rr°@bbAnother interpretation: “This is the word” is exclusionary, teaching that @rr°@bbthe Sage [annuls] with the term “release,” and the husband with the term “nullification,” @rr°@bbfollowing the Scriptural language here. If they reverse the terminology, there is neither release nor nullification. @p13@p2<EN>A vow.@p3 By saying, ‘Let it be as @rr°@bba @ITkonam@it to me, that I will not eat, or I may not do a certain thing.’ But perhaps, even if he swears to eat the meat of an animal that was not ritually slaughtered, I read, concerning him, “all that he has verbalized, he must fulfill”? The Torah, therefore, teaches, “.<TIE>.<TIE>.to initiate a prohibition”— to prohibit what is permitted, but not to permit what is prohibited. @d1He may not profane his word.@d2 @rr°@bbLike @hh<HEB>Gא יְחַלֵּל דְבָרוֹ@ee<ENG>, he may not secularize his word. @p14@p2<EN>In her father’s home.@p3 @rr°@bbUnder her father’s jurisdiction, even if she is not actually in his home. @d1While still in her youth.@d2 @rr°@bbBut not a minor, or a “@ITbogeres,@it” as a minor’s vows are invalid, and a @ITbogeres@it is no longer under her father’s jurisdiction for nullification of vows. When is she considered a minor? Our Rabbis say, at the age of eleven and a day, her vows should be examined. If she recognizes in Who’s Name she took the vow, or in Who’s Name she made the sanctification, then her vow is valid. At the age of twelve and a day, examination is no longer required. @p16@p2<EN>But if her father restrained her.@p3 He restrained her from the vow, in other words, he nullified it. @rr°@bbI would not know what this @hh<HEB>הֲנָאָה@ee<ENG> means, but when it says, “but if, on the day her husband hears about it, @hh<HEB>יָנִיא אוֹתָהּ וְהֵפֵר@ee<ENG>, he restrains her and nullifies,” you may conclude that @hh<HEB>הֲנָאָה@ee<ENG> means nullification. Its plain meaning is to restrain and turn aside. Similarly, “why do you turn [the people’s hearts] away,” and “let the oil on my head not turn my head,” and “you will know My turning aside” [i.e. the punishment] for turning away from Me.”<QC>
@d1Adonoy will forgive her.@d2 To whom does Scripture refer? To a woman who took the Nazirite vow. Her husband heard and nullified it, but she was not aware. She then violated her vow by drinking wine and defiling herself by contact with a corpse. She is in need of forgiveness, although it was nullified. Now, if those who[se vows] have been nullified require forgiveness, certainly those who[se vows] have not been nullified.<QC>
@p17@p2<EN>If she is [married] to a man.@p3 This refers to an “@ITarusah.@it” @rr°@bbBut perhaps to a “@ITnesuah?@it” When it says, “and if she took the vow in her husband’s home,” a “@ITnesuah@it” is mentioned, @rr°@bbso this must mean an “@ITarusah.@it” It is intended to distinguish her, in @rr°@bbthat her father and her husband annul her vow. If the father annulled, but not the husband, or the husband, but not the father, there is no annulment, and it goes without saying, @rr°@bbif one of them endorsed it. @d1And her vows were upon herself.@d2 She took the vows in her father’s home, @rr°@bbbut her father did not hear them — they were neither annulled @rr°@bbnor endorsed. @p18@p2<EN>And her husband heard, etc.@p3 Here you have [the ruling] that if the husband endorses, it stands. @p19@p2<EN>He then annuls her vow which was upon her.@p3 @rr°@bbPerhaps even if the father did not annul? The Torah therefore teaches, “in her youth, while in her father’s house” — @rr°@bball through her youth, she is under her father’s jurisdiction. @p110@p2<EN>Everything she prohibited for herself shall remain incumbent upon her.@p3 Since she is neither under the jurisdiction of the father, nor the jurisdiction of the husband. Scripture refers here to @rr°@bba widow after “@ITnisuin,@it” but a widow after “@ITerusin,@it” when the husband dies, his jurisdiction transfers to the father. @p111@p2<EN>But if she took the vow in her husband’s home.@p3 @rr°@bbScripture refers to a “@ITnesuah.@it” @p114@p2<EN>Every vow, and every oath of self-denial, etc.@p3 Since it was said that the husband may annul, perhaps all vows are included; the Torah therefore teaches, “of self-denial.” @rr°@bbHe may only annul vows which are of self-denial They are defined in tractate Nedarim. @p115@p2<EN>From one day to the next.@p3 @rr°@bbSo that you should not say [he may annul] for twenty four hours — this is why “from day to day” is said, to teach that he may only annul @rr°@bbuntil nightfall. @p116@p2<EN>After having heard.@p3 After he heard and endorsed, @rr°@bbsaying, “I approve,” he recanted and annuled it, even during the same day. @d1He must bear her transgression.@d2 He must take her place. We learn from here that one who causes another’s downfall, must bear full punishment in his place.<QC>
@p12@p2<EN>Against the Midianites.@p3 @rr°@bbBut not against the Moavites, for the Moavites entered the matter out of fear. They were afraid of them, [fearing] that they would plunder them, as it only says, “do not provoke them with warfare.”  The Midianites, however, were @rr°@bbenraged over a dispute which was not theirs. Another interpretation: @rr°@bbfor the sake of two virtuous doves whom I must extract from them — Rus the Moavite, and Na’amah the Ammonite.<QC>
 @p13@p2<EN>Moshe spoke, etc.@p3 @rr°@bbAlthough he heard that his demise depended on the matter, he joyfully implemented it, without delay. @d1Arm.@d2 As Targum [Onkelos] renders, meaning the same as @hh<HEB>חֲלוּצֵי צָבָא@ee<ENG>, “armed.” @d1Men.@d2 @rr°@bbRighteous men. Similarly, “choose men for us,” and, “men who are wise and renowned.” @d1Revenge of Adonoy.@d2 For, when anyone stands against Yisroel, @rr°@bbit is as if he stands against the Holy One, Blessed is He. @p14@p2<EN>For all of the tribes of Yisroel.@p3 @rr°@bbThis includes the tribe of Levi. @p15@p2<EN>They were handed over.@p3 This informs you of the praiseworthiness of the shepherds of Yisroel, of how cherished they are by Yisroel. Before they heard about his death, what did he say? “a while more and they will stone me”! Yet, when they heard that the death of Moshe depended on the vengeance against Midian, @rr°@bbthey refused to go until they were handed over, against their wishes. @p16@p2<EN>Them, and Pinchas.@p3 @rr°@bbThis teaches that Pinchas was equivalent to all of them. But @rr°@bbwhy did Pinchas go, while Elozor did not? The Holy One, Blessed is He, said, “The one who began the @ITmitzvah@it @rr°@bbby executing Kozbi, the daughter of Tzur, should complete it.” Another interpretation: He sought to avenge Yoseif, his maternal forefather, as it is said, “the Midianites sold him.<TIE>.<TIE>.” How is it derived that the mother of Pinchas was [descended] from Yoseif? Since it is said, “of the daughters of Putiel (@hh<HEB>פּוּטִיאֵל@ee<ENG> ).” Of the children of Yisro, who fattened (@hh<HEB>פִּיטֵם@ee<ENG>) calves for idol worship, and of the children of Yoseif, who scorned (@hh<HEB>פִּטְפֵּט@ee<ENG>) his evil inclination. Another interpretation: He was annointed for warfare. @d1With the sacred vessels.@d2 @rr°@bbThis refers to the Ark and the Golden Headplate. Because Bil’am accompanied them, and caused the Midianite kings to fly through sorcery, he himself flying with them, he [Pinchas] displayed the Golden Headplate to them, in which the Divine Name was engraved, and they fell. This is why it is said, “.<TIE>.<TIE>.on those they had slain,”  concerning the Midianite kings — they fell from the air on the slain ones. Similarly, concerning Bil’am, it is written, “.<TIE>.<TIE>.upon those they had slain” in the book of Yehoshua. @d1In his hand.@d2 @rr°@bbIn his possession. Similarly, “he took his entire country @hh<HEB>מִיָדוֹ@ee<ENG>, from his possession.”<QC>
@p18@p2<EN>[The] five kings of Midian.@p3 Can I not see that Scripture enumerates five? Why, then, is it necessary to say “five”? Evidently, to teach that they all conspired equally, and they were all punished equally. Bil’am went there @rr°@bbto receive the reward for the twenty-four thousand whom he felled from Yisroel, through his advice. He went from Midian to the Bnei Yisroel,<FJ> @rr°@bband offered them evil advice. he said to them, “If when you were six hundred thousand you could not overcome them, and now you intend to fight them with twelve thousand?’ They gave him @rr°@bbhis reward, in full without stinting. @d1With the sword.@d2 He set upon Yisroel, exchanging his craft for theirs. For they are only victorious through verbal expression, through prayer and supplication. He came and took up their craft, to curse them verbally. So they confronted him as well by exchanging their craft for that of the gentiles, who come with the sword, as it is said, “you shall live by your sword.” @p110@p2<EN>Their palaces.@p3 The place of their guardians. The word (@hh<HEB>טִירֹתָם@ee<ENG>) denoting dwelling places for monks proficient in their laws. Another interpretation: The word denotes dwelling places for their ministers, as Targum renders “the P’lishtite @rr°@bbministers,” @hh<HEB>טוּרְנֵי פְלִשְׁתָּאֵי@ee<ENG>. @p111@p2<EN>They took all the booty, etc.@p3 This teaches that they were conscientious and righteous, beyond suspicion of theft through confiscating the booty without permission, as it is said, all the booty, etc. Concerning them, Scriptural tradition states explicitly, “your teeth are like a flock of sheep, etc.” — even the warriors among you are all righteous. @d1Booty.@d2 This refers to moveable property consisting of clothing and ornaments. @d1Plunder.@d2 [Refers to] @rr°@bbplunder of moveable property, that is non-ornamental. @d1All that had been seized.@d2 Men and beasts. When “captives” is written next to “spoils,” then “captives” refers to men, and “spoils” to beasts.<QC>
@p113@p2<EN>Moshe and Elozor the @BIkohein@BO went out.@p3 Because they saw the Israelite youths going out to seize some of the plunder. @p114@p2<EN>Moshe was angry with the commanders of the army.@p3 Who were appointed over the army. This teaches that the entire corruption of the generation is attributed to the great men, since they have the power to rebuke. @p116@p2<EN>They were the very same ones.@p3 This informs us that they recognized them — “this is the one through which so-and-so had his downfall.” @d1On Bil’am’s advice.@d2 He said to them, “Even if you gather together all the multitudes of the world, you will be unable to conquer them. Perhaps you are more numerous than the Egyptians, who had six hundred choice chariots? Come, I shall advise you. Their god despises promiscuity, etc.,’ as stated in “Chelek,” and in Sifri. @p117@p2<EN>And every woman with intimate knowledge of a man.@p3 @rr°@bbCapable of intimate relations, @rr°@bbeven if she never actually had relations. They brought them before the Golden Headplate — and those capable of relations — their faces turned sickly green. @d1You shall execute.@d2 Why is this repeated? To separate the matter— these are R’ Yishmael’s remarks. @rr°@bbFor, when I read, “execute every male among the children, and every woman with intimate knowledge of a man, and all the children among the females, etc.,” I do not know [concerning every woman with intimate knowledge of a man] whether to execute [them] with the males, or allow them to live with the children. @rr°@bbThis is why “[you must] execute” is said. @p119@p2<EN>Outside the camp.@p3 @rr°@bbSo that they would not enter the Sanctuary courtyard. @d1Whoever has killed a person.@d2 R’ Meir said, “Scripture refers to a person who kills with an object capable of receiving contamination, and Scripture teaches @rr°@bbthat a utensil defiles a person when it is in contact with a corpse as if he had touched the corpse itself. Or, perhaps even if he shot an arrow at him and killed him? The Torah, therefore, teaches, “and whoever touched a corpse.” It compares one who kills with one who touches. Just as the one who touches (receives contamination) through contact, so does the one who kills (receives contamination) through contact.” @d1Purify yourselves.@d2 With sprinkling water, as prescribed for others who were defiled by contact with the dead. For, even those who rule that Gentile graves do not convey contamination in a tent, — as it is said, “you, my sheep, my pastoral sheep, you are man”; you are entitled “man,” he admits that gentiles convey contamination through touching and carrying. @rr°@bbSince “man” was only said in the context of tent contamination, as it is said, “a person who dies in a tent.” @d1You and your captives.@d2 Not that the gentiles receive contamination and require sprinkling. Rather, just as you are members of the convenant, so with your captives, when they enter the covenant — should they become contaminated, @rr°@bbthey will require sprinkling. @p120@p2<EN>Everything made of goat products.@p3 @rr°@bbThis includes utensils made from the horns, hoofs, and bones. @p121@p2<EN>Elozor the @ITkohein@it said, etc.@p3 Because Moshe fell into a state of anger, he fell into a state of error, so concealed from him, were the laws concerning purging the utensils of gentiles. You find a similarity on the eighth day of inauguration, as it is said, “he was angry with Elozor and with Isamar”— he fell into a state of anger, [and] he fell into a state or error. Similarly with “listen, now, rebels”! “he struck the rock.” Because of anger, he erred.<QC>
@d1Which Adonoy commanded, etc.@d2 @rr°@bbHe credited the teaching to his master. @p122@p2<EN>Only the gold, etc.@p3 Although Moshe did not warn you except for the laws of ritual uncleanliness, you must be warned further, concerning the laws of purging. “Only” denotes exclusion, as if to say, ‘you are excluded from using the utensils, even after their purification from contamination by the dead, until they are purified from the absorption of forbidden “@ITneveilah@it” meat.’ Our Rabbis remark that “only the gold, etc.” teaches that one must remove its rust before purging it. This is the connotation of the word “only” — there should be no rust there, only the metal, exactly as it is. @p123@p2<EN>Anything placed on a fire.@p3 @rr°@bbIn which to cook something. @d1You must pass through fire.@d2 It must be purged the way it was used. Something used with heated water, one purges with heated water; something used for roasting, like a spit or a grill, one brings to white heat with fire. @d1However, it must be purified with sprinkling water.@d2 According to the plain interpretation, this purification is @rr°@bbto cleanse it from the contamination of the dead. He said to them, ‘The utensils require purging to purify them from prohibited food, and purification, to cleanse them from ritual contamination.’ And the Rabbis extrapolate here, that even for purification from prohibited [food contamination], metal utensils require immersion, and @hh<HEB>מֵי נִדָּה@ee<ENG> written here they expound as referring to water suitable for the immersion of the “@ITniddah.@it” How much is this? Forty @ITseah.@it @d1But anything that was not placed on a fire.@d2 Anything not used with fire, such as cups [and jugs], and flasks, which are used for cold food, and, therefore, did not absorb prohibited [food]. @d1You may pass through water.@d2 @rr°@bbImmerse them, and it is sufficient. This is only with metal utensils. @p124@p2<EN>Into the camp.@d2 To the camp of the @ITShechinah@it [only], for someone contaminated by the dead need not be banished from the camp of the Levites and the camp of the Israelites. @p126@p2<EN>Take count (lit. count the heads).@p3 @rr°@bbMake an accounting. @p127@p2<EN>Divide in half the spoils seized among those who took the war in hand, etc.@p3 @rr°@bbHalf for these, and half for these.<QC>
@p132@p2<EN>The spoil was — in addition to the booty.@p3 Because they were not commanded to contribute the tax from the moveable property, but from the spoil, the phrase was written this way. ‘the spoil, which would be included in the distribution and included in the tax, which remained after the plunder of personal property that the warriors plundered for themselves without distributing — [that spoil] was; the number of sheep, etc.’<QC>
@p142@p2<EN>From the half [designated] for Bnei Yisroel that Moshe divided.@p3 @rr°@bbFor the community, by appropriating it for them from the military men. @p143@p2<EN>The community’s half consisted of.@p3 @rr°@bbSo much and so much. @p147@p2<EN>Moshe took, etc.@p3<QC>

@p116@p2<EN>We will build [enclosures] for our flocks here.@p3 @rr°@bbThey were more concerned over their property than [over] their sons and daughters, for they gave precedence to their flocks over their children. Moshe said to them, ‘not so! Treat what is of major importance as such, and what is secondary as such. First build yourselves cities for your children, and afterward pens for your flocks.’ @p117@p2<EN>We will then arm ourselves rapidly.@p3 We will arm ourselves quickly, as in “quicken the spoil, hasten the plunder,” “let him hurry, hasten [his actions].” @d1Before Bnei Yisroel.@d2 At the head of the armies, since they were great warriors, as it is said concerning Gad, “he shall tear arms, skulls as well.” Moshe, too, reiterated specifically to them, in “These are the words”: “I commanded you at that time, etc., go forth armed before your brothers, Bnei Yisroel, all [you] great warriors.” And at Yericho it is written, “the armed force went before them” — they were [the sons of] Reuven and Gad, who fulfilled their condition. @d1Our children will dwell.@d2 @rr°@bbWhen we are with our brothers. @d1In fortified cities.@d2 @rr°@bbWhich we shall build now. @p119@p2<EN>Across the Yardein and beyond.@p3 @rr°@bbOn the western bank. @d1For, our inheritance came to us.@d2 We have already received it, on the eastern bank. @p124@p2<EN>For your sheep.@p3 This word is @rr°@bbconjugated from @hh<HEB>'צֹנֶה'@ee<ENG>, “all the sheep and cattle.” It does not have the “@hh<HEB> אָלֶ"ף@ee<ENG>“ intervening between the “@hh<HEB>נוּ"ן@ee<ENG>“ and “@hh<HEB>צָדִ"י@ee<ENG> “ and the “@hh<HEB>אָלֶ"ף@ee<ENG>“ which appears here after the “@hh<HEB>נּוּ"ן@ee<ENG>“ is instead of the “@hh<HEB>הֵ"א@ee<ENG>“ of @hh<HEB>צֹנֶה@ee<ENG>. I learned this from R’ Moshe Hadarshan’s commentary. @d1But what you have expressed verbally,@d2 you must fulfill. @rr°@bbFor the sake of Heaven, as you pledged to cross and do battle until the conquest and apportionment [of the land]. Moshe had only requested of them, “the land will be conquered, etc. and after you may return” but they pledged “until [Bnei Yisroel] have inherited” — so they added that they would remain for the seven years of apportionment, @rr°@bband they did so. @p125@p2<EN>The tribe of Gad said.@p3 @rr°@bbAll of them as one man.<QC>
@p128@p2<EN>[Moshe] commanded, to them.@p3 @rr°@bbLike @hh<HEB>עֲלֵיהֶם@ee<ENG>, concerning them and their stipulation, he appointed Elozor and Yehoshua, as in “God will fight for you.”<QC>
@p132@p2<EN>And we shall [then] have our permanent inheritance.@p3 As if to say, ‘in our hands, @rr°@bbin our possession, will be our hereditary territory on this side.’<QC>
@p136@p2<EN>Fortified cities and sheep pens.@p3 The end of this passage is related to the begning ofhe subject — “the sons of Gad built” these cities, @rr°@bbto serve as fortified cities and sheep pens. @p138@p2<EN>Nevo, Ba’al Me’on, their names having been changed.@p3 Nevo and Ba’al Meon were names of idols. The Emorites @rr°@bbwould name their cities after their idols, so the sons of Reuven changed their names in favor of other names. This is the meaning of “their names having been changed” — Nevo and Ba’al Me’on were turned aside in favor of a different name. @d1And Sivmah.@d2 @rr°@bbThey built Sivmah. This is Sevam mentioned above. @p139@p2<EN>And drove out.@p3 As Targum [Onkelos] renders, @hh<HEB>וְתָרִיךְ@ee<ENG>, “and ousted,” for the word @hh<HEB>יָרֹשׁ@ee<ENG> may be used in two ways, to denote inheritance, or to denote ousting, meaning driving out, expelling. @p141@p2<EN>Villages.@p3 @hh<HEB>כַּפְרְנֵיהוֹן@ee<ENG>, their villages. @d1And [he] called them Chavos Yair.@d2 Because he had no children, he called them by his name, as a memorial. @p142@p2<EN>And [he] called it Novach.@p3 @hh<HEB>לָה@ee<ENG> does not have a dot in its @hh<HEB>ה@ee<ENG>. I saw in R’ Moshe Hadarshan’s commentary: Because this name did not endure, it is therefore silent, implying that it is to be expounded as @hh<HEB>לָא@ee<ENG>, “not” [Novach]. But I wonder @rr°@bbhow he (R’ Moshe) would expound two similar words, @hh<HEB>וַיֹאמֶר 'לָה' בֹעַז@ee<ENG>, “Boaz said to her,” @hh<HEB>לִבְנוֹת לָה בַיִת@ee<ENG>, “to build her a house.”<QC>
@p11@p2<EN>These are the journeys.@p3 Why were these journeys recorded? To make the Omnipresent’s benevolence known. For, although He decreed to move them about and cause them to wander in the wilderness, do not say that they wandered and were moved about from journey to journey all forty years, and had no rest — for there are only forty two journeys here. Subtract fourteen, all of which took place during the first year, before the decree, from their journey from Ra’meses until they reached Rismah, from where the spies were dispatched, as it is said, “after, the people journeyed from Chatzeros, etc. Send, for yourself, men, etc.,” and here it says, “they journeyed from Chatzeros and camped at Rismah,” @rr°@bbyou learn that it was in the desert of Paran. Exclude, further, from there, eight journeys which took place after Aharon’s death, from Mount Hor to the plains of Moav, during the fortieth year, it is found @rr°@bbthat throughout the thirty eight years, they took only twenty journeys. This is from R’ Moshe [Hadarshan]’s commentary. R’ Tanchuma @rr°@bbexpounds the matter differently: This is compared to a king whose son was ill, and he brought him to a distant place for treatment. When they returned, the father began enumerating all the journeys. He said to him, @rr°@bb”Here, we slept; here, @rr°@bbwe were chilled; here, your head ached, etc.’<QC>
@p14@p2<EN>Egypt was burying.@p3 @rr°@bbThey were preoccupied with their grief.<QC>
@p118@p2<EN>And camped in Rismoh.@p3 @rr°@bbSo named after the spies’ slander, as it is said, “what will He (God) give you, and what more will He add for you, O deceitful tongue? Sharpened warrior’s arrows, with smoldering coals.”<QC>

This is why Scripture repeats it.<QC>
@p144@p2<EN>At the ruins of Avarim.@p3 The word [@hh<HEB>עִיֵּי@ee<ENG>] denotes desolation and waste, as in, “.<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>into a desolate field,” “they have turned Yerushalayim into desolation.” @p149@p2<EN>From Beis Yeshimos until Aveil Hasheetim.@p3 Here it teaches you @rr°@bbthe measure of the Israelite camp [was] twelve @ITmils,@it for Rava, the son of Bar Chana, said, “I have seen that place, etc.” @d1Aveil Hasheetim.@d2 @rr°@bbThe plain of Sheetim was entitled “Aveil.”<QC>

Midrash Aggadah remarks, because the Holy One, Blessed is He, caused the fall of the [celestial] ministers of the seven nations from heaven, and prostrated them before Moshe, and said to him, “observe, they no longer have any power.” @p13@p2<EN>Your southern flank shall be.@p3 The southern side, @rr°@bbfrom east to west. @d1From the Tzin wilderness.@d2 Which adjoining Edom, begins the @rr°@bbsoutheastern corner of the land of the nine tribes.

The land of Egypt is at the southwestern corner, as it is said in this @ITParshah,@it “[the border turns] from Atzmon to the Egyptian Estuary and its outskirts shall reach the sea.” The Egyptian Estuary’s path faced the entire land of Egypt, as it is said, @rr°@bb”from the [river] Shichor, facing Egypt,” and separates the land of Egypt from Eretz Yisroel.

When the Bnei Yisroel left Egypt, had the Omnipresent desired to hasten their entry into the land, He would have brought them northward across the Nile, and they would have entered Eretz Yisroel — but He did not do so. This is the meaning of what is said, “God did not lead them along the route of the land of the P’lishtim,” who dwelt by the sea, on the western border of the land of Canaan, as is said concerning the P’lishtim, “those who dwell on the territory by the sea, the Kereisite nation.” He did not lead them along that route, but diverted them, bringing them out by the southern route, into the wilderness — the Yechezkel called “the wilderness of nations,” because several nations dwelt alongside it. He then led them in the south from west to east, continuously, until they reached south of the land of Edom. They requested that the king of Edom permit them to enter his land, traverse its width, and enter the land, but he refused, so they had to travel around the entire southern side of Edom, until they reached south of the land of Moav, as it is said, “he also sent emissaries to the king of Moav, but he refused.” They traveled along the entire southern side of Moav, to the end. From there they turned their faces to the north, until they traveled around its entire eastern border along its width. When they completed its eastern side, they came upon the territory of Sichon and Og, who dwelt east of the land of Canaan, with the Yardein interposing between them. This is the meaning of what was said by Yiftach, “they traveled in the wilderness, proceeded around the land of Edom and the land of Moav, and came to [the end of] the eastern border of the land of Moav.” They conquered the territory of Sichon and Og, which was north of the land of Moav, and came abreast of the Yardein, opposite the northwest corner of the land of Moav. Thus, the land of Canaan across the Yardein to the west had its sourtheastern corner adjacent to Moav.<QC>
@p14@p2<EN>The border then turns south of Maaleh Akrabim.@p3 Wherever it says “turns” or “extends,” it teaches that the border was not even, but swerved away. The border swerves, @rr°@bbbending towards the north and angling west, so that the border passes south of Maaleh Akrabim — thus, Maaleh Akrabim was @rr°@bbwithin the border. @d1Passing toward Tzin.@d2 @hh<HEB>צִנָה@ee<ENG>, @rr°@bb”to Tzin,” like @hh<HEB>מִצְרַיְמָה@ee<ENG>, “to Egypt.” @d1Its outskirts shall be.@d2 Its ending, south of Kadeish Barne’a. @d1It shall extend to Chatzar Adar.@d2 The border spreads, broadening towards the north and @rr°@bbangling further west, until it reaches Chatzar Adar, from there to Atzmon, and from there to the Egyptian Estuary. @rr°@bbThe term “turns” is used here, because it wrote “it shall extend to Chatzar Adar.” It began broadening after crossing Kadesh Barne’a, and the breadth of the strip which protruded northward reached from Kadesh Barne’a to Atzmon. @rr°@bbFrom there and onward the border receded, turning toward the south until reaching the Egyptian Estuary, and from there west to the Mediterranean, which serves as the western border for all of Eretz Yisroel. Thus, the Egyptian Estuary is situated at the southwestern corner. @p15@p2<EN>Its outskirts shall reach the sea.@p3 Until the western border. The southern border no longer extends towards the west, past there. @p16@p2<EN>As for the western border.@p3 What is the western border? @d1It shall be the Great (Mediterranean) Sea.@d2 As a border. @d1And its border.@d2 @rr°@bbThe islands at sea are also part of the border. These islands are called “@ITisles@it” in Old French. @p17@p2<EN>The northern border.@p3 The northern border. @d1From the Great (Mediterranean) Sea, turn yourselves to Hor Hahar.@d2 Which is at the northwestern corner. Its peak slopes and enters the sea, with some of the expanse of the sea inward, @rr°@bband some outward. @d1Turn.@d2 Tilt yourselves to turn from west to north, to Mount Hor. @d1Turn.@d2 The term denotes turning, as in “to the runners’ annex,” “the annexes of the gateway.” The annex, called “@ITapendiz@it” in Old French, turns and slopes. @p18@p2<EN>From Hor Hahar.@p3 Turn and proceed along the northern border to the east, and you will encounter Levo Chamas — this is Antioch. @d1The outskirts of the border.@d2 The end of the border. Wherever “the outskirts of the border” is said, either the border ends there completely without continuing further at all; or it digresses from there, broadens, and extends in another direction, proceeding further at an angle to the original expanse. It is in relation to the breadth of the original dimension that it is called “extremity,” @rr°@bbfor that dimension ends there. @p19@p2<EN>Its outskirts shall be at Chatzar Einan.@p3 This was the end of the northern border. Thus, Chatzar Einan was situated at the northeastern corner. From there, “turn yourselves to the eastern border.”<QC>
@p110@p2<EN>Turn.@p3 The word [@hh<HEB>וְהִתְאַוִּיתֶם@ee<ENG>] denotes turning and tilting, like @hh<HEB>תְּתָאוּ@ee<ENG>. @d1To Shefam.@d2 On the eastern border, and from there to Rivlah. @p111@p2<EN>East of Ayin.@p3 The name of a place. The border passes to its east, so that Ayin is situated within the border, and is part of Eretz Yisroel. @d1The border shall descend.@d2 As the border proceeds from north to south, it continually descends. @d1And contact the bank of the eastern shore of the Kineres Sea.@d2 So that Lake Kineres was within the border, to the west. The border is east of Lake Kineres, and descends from there to the Yardein. The Yardein flows diagonally, from north to south, angling towards the east, moves towards the land of Canaan at Lake Kineres and continues along the eastern side of Eretz Yisroel opposite Lake Kineres, until emptying into the Dead Sea. From there, the border closes with its extremity reaching the Dead Sea, from which the southeastern corner of the border began, thus surrounding it on all four sides.<QC>
@p115@p2<EN>To the east, toward the sunrise.@p3 To the forefront of the world, which is east, as @rr°@bbthe eastern direction is called the forefront, and the western, the rear. Therefore, south is to the right, and north to the left.<QC>
@p117@p2<EN>Who shall inherit for you.@p3 @rr°@bbFor your sake. Each tribal leader was the guardian for his tribe, and @rr°@bbhe apportioned the tribal inheritance to the families and individuals. @rr°@bbHe chose a suitable portion for each individual, and their actions were binding, as if they had been designated as agents. But it would be improper to explain this @hh<HEB>לָכֶם@ee<ENG> [lit. “to you”] like every @hh<HEB>לָכֶם@ee<ENG> in Scripture, for, if so, it should have written @hh<HEB>יַנְחִילוּ לָכֶם@ee<ENG>, “they shall cause the inheritance to belong to you.” [@hh<HEB>לָכֶם@ee<ENG>] @hh<HEB>יִנְחֲלוּ@ee<ENG> means that they @rr°@bbshall inherit for you, for your sake, in your place, like @hh<HEB>ה' יִלָּחֵם לָכֶם@ee<ENG>, “God will wage war for your sake.”<QC>
@p118@p2<EN>To inherit the land.@p3 He is to inherit, take the portion of the land as your surrogate. @p129@p2<EN>To apportion the inheritance to Bnei Yisroel.@p3 They are to give the inheritance to you according to its portions. @p12@p2<EN>And open space.@p3 Open space, an empty area surrounding the city, to beautify the city. One is not permitted to build a house there, or plant a vineyard, or sow seeds.<QC>
@p13@p2<EN>And all of their necessities to live.@p3 For all their vital needs. @p14@p2<EN>A thousand @ITamos@it all around.@p3 But afterward it says, “two thousand @ITamos.@it” How is this? He gave them two thousand (@ITamos@it) all around the city. Of those, the inner thousand are for parkland, and the outer (thousand) are for fields and vineyards.<QC>
@p111@p2<EN>You shall provide.@p3 @hh<HEB>הַקְרָיָיה@ee<ENG> means [nothing but] providing. Similarly, it says, “because the Adonoy your God provided for me.” @p112@p2<EN>From the avenger.@p3 @rr°@bbAgainst the blood redeemer, who is the kinsman of the murder victim.<QC>
@p113@p2<EN>Six refuge cities.@p3 This teaches that although Moshe designated three cities across the Yardein, during his lifetime, they did not absorb, until the selection of @rr°@bbthe three that Yehoshua placed in the land of Canaan. @p114@p2<EN>Three cities, etc.@p3 Although there were, in the land of Canaan, nine tribes, and here only two and one half, the number of their cities of refuge was the same. Because Gil’ad was @rr°@bbrife<QC>
with murderers, as it is written, “Gil’ad, city of evildoers, @rr°@bbbloody ambush.” @p116@p2<EN>But if he struck him with an iron instrument. @p3 This does not refer to the inadvertent killing discussed in the preceding context, but, rather, to premeditated murder. It teaches that all implements of murder must be sizable enough to kill, for it is said, concerning all of them, “which can kill,” rendered by Targum [Onkelos], @rr°@bb”of a size capable of killing” — except for iron. For it is clearly evident to The Holy One, Blessed is He, that iron of any size can kill, even a needle. The Torah, therefore, did not specify a size by saying “which can kill.” Still, you may ask, “perhaps our passage refers to one who killed inadvertently?” @rr°@bbBut it states, below, “or, @rr°@bbwith a stone which can kill, without seeing, etc.” This teaches that, in its statements above, Scripture refers to premeditated murder. @p117@p2<EN>With a stone that can be held in the hand.@p3 @rr°@bbLarge enough to fill the hand. @d1Which can kill.@d2 Large enough to kill, as rendered by Targum [Onkelos]. Since it is said, “if a man strikes his fellow with a stone” without specifying its size, perhaps any size? It is said, therefore, “which can kill.”<QC>
@p118@p2<EN>Or with a wooden implement [that can be held] in the hand.@p3 Since it is said, “if a man strikes his slave or his maidservant with a rod,” perhaps any size? It is said, concerning wood, therefore, “which can cause death” — it must be sizable enough to kill. @p119@p2<EN>Wherever he meets him.@p3 @rr°@bbEven inside the cities of refuge.<QC>
@p120@p2<EN>Deliberately.@p3 As Targum [Onkelos] renders, @hh<HEB>בְּכַמְנָא@ee<ENG>, “from ambush.” @p122@p2<EN>Suddenly.@p3 Accidentally. Targum [Onkelos] renders @hh<HEB>בִּתְכֵיף@ee<ENG>, “suddenly.” He was nearby, and there was no time for him to take heed. @p123@p2<EN>Or with a stone which can kill.@p3 @rr°@bbHe struck him. @d1Without seeing.@d2 He did not see him.<QC>
@d1He threw it down on him.@d2 From here they (the Rabbis) said, “someone who kills @rr°@bbwhile descending, is exiled; [but if he kills] @rr°@bbwhile ascending, is not exiled.” @p125@p2<EN>Until the death of the @BIKohein gadol.@p3 As he causes the Divine Presence to reside in Israel, and lengthens their lives, while the murderer causes the Divine Presence to leave Israel, and shortens their lives, he (the murderer) is unworthy of being in the presence of the @ITKohein Gadol@it. Another interpretation: Because the @ITKohein Gadol@it should have prayed @rr°@bbthat this pitfall not occur in Israel during his lifetime. @d1Who was anointed with the sacred oil.@d2 According to its plain meaning, this is one of the shortened passages, as it does not explain @rr°@bbwho anointed him, but, rather, as if to say, “whom, whoever anointed him with the sacred oil.” Our sages expound this, in @ITMaseches@it Makos, as verification of a teaching, to teach that, if before his case was decided, the @ITKohein Gadol@it died and another was appointed in his place, and his case was then decided, he is released from exile at the death of the second, as it is said, “whom he anointed.” Was it he who anointed him as a @ITkohein,@it or a @ITkohein@it who anointed him? Therefore, this is meant to include one who was anointed in his days — that he is released from exile at his death. @p127@p2<EN>lit. He has no blood.@p3 It is as if he had murdered a lifeless man, as his blood is forfeit.<QC>
@p129@p2<EN>In all your dwelling places.@p3 This teaches that the lower Sanhedrin court functions outside the land @rr°@bbso long as it functions in Eretz Yisroel. @p130@p2<EN>If anyone lls a person, etc.@p3 @rr°@bbThe one who endeavors to kill him because he had killed a person.<TIE>.<TIE>. @d1Upon the testimony of witnesses shall [the murderer] be killed.@d2 Who testify that the murderer acted intentionally, @rr°@bband was forwarned. @p131@p2<EN>And do not accept atonement compensation.@p3 @rr°@bbHe cannot absolve himself with money @p132@p2<EN>And, do not accept atonement compensation for one who has fled to his refuge city.@p3 For, someone who fled to a refuge city because he killed inadvertently, is not absolved from exile with money, by paying atonement compensation so that he may return and dwell in the land before the @ITkohein@it dies. @d1@HB<HEB>לָנוּס@ee<ENG>.@d2 @rr°@bbLike @hh<HEB>לְנָס@ee<ENG>, as in @hh<HEB>שׁוּבֵי מִלְחָמָה@hh@ee<ENG>, “who returned from battle.” Similarly, @hh<HEB>נוּגֵי מִמּוֹעֵד@ee<ENG>, “who were excluded from the festivals.”  Similarly, @hh<HEB>כִּי מֻלִים הָיוּ@ee<ENG>, “for they were circumcised.” Just as one says @hh<HEB>שׁוּב@ee<ENG> concerning someone who has already returned, and @hh<HEB>מוּל@ee<ENG> concerning someone who was already circumcised, so does one say @hh<HEB>לָנוּס@ee<ENG> concerning someone who has already fled. He is called @hh<HEB>נוּס@ee<ENG> as if to say @hh<HEB>מֻבְרָח@ee<ENG>, “has fled.” But perhaps you might interpret @hh<HEB>לָנוּס@ee<ENG> as @hh<HEB>לִבְרוֹחַ @ee<ENG>,”to flee,” and explain “do not accept atonement compensation” “for someone who must flee,” and absolve him from exile? Then I do not know how it could say “so that he may return and dwell in the land,” when he did not yet flee — from where shall he return? @p133@p2<EN>Do not pollute (lit. falsely flatter).@p3 @rr°@bbDo not bring evil, as Targum [Onkelos] renders, @hh<HEB>וְלָא תְחַיְּבוּן@ee<ENG>, “do not bring guilt.”<QC>
@p134@p2<EN>Wherein I reside.@p3 Do not cause Me to reside in its defilement. @d1For I, Adonoy, dwell among Bnei Yisroel.@d2 Even when they are defiled, the Divine Presence rests among them. @p13@p2<EN>And it will be added to the inheritance of the tribe.@p3 Since her son is her heir, and the son’s tribal kinship follows his father’s.<QC>
