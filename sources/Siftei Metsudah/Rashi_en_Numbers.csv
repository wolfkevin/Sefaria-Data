Numbers 2:2,"2With the insignia. Each banner shall have [as] its insignia a colored cloth hanging from it. °Each one’s color was not like the other’s, each color corresponded with the hue of its gem set in the breastplate. Thusly, everyone could recognize his banner. Another interpretation [of] “with the insignia of their fathers’ houses”; By the sign their forefather Yaakov gave them °when they carried him from Egypt [for burial in Canaan], as it is said, “And his sons did to him just as he had commanded them” [Bereishis, 50:12]. ‘Yehudah, Yissachar, and Zevulun shall carry him from the east, Reuven, Shimon, and Gad from the south; etc.,’ as stated by Tanchuma to this portion.At a distance: °At the distance of a mil (2,000 amos, approximately 4,000 feet.) as stated in the Book of Joshua [3:4], ‘However, there should be a distance between you and it (the sacred ark) of two thousand amos’, To enable them to come on Shabbos. Moshe and Aharon and his sons and the Levites camped near it (the Mishkon). "
Numbers 3:1,"1These are the descendants of Aharon and Moshe. [Scripture] mentions only the sons of Aharon, yet they are called the descendants of Moshe — because he taught them Torah. This teaches us that one who teaches another’s son Torah is considered as having procreated him. On the day that Adonoy spoke to Moshe They became his descendants, °since he taught them what he had learned from the mouth of the Almighty. "
Numbers 4:2,"2Take the count ... etc. Count those among them suited °for the service of carrying, the ones from thirty to fifty years of age. Someone younger than thirty, has not reached prime strength. From here they (the Rabbis) derive “[the age of] thirty for strength” and after fifty, one’s strength diminishes."
Numbers 5:2,"2Command Bnei Yisroel. °This parshah was said on the day the Mishkon was erected. Eight parshiyos were said on that day, as is stated in Tractate Gittin, perek Hanizakin. They must expel from the camp. There were °three camps when they rested: Within the curtains was the camp of the Shechinah; the surrounding Levite encampment, as stated expressly in the parshah of Bemidbar Sinai, was the camp of the Levites; from there to the end of the encampment of the banners, in all the four directions, was the camp of the Israelites. The metzoro was sent °out of all of them. The zav was permitted in the camp of the Israelites, but expelled from the [other] two. A person defiled by the dead was permitted even among the [encampment of] the Levites, being expelled only °from the encampment of the Shechinah. All this, the Rabbis derive from Scriptural passages in Maseches Pesachim. Defiled by a [departed] soul. [Onkelos renders] דִּמְסָאָב לִטְמֵי נַפְשָׁא דֶאֱנָשָׁא, (“who were defiled by the bones of a human soul.”) In my opinion, the word °means “human bones” in Aramaic. There are many [examples] in Bereishis Rabbah, “טַמְיָא“ אַדְרִיאָנוּס שְׁחִיק — may [his] “bones” be crushed."
Numbers 6:2,"2If ... sets apart. Sets [himself] apart. Why is the chapter of the nazirite placed next to the chapter of the sotah? To tell you °that whoever observes a sotah °in her decadence should take the nazirite vow against wine, which leads to promiscuity. A nazirite vow. נְזִירָה always indicates abstinence. Here, too, he abstains from wine. To set [himself] apart for Adonoy. To separate himself from wine for the sake of heaven. "
Numbers 7:1,"1It came to pass, on the day Moshe finished. The text reads כַּלּוֹת. On the day that the Mishkon was erected, the Israelites were like a כַּלָּה — a bride entering the wedding canopy. Moshe finished. Bezalel, Aholiav, and all the wise — hearted men constructed the Mishkon, yet Scripture credits it to Moshe, °because he utterly dedicated himself to it, observing the structural design of each object as shown to him on the mountain (Sinai) in order to instruct the artisans, without making a single error in design. We find a similarity with regard to [king] David, because he utterly dedicated himself to the construction of the Beis Ha Mikdash — as it is said: “Remember, Adonoy, unto David all his afflictions; how he swore to Adonoy ... etc. it was, therefore, called by his name, as it is said: “Observe your House, David.” [On the day] Moshe finished erecting. It does not say, “On the day [Moshe] erected ...” This teaches that throughout the seven days of installation Moshe erected and dismantled it, and on that day, he erected it without dismantling it. This is why it says, “On the day Moshe finished erecting” — that day his erecting ended. It was the first of the month of Nisan. °On the second, the [red] cow was burned, on the third, they sprinkled with the first sprinkling, °and on the seventh, [after having been sprinkled again] they were shaven."
Numbers 8:2,"2When you light. Why is the parshah of the Menorah adjacent to the parshah of the leaders? Because when Aharon saw the leaders’ dedication (offerings) he was humiliated, since he did not join them in the dedication, neither he nor his tribe. The Holy One, Blessed is He, said to him, “By your life, yours is greater than theirs! For you will light and cleanse the lamps.” When you light (lit. cause to rise). °Because the flame rises, igniting is described in terms of “rising.” He is required to ignite [the lamp] until the flame rises by itself. In addition, the Rabbis derive from here °that there was a platform before the Menorah, °upon which the kohein stood when he lit [the lamps]. Toward the face of the Menorah. Toward the middle lamp which was not on one of the branches, but on the Menorah itself. Shall the seven lamps cast [their] light. The six [lamps] that were on the six branches [and one on its stem]. The three eastern ones turned toward the middle [by] °their wicks. Similarly, the three western ones — the heads of their wicks [were] towards the middle. Why? So that it whould not be said that He (God) needs the light. "
Numbers 9:1,"1In the first month. The chapter at the beginning of this book °was not said until Iyar. You learn, that there is no order of precedence or succession in the Torah. But why did He not begin with this [chapter]? Because it is to Yisroel’s discredit, °that throughout the forty years that Yisroel was in the wilderness they offered no other Pesach-offering but this. "
Numbers 10:2,"2(Make for yourself. So that they they may sound the trumpet before you like a king, as it is said, “There was a king among the righteous.” Make for yourself. From your own resources. Make for yourself. You shall make them and use them, but no one else.) To summon the congregation. When you want to speak with the Sanhedrin or the rest of the people, and you summon them to gather before you, summon them with the trumpets. And to initiate the departure of the camps. °At the time of the camps’ departure, sound them as a signal. Consequently, you say that they departed on the basis of three [initiatives]. By the word of the Holy One, Blessed is He; by the word of Moshe; and by the trumpets. Beaten. From a [single] ingot you should make it, by beating [it] with a hammer. "
Numbers 11:1,"1The people were like complainers. °”The people” refers only to the wicked. Similarly, it says, “what shall I do for this people,” and it says, “this evil people.” But when they are °righteous, they are called “My people,” as it says, “send out My people,” “My people, what have I done to you” Like complainers. מִתְאֹנְנִים is strictly a term referring to a pretext. They seek a pretext in order to turn away from [following] after the Omnipresent. Similarly, it says about Shimshon, “for he seeks a pretext.” Wicked in the ears of Adonoy. A complaint which is wicked in the ears of God, for they intended it to reach His ears and anger Him. They said, “Woe to us, °how we have toiled on this journey. Three days [have passed] that we have not rested from the fatigue of travel.” And His anger flared. I meant for your benefit, so that you would enter the land immediately. The outcasts of the camp. Those among them who were outcasts, of low status, they were the great mixture. R’ Shimon ben Menasya says, °the distinguished among them, and the great ones. "
Numbers 12:1,"1[Miriam] spoke. דִּבּוּר always connotes harshness, as it says, “The man who rules the land spoke harshly with us.” But אֲמִירָה always connotes pleading, as it says, “He said, please, my brothers, do not be wicked,” “He said, please hear my words.” נָא always connotes a request. Miriam and Aharon spoke. She opened the discussion first, so Scripture gives her precedence. °How did Miriam know that Moshe separated from his wife? R’ Noson says: Miriam was at Tziporah’s side when Moshe was told that Eldad and Meidad were prophesying in the camp. When Tziporah heard, she said, ‘Woe to their wives if they become attached to prophecy, because they will separate from their wives the way my husband separated from me.’ Miriam knew from there, and she told Aharon. Now if Miriam, who did not intend to slander him, was punished this way, certainly someone who relates slander about his fellow. The Cushite woman. This teaches that everyone agreed to her beauty, °just as everyone agrees to the blackness of the Cushite. Cushite. [כּוּשִׁית is] numerically equivalent to יְפַת מַרְאֶה , (“beautiful in appearance.”) Concerning the woman. °Concerning her divorce. For, he married a Cushite woman. What does the Torah teach? You find a woman beautiful in appearance but not beautiful in deed; in deed, but not in appearance. But this one was beautiful in everything. The Cushite woman. Because of her beauty, she was called “Cushite,” like a man who calls his attractive son “Cushite” to ward off the power of the evil eye over him. For, he married a Cushite woman. And now divorced her. "
Numbers 13:2,"2Send, for yourself. °Why is the chapter of the spies adjacent to the chapter of Miriam? Because she was punished over the matter of her slanderous conversation about her brother, and those wicked men saw, but did not accept reproof. Send, for yourself. °According to your opinion I do not command you. If you wish, send. Because the Israelites came and said, ‘let us send men before us,’ as it is said, “all of you approached me, etc.” °Moshe conferred with the Shechinah. He (Hashem) said, ‘I told them that it is good, as it is said, “I will bring you up from the suffering of Egypt, etc.” By their lives! I’ll give them °an opportunity for error with the report of the spies, so that they will not inherit it. "
Numbers 14:1,"1The entire community The Sanhedrin members."
Numbers 15:2,2(When you arrive. He informed them that they would enter the land.) 
Numbers 16:1,"1Korach took. °This passage is beautifully expounded by Midrash R’ Tanchuma. Korach took. He took himself to a different side, to be °disassociated from the community and to cast aspersion on the kehunah. This is why Onkelos translates וְאִתְפְּלֵג, he separated himself from the rest of the community in order to maintain the dispute. Similarly, “why does your heart take you?”— (i.e.,) it takes you to separate you from other people. °Another interpretation [of] “Korach took”: He won over the heads of the Sanhedrin among them, with flattering words, as it is said, “take Aharon,” “take words with you.”The son of Yitzhar, the son of Kehos, the son of Levi. But °Scripture does not mention, “the son of Yaakov,” since he [Yaakov] implored [God] for compassion on himself that his name be omitted from their dispute, as it is said, “let my honor not be identified with their assembly.” °Where is his (Yaakov’s) name mentioned with Korach? At the genealogical identification [of the Levites] at the platform, in Divrei Hayamim, as it is said, “the son of Evyasaf, the son of Korach, the son of Yitzhar, the son of Kehos, the son of Levi, the son of Yisroel.” And Dasan and Aviram. Because the tribe of Reuven made their camp at the south, °neighboring Kehos and his sons, who camped at the south, they joined Korach in his dispute. °”Woe to the wicked, woe to his neighbor”! °Why did Korach see fit to dispute Moshe? He envied °Elitzafan the son of Uziel for his leadership. Moshe appointed him leader over the sons of Kehos, by the word of God. Korach said, ‘Father had four brothers, as it is said: “The sons of Kehos, etc.” Amram was the firstborn. His two sons assumed great distinction — one (Moshe) is the monarch, the other (Aharon) the Kohein Gadol. Who should appropriately assume the second [position], if not I, the son of Yitzhar, second to Amram? Yet he appointed, as leader, the son of the youngest of all of his (Amram’s) brothers. I will oppose him, and nullify everything he said.’ What did he do? He rose up and gathered two hundred fifty heads of Sanhedrin, mostly from the neighboring tribe of Reuven — they were Elitzur the son of Shdeiur, and his companions, and the like, as it is said, “leaders of the congregation, who were called to meetings,” and it says above, °”those called from the congregation (leaders of their ancestral tribes).” He clothed them in °garments made completely of techeiles. They came and stood before Moshe and said to him: “Does a garment made completely of techeiles require tzitzis, or not?’ He said to them: “It is required.” They began scoffing at him. “How is it possible that a garment made of other material is absolved by a single thread of techeiles, yet one made completely of techeiles cannot absolve itself?” The sons of Reuvein. °Dasan and Aviram, and On the son of Peles. "
Numbers 17:2,"2And the fire. °In the firepans. Scatter yonder. To the ground, °from the firepans. For, they were sanctified. °The firepans, and may not be used for personal benefit, since they designated them as sacred service utensils. "
Numbers 18:1,"1Adonoy said to Aharon. He told Moshe °to say to Aharon, To exhort him concerning [precautions] for the benefit of the Israelites, so that they do not enter the Sanctuary. You, your sons, and your father’s house. °The children of Kehos, Amram’s father. Will bear the sin of the Sanctuary. I am casting, upon you, the punishment of the unauthorized persons who sin by their involvement with the sacred objects placed in your charge — the Tent, Ark, Table, and sacred vessels. You must station yourselves and warn every unauthorized person who attempts contact. And you and your sons. The kohanim. Will bear the sin of your kehunah. Since it is not a charge given to the Levites, you must warn the erring Levites not to come in contact with you during your service. "
Numbers 19:2,"2This is the statute of the Torah. °Because Satan and the nations of the world taunt Israel, saying, “What is this commandment? °What is the reason for it”? Therefore, the Torah referred to it as חֻקָּה, a statute. I have decreed it, and you are not permitted to question it.They shall take to you. °It will always be called by your name: °”The cow which Moshe prepared in the wilderness.” Red, perfect. °It must be perfectly red. If it had °two black hairs, it was disqualified. "
Numbers 20:2,"2They shall take to you. From their own. Just as they removed the golden rings, for the [golden] calf, from their own, so shall they bring this from their own as atonement. A red cow. This is compared to the child of a maidservant who sullied the king’s palace. They said, “let the child’s mother come and wipe away the filth.” Similarly, °let the cow come and atone for the calf. Red. To correspond with “If they [your sins] are as red as crimson...” Sin is described as red. Perfect. To correspond with the Israelites, who were perfect, but then were blemished by it. This [offering] shall come and atone for them, and they will return to their perfection. Upon which no yoke was laid. Just as they discarded the yoke of Heaven. "
Numbers 21:1,"1The entire community. The entire, perfect community. °Those who were to die in the desert had already perished, and these were set apart to live.Miriam died there. °Why is the portion concerning Miriam’s death adjacent to the portion of the parah adumah? To teach you that, °just as the sacrifices bring atonement, °so do the deaths of the righteous bring atonement. Miriam died there. She, too, died °by the Divine kiss. °Why, then, is it not said, concerning her, “by the mouth of God”? Because this would be lacking in reverence toward the Supreme Being. Concerning Aharon, however, it is said, “by the mouth of God,” in “these are the journeys.” "
Numbers 22:1,"1The Canaanite heard. °He heard that Aharon died, and the clouds of glory departed, etc. as stated in Rosh Hashanah. Amelek was always a whip for disciplining Israel, prepared, at all times, to mete out punishment.Who lived in the south. °This was Amalek, as it is said, “Amelek dwells in the southern part of the land.” They changed their language, and spoke in the Canaanite tongue, so that the Israelites would pray to the Holy One, Blessed is He, to deliver the Canaanites into their hands —but they were not Canaanites. The Israelites saw that they were dressed in Amalekite clothing, but spoke the Canaanite tongue. They said, “let us pray in a general way,” as it is said, “if you will deliver this people into my hand.” By the route of the spies. The negev route traveled by the spies, as it is said, “they went up to the negev.” Another interpretation of דֶּרֶךְ הָאֲתָרִים; the route of °the great pathfinder which traveled before them, as it is said, “[the Ark of the covenant of God traveled before them] three days’ journey, to seek out a resting place for them.” He took from them a captive. It was only °one maidservant. "
Numbers 23:2,"2Balak saw ... all that Yisroel had done to the Emorite. °He said, “Those two kings whom we relied on could not withstand them, °certainly we can not.” Therefore, “Moav became terrified.” "
Numbers 24:3,"3Perhaps, Adonoy will appear to me. °He does not usually speak with me by day. He went away alone. As Targum [Onkelos] translates, “alone.” The word denotes placidity and quiet, as nothing but silence accompanied him. "
Numbers 25:1,"1Bil’am saw that it was favorable, etc. He said, “it is no longer necessary for me to test the Holy One, Blessed is He, for He will never want to curse them. He did not approach, as at each time. As he had done twice. Towards sorcery. To divine whether God would perhaps chance to appear to him as he wished. He said, “Whether or not He wants to curse them, °I will mention their sins, so that the curse will descend with the mention of their sins.” He set his face toward the wilderness. °As Targum [Onkelos] renders."
Numbers 26:1,"1In Shittim. °This was its name.Acting promiscuously with the daughters of Moav. As a result of Bil’am’s advice, °as stated in “Chelek.” "
Numbers 27:1,"1It was after the plague, etc. °This is compared to a shepherd whose flock was infiltrated by wolves, who killed some of them. He counted them, to ascertain the number of those remaining. Another interpretation: When they left Egypt and were entrusted to Moshe, they were given to him with a reckoning; now that he neared death, and the return of his sheep, he returned them with a reckoning."
Numbers 28:1,"1Of the families of Menashe the son of Yoseif. Why is this said? Has it not already said “the son of Menashe”? But it teaches you: Yoseif cherished the land, as it is said: “You must carry up my bones up, etc.,” and his daughters cherished the land, as it is said: “Give us possession,”! And °to teach you, that they were all righteous. For where someone’s deeds, and the deeds of his forefathers, are not defined, and Scripture specifically relates one of them to a virtuous ancestor, then this is a righteous person, the son of a righteous person. If he is related disparagingly, as, for example, “Yishmael, the son of Nesanyah, the son of Elishama,” then it is known that everyone mentioned with him was villainous. Machlah, No’ah, etc. Below it says, “Machlah and Sirtzah were...” This teaches that they were all equal — the order was, therefore, changed. "
Numbers 29:2,"2Command Bnei Yisroel. What is stated above? °”May God command...” The Holy One, Blessed is He, said to him, °‘Before you command Me concerning My children, command My children concerning Me.’ This is comparable to a princess who was passing from the world. She instructed her husband concerning her children, etc., as is stated in Sifri. My offering. °This refers to the blood. My bread. °This refers to the “emurin” parts, as it is said, “The kohein shall burn them on the altar, bread of the fire.” Of My fires. to be placed on the fires of My altar. You shall be vigilant.

Numbers 30:6,"6Aside from the [Rosh] Chodesh burnt- offering.  The [Rosh] Chodesh Musaf- offerings, as it (the new moon) corresponds with the new year."
Numbers 31:1,"1Moshe spoke to Bnei Yisroel. This concludes the subject, comments R’ Yishmael. °Because, up until this point, we have the words of the Omnipresent, and the chapter of vows begins with the words of Moshe, it is necessary to conclude the subject by saying that Moshe reviewed this parshah with the Israelites. Otherwise, the implication would be that he (Moshe) did not tell them this, but began his discourse with the chapter of vows."
Numbers 32:2,"2Against the Midianites. °But not against the Moavites, for the Moavites entered the matter out of fear. They were afraid of them, [fearing] that they would plunder them, as it only says, “do not provoke them with warfare.”  The Midianites, however, were °enraged over a dispute which was not theirs. Another interpretation: °for the sake of two virtuous doves whom I must extract from them — Rus the Moavite, and Na’amah the Ammonite. "
Numbers 33:3,"3Ataros, Divon, etc. °They were part of the land of Sichon and Og."
Numbers 34:1,"1These are the journeys. Why were these journeys recorded? To make the Omnipresent’s benevolence known. For, although He decreed to move them about and cause them to wander in the wilderness, do not say that they wandered and were moved about from journey to journey all forty years, and had no rest — for there are only forty two journeys here. Subtract fourteen, all of which took place during the first year, before the decree, from their journey from Ra’meses until they reached Rismah, from where the spies were dispatched, as it is said, “after, the people journeyed from Chatzeros, etc. Send, for yourself, men, etc.,” and here it says, “they journeyed from Chatzeros and camped at Rismah,” °you learn that it was in the desert of Paran. Exclude, further, from there, eight journeys which took place after Aharon’s death, from Mount Hor to the plains of Moav, during the fortieth year, it is found °that throughout the thirty eight years, they took only twenty journeys. This is from R’ Moshe [Hadarshan]’s commentary. R’ Tanchuma °expounds the matter differently: This is compared to a king whose son was ill, and he brought him to a distant place for treatment. When they returned, the father began enumerating all the journeys. He said to him, °”Here, we slept; here, °we were chilled; here, your head ached, etc.’"
Numbers 35:2,"2This is the land which will fall to you, etc. Since many commandments apply in the land, but do not apply outside the land, it was necessary to record °the outer reaches of the borders of its perimeter, to inform you that within those borders, the commandments apply. Will fall to you. Because it was apportioned by lot, the apportionment is described °in terms of falling. Midrash Aggadah remarks, because the Holy One, Blessed is He, caused the fall of the [celestial] ministers of the seven nations from heaven, and prostrated them before Moshe, and said to him, “observe, they no longer have any power.” "
Numbers 36:2,"2And open space. Open space, an empty area surrounding the city, to beautify the city. One is not permitted to build a house there, or plant a vineyard, or sow seeds."
Numbers 37:3,"3And it will be added to the inheritance of the tribe. Since her son is her heir, and the son’s tribal kinship follows his father’s."
