Genesis 2:2,"2Elohim completed by the seventh day. R. Shimon said, [man who is] flesh and blood who cannot [precisely] know his times and moments must add from the profane to the holy. Hashem, who [precisely] knows His times and moments it can enter into it by a hairbreadth, and it appears as if He concluded [His work] on that very day [i.e., the Sabbath].Another explanation: [At this point in time,] what was the world [still] lacking? [The concept] of rest. With the coming of Shabbos came rest, [i.e.,] the work was completed and finished. "
Genesis 3:1,"1The serpent was more cunning. Why is this incident inserted here [i.e., connected to the preceding verses]? He should have connected it [with] [the verse:] “And He made for Adam and his wife leather coats and clothed them.” But, it comes to teach you the cause of the serpent’s assailing them. He saw them unclothed, indulging in marital relations unashamedly and he coveted her. More cunning than any. As cunning and mighty [as he was] [so, too,] was his downfall. Most cunning of all, [became] most cursed of all. Did [He] even say, etc. Did He perhaps tell you not to eat from any of the trees of the garden, etc.? And, although he saw them eating from the other fruits he indulged her in conversation so that she should be obliged to answer him, and give him the opportunity to speak about that particular tree."
Genesis 4:1,"1The man knew. This had already [occurred] before the previous narrative [i.e.,] before he sinned and was exiled from Gan Eden. This is also [true of] the conception and birth. Had it said וַיֵּדַע אָדָם it would imply that after he was exiled children were born to him. Kayin. [This name was given him] based on [her having said] קָנִיתִי [“I have obtained”]. With Adonoy. [אֶת ה' means] like עִם ה' [with Hashem]. [Meaning:] “When He created me and my husband He created us by Himself. However, in this one we are co-partners with Him.” To Kayin, to his brother, to Hevel. The word אֶת is repeated thrice implying additional [facts or things]. This teaches that a girl twin was born with Kayin, and two were born with Hevel. Consequently, [concerning Hevel] it says: [Lit.] “And she increased” [in giving birth]. "
Genesis 5:1,1This is the book of the generations of man. [Meaning:] This is the narrative of the offspring of man. There are many other Aggadaic interpretations. On the day Elohim created. This tells us that on the same day that he was created he begot children. 
Genesis 6:2,"2The sons of rulers. [Meaning:] the sons of princes and rulers. Another explanation of בְּנֵי הָאֱלֹהִים: They are the angels who go as messengers of Hashem; they, too, intermingled with them. Whenever אֱלֹהִים appears in Tanach it has the meaning of authority. The following is indicative: “You will be his master.” “See that I have made you a master.” That [they] were fair. R. Yudan said: It is spelled טבת, [meaning:] when they improved her appearance beautifying her to enter the marriage canopy, the head ruler would then enter and have relations with her first. From whomever they chose. Even a married woman, even a man or an animal. "
Genesis 7:1,"1For I have seen that you are righteous.  Here it does not state צַדִּיק תָּמִים! [We learn] from this that we tell only part of a man’s good qualities in his presence, and all of them when he is not present. "
Genesis 8:1,"1Elohim remembered. This name represents Divine Judgment which was transformed to Divine Mercy due to the prayers of the righteous. [However,] the evil of the wicked  transforms Divine Mercy to Divine Judgment as it is said: “God saw that the wickedness of man was great, etc.,” “God said I will obliterate” though the Name [ה'] represents Divine Mercy. Elohim remembered Noach. What did He remember regarding the animals? The merit that they did not corrupt their ways before this [the Flood]  and that they did not cohabit in the ark.Elohim caused a wind to blow. [רוּחַ means] a spirit of comforting and calming passed before Him. Over the earth. [Meaning:] due to the matters of the earth. Subsided. As in: “When the wrath of the king calmed” referring to the abandonment of anger. "
Genesis 9:2,"2Your terror. [Means:] “your terror,” as in: “You see terror.” The Aggadah, [however, explains it] as “life.” [I.e.,] as long as even a one-day old infant is alive you do not have to watch it from [being harmed by] rodents. [However, should the giant] Og, king of Bashan, die, he would need guarding against rodents. For it is stated: וּמוֹרַאֲכֶם וְחִתְּכֶם יִהְיֶה, [meaning:] when do animals fear you? [Only] as long as you are alive. "
Genesis 10:2,"2And Tiras. This refers to Persia."
Genesis 11:1,"1One language. [That language was] the holy language [Hebrew]. And conforming words. [Meaning:] They came with one plan and said, “He [God] has no right to select the heavens for Himself. Let us ascend to the sky and wage war against Him.” Another explanation [of דְּבָרִים אֲחָדִים]: [They spoke blasphemously] against  the Sole Being of the universe. Another explanation for וּדְבָרִים אֲחָדִים, They said; “Once every 1656 years the heavens convulse  as He did in the days of the Flood. Come, let us make supports for it. "
Genesis 12:1,"1Go. [Meaning:] “For your own benefit, for your own good. It is there that I will make you into a great nation, [whereas] here you will not merit having children. Also, I will make your character known to the world.”"
Genesis 13:1,"1Avram went up...into the south. [Meaning:] to arrive at the south of Eretz Yisrael, as it was stated above, “traveling steadily southward,” [meaning:] to Mount Moriah. Nevertheless, when one travels from Egypt to the Land of Canaan, he travels from south to north, for Egypt is south of Eretz Yisrael as can be shown by the “journeys” and at the boundaries of Eretz Yisrael. "
Genesis 14:1,"1Amraphel. He is Nimrod who told Avraham, “Jump into the fiery furnace.” King of Goyim. There is a place called Goyim because in that place were gathered [people] from many nations and places and they proclaimed as king a man named Sidal. "
Genesis 15:1,"1After these events. Wherever אַחַר is used it signifies immediately [after]. [When] אַחֲרֵי [is used] [it means] long afterwards. [Thus, immediately] “after these events,” [i.e.,] after this miracle occurred to him that he killed the kings, he became anxious and said, “Maybe I have already received my reward for all my righteousness.” Therefore, God said to him... Fear not Avram, I am your shield. From punishment. [I.e.,] that you will not be punished for all the people that you killed. And as for you anxiety that you have already received you reward, “Your reward is very great.” "
Genesis 16:1,"1An Egyptian handmaid. She was Pharaoh’s daughter. When he [Pharaoh] saw the miracles that were performed for Sarah, he said: “Better that my daughter be a servant-maid in this house rather than the mistress of another house.”"
Genesis 17:1,"1I am Almighty Shaddai. [Meaning:] “I am the One Whose Godliness suffices for every creature. Therefore, walk before Me and I will be your God and Protector.” Similarly, wherever it appears in Scripture its explanation is thus: “He is sufficient.” However, it also depends on the context. Walk before me. As he [Onkelos] translates: “Worship Me.” Cling to My worship.And be perfect. This, too, is an imperative following an imperative, [i.e.,] “Be perfect in all the tests.” According to its Midrash: “Walk before Me” refers to the precept of circumcision and as a result of this you will become perfect. For as long as you are uncircumcised, I consider you imperfect. Another explanation of וֶהְיֵה תָמִים: Now you are lacking [control over] five organs; two eyes, two ears, and the membrum; by adding one letter to your name the numerical value of the letters [of your name] will be two hundred and forty-eight corresponding to the number of your organs. "
Genesis 18:1,"1[He] appeared to him. To visit the sick person. R. Chama bar Chanina said: It was the third day since his circumcision and God came to inquire about his welfare.In the groves of Mamrei. He [Mamrei] advised him regarding the circumcision. Therefore, He appeared to him [Avraham] in his [Mamrei’s] territory.Was sitting. It is written יָשַׁב [without a וא""ו]. [This indicates that] he wanted to rise [when] God said to him, “Sit, and I will stand, and you will symbolize to your descendants that I am destined to stand in the assembly of judges while they remain seated,” as it is said: “Elohim stands in the assembly of judges.” At the door of the tent. To see if there are any passers by that he might invite into his home. In the heat of the day. God brought the sun out of its sheath so that he would not be burdened by travelers. But, when He saw that he [Avraham] was grieved that no travelers were coming, He brought the angels to him in the guise of men."
Genesis 19:1,"1Two. One to destroy Sedom and one to save Lot. The third one who came to foretell to Sarah [of her giving birth]— once he fulfilled his mission—departed. Angels. Elsewhere they are called men. When the Divine Presence was with them they are called men. Another explanation: In relation to Avraham whose power was great and angels were as common to him as men, they are referred to as men. But, relative to Lot, they are called angels. In the evening. Did it take that long for the angels [to travel] from Chevron to Sedom? But, they were angels of mercy, and they procrastinated— perhaps Avraham will succeed [in his attempt] to defend them. While Lot was sitting at the gate of Sedom. It is written יָשַׁב [without a ו because] on that day they appointed him to be their judge.Lot saw. He had learned from the house of Avraham to seek out travelers. "
Genesis 20:1,1Avraham journeyed from there. When he saw that the cities were destroyed and the travelers ceased passing by he departed from there. An alternate explanation: In order to distance himself from Lot who had acquired a bad reputation that he was incestuous with his daughters. 
Genesis 21:1,"1Adonoy remembered Sarah. This section was placed here to teach you that whoever prays for mercy for another and he [the one who prays] needs the same thing, he will be answered first. For it states: “he [Avraham] prayed,” etc., and immediately: “Adonoy remembered Sarah,” i.e., He had already remembered [even] before He had cured Avimelech. Remembered Sarah as He had said. [This refers to the promise] of conceiving. As He had spoken. [Referring to the promise] of giving birth. Where is [the reference to God’s] saying? and where is [the reference to God’s] speaking? Saying: “Elohim said: Indeed your wife Sarah,” etc. Speaking: “The word of Hashem came to Avram at the Covenant Between the Pieces,” where it is stated: “That one [Eliezer] will not be your heir” and He brought forth the heir from Sarah. And Adonoy did for Sarah as He had spoken. [Meaning] as He spoke] to Avraham."
Genesis 22:1,"1After these events. There are some Sages who say [that this event occurred:] “After the words of Satan” who said accusingly, [to God], “From all the feasts that Avraham prepared, he did not offer to sacrifice to You a single bull or ram.” He [God] responded to him, “Does he do anything but for the sake of his son? Yet, if I were to say to him, ‘Sacrifice him to Me,’ he would not refuse.” Other [Sages] say [that this refers to] “After the words of Yishmael” who would boast to Yitzchok that he was circumcised when he was thirteen and offered no resistance. Yitzchok responded to him: “Do you intimidate me [with the loss] of one limb? If God would tell me, ‘Sacrifice yourself to Me,’ I would not refuse.” Here I am. This is the response of the pious— an expression of humility and readiness. "
Genesis 23:1,"1The lifetime of Sarah consisted of one hundred years, twenty years and seven years. The reason the word שָׁנָה [year] is written with every set is to tell you that every set is to be explained by itself. [When she was] 100 years old she was like a 20 year old, regarding sin. Just as when she was 20 she was not considered as having sinned since she was not yet subject to punishment, so, too, at 100 she had not sinned. And when she was 20 she was like a seven-year-old, regarding [her] beauty. The years of Sarah’s life. [This tells us] that they were all equally good. "
Genesis 24:1,"1Blessed Avraham in all things. בַּכֹּל is numerically equal to בֵּן [son], and since he had a son he needed to find a wife for him. "
Genesis 25:1,"1Keturah. This is Hagar. She was called קְטוּרָה because her deeds were as beautiful as קְטוֹרֶת [the incense in the Temple] and because she “tied her womb” and did not mate with any man from the time she separated from Avraham."
Genesis 26:2,"2Do not go down to Egypt. Because he [Yitzchok] intended to go down to Egypt as his father had gone down during the days of the famine. He [God] said to him, “Do not go down to Egypt for you are a burnt-offering without blemish and being outside the [Holy] land does not befit you.” "
Genesis 27:1,"1His eyesight faded. Because of the smoke of these [women] who would burn incense for idol worship. Another explanation: When he was bound on the altar and his father intended to slaughter him, at that moment the heavens opened and the ministering angels saw and cried. Their tears descended and fell upon his eyes. As a result his eyesight dimmed. Another explanation: To enable Yaakov to receive the blessings."
Genesis 28:2,2To Padan. Is the same as לְפַדָּן. To the house of Besueil. [The same as] לְבֵית בְּתוּאֵל. Any word that requires a ל' prefix may [instead] have a ה' put at the end of it. 
Genesis 29:1,"1Yaakov [then] lifted his feet. Once he was foretold the good tiding that he was assured of [God’s] protection, his heart lifted his feet and it became easy for him to go [swiftly]. It is thus explained in Bereishis Rabbah. "
Genesis 30:1,1Rochel became jealous of her sister. She was envious of her good deeds. She thought: “Were she not more righteous than I she would not merit bearing children.” Give me. [She implied:] “Did your father act this way to your mother? Did he not pray for her?” I am [considered] dead. From here [we learn] that one who has no children is considered as if dead. 
Genesis 31:1,"1He made. [Here meaning:] gathered, as in “He gathered an army and struck Amaleik.” "
Genesis 32:2,2And the angles of Elohim met him. Angels of Eretz Yisrael came to meet him in order to accompany him into the [Holy] Land. 
Genesis 33:2,2Leah and her sons behind them. The later [mentioned] the more beloved. 
Genesis 34:1,"1The daughter of Leah. [Why is she] not [called] “the daughter of Yaakov”? But, because of her “going out” she is called “the daughter of Leah” because she [Leah] too, was in the habit of “going out,” as it is said, “And Leah went out to meet him.” (She is the source of the adage: “Like mother like daughter.”) "
Genesis 35:1,"1Arise, go up. Because you lingered on your journey, you have been punished and this [trouble] of your daughter has come to you. "
Genesis 36:2,"2Adah, the daughter of Eylon. She is [also called] Bosmas the daughter of Eylon. and she is called Bosmas because she would burn incense—besamim to idols. Oholivomoh. She is [also called] Yehudis. He [Eisov] called her by the name Yehudis [meaning Jewess] to indicate that she denies idolatry in order to mislead his father. The daughter of Anoh, daughter of Tzivon. If she was the daughter of Anoh then she was not the daughter of Tzivon! [But the explanation is] Anoh was the son of Tzivon, as it is said: “These are the sons of Tzivon: Ayoh and Anoh,” thus telling us that Tzivon came upon his daughter-in-law, Anoh’s wife, and Ohilovomoh was born as a result of both. Scripture thereby informs you that they were all of illegitimate birth. "
Genesis 37:1,"1Yaakov settled, etc. After it [Scripture] has written for you concerning the settlements of Eisov and his descendants in a concise manner— because they were neither notable nor important enough to warrant a detailed explanation of how they settled, or the narrative of their wars by which they drove out the Chorites; it now proceeds to detail for you the settlements of Yaakov and his descendants at length and the sequence of events which were their cause. Because they are esteemed before God, they deserve to be discussed at length. You also find [this, concerning] the ten generations from Adam to Noach: “So-and-so gave birth to so-and-so.” But, when it came to Noach [Scripture] discussed him at length. Similarly, concerning the ten generations from Noach till Avraham [Scripture] speaks of them in concise terms, and when [the narrative] reaches Avraham it discusses him at length. This is comparable to a jewel that has fallen into the sand. A person searches the sand and sifts it through a sieve until he finds the jewel. Once he finds the jewel, he discards the pebbles from his hand and takes hold of the jewel. (Another explanation of “Yaakov settled:” [There was once] a particular flax dealer whose camels arrived laden with flax. The blacksmith wondered: “Where will all this flax be stored?” There was a wise man there who responded: “Just one spark that goes out from your bellows burns all of it.” Likewise, Yaakov saw all the chiefs [of Eisov] that are enumerated above. he wondered and said: “Who is it that could vanquish them all?” What is written later? “This the history of Yaakov, Yoseif.” For it is written: “The House of Yaakov shall be a fire and the House of Yoseif a flame and the House of Eisov straw.” [I.e.,] a spark will go out from Yoseif and consume them all. From an old edition of Rashi.) "
Genesis 38:1,"1At that time. Why is this narrative [of Yehudah] placed here, thereby interrupting the narrative of Yoseif? This is to teach that his brothers demoted him from his important position. When they saw the anguish of their father they said, “You advised us to sell him. Had you advised us to return him we would have listened to you.” He turned away. From his brothers. Until [he came to] a man, an Adullamite. He had become his business-partner. "
Genesis 39:1,"1Yoseif was brought down. [Scripture now] returns to the earlier narrative, but only interrupted it to relate Yehudah’s descent [from power] to the selling of Yoseif, in order to indicate that it was because of him [Yoseif] that they demoted him [Yehudah] from his high position. Also, in order to relate the narrative of Potiphar’s wife to the narrative of Tamar, in order to indicate to you that just as this one [Tamar acted] with pure motives so, too, the other one [Potiphar’s wife] acted with pure motives. She had seen in her astrological signs that she was destined to have children [descended] from him, but she did not know whether it would be from her or whether from her daughter."
Genesis 40:1,"1After these events. Because that cursed woman made it a habit that this righteous man be a topic of conversation to all, to speak about him and to demean him, God brought about the offenses of these [people] so that their attention be diverted to these [people] and not to him [Yoseif]. Also, to bring about a respite to the righteous man through their doings. An offense was committed. Concerning one, a fly was found in his cup of aromatic beverage while a pebble was found in the bread of the other. And baker. Of the bread of the king. The term אַפִיָה—baking—applies only to bread. In Old French it is pestor [baker]. "
Genesis 41:1,"1It was at the end. As Onkelos translates it, “At the end,” and every form of the word קֵץ means “the end.”On the bank of the river. All other rivers are not referred to as יְאוֹרִים except for the Nile, because the entire country [Egypt] is made up of man-made canals [יְאוֹרִים] and the Nile overflows into them [the canals] and fills them with water, since rain does not fall regularly in Egypt as [it does] in other lands. "
Genesis 42:1,"1Yaakov saw that food was being sold in Egypt. But, how did he see it? Certainly he did not see it, but only heard it, as is written: “Behold, I have heard, etc.” Then, why does it say: “He saw”? He saw a holy indistinct vision that his hope [שֶׁבֶר] is in Egypt. This was not an actual prophecy to explicitly tell him that this was Yoseif. Why would you have everyone gazing at you? “Why do you show yourselves before the Yishmaelites and Children of Eisov as though you are satiated?” For at that time they still had grain. To me it seems that the plain meaning of לָמָה תִּתְרָאוּ is: “Why would you have everyone gazing at you and wondering why you do not seek food for yourselves before what you have is totally consumed?” I have heard from others that it [תִּתְרָאוּ] is a term for leanness; [i.e.,] “Why should you become lean through hunger?” This is similar to: “He who satisfies others shall himself be satisfied.” "
Genesis 43:2,"2When they had finished eating. Yehudah had told them, “Wait for the old man, until all the bread of the house has been consumed.” When they had finished. [The correct version of Onkelos for כַּאֲשֶׁר כִּלּוּ is] כַּד שֵׁצִיאוּ. The version of the Targum which renders it כַּד סַפִּיקוּ is mistaken. “When the camels had ended drinking” is translated by Onkelos as כַּד סַפִּיקוּ—meaning that they had drunk their fill, for that was the end of their drinking. But, here, “when they had finished eating,” means when the food was entirely consumed, which is translated כַּד שֵׁצִיאוּ. "
Genesis 44:2,"2My goblet. [גְבִיעַ] is a tall goblet, which is called maderne in O.F."
Genesis 45:1,1Yoseif could not contain his emotions in the presence of all who stood. He could not bear that the Egyptians standing by him would hear his brothers’ humiliation when he would make himself known to them. 
Genesis 46:1,"1To Beer Sheva. [בְּאֵרָה שָּׁבַע] is the same as לִבְאֵר שָׁבַע. The suffix ה' replaces the prefix ל'. To the God of his father Yitzchok. A person must honor his father more than he must honor his grandfather. Therefore, he associated [the sacrifices] with Yitzchok and not with Avraham. "
Genesis 47:2,"2From among his brothers. From the least strong among them, who do not [even] appear strong, for if he [Pharaoh] would find them strong he might induct them into his military. These [weaker ones] were: Reuvain, Shimon, Leivi, Yissachar and Binyomin, those whose names Moshe did not repeat when he blessed them. But, the names of the strong ones he repeated: “And this is for Yehudah—hear, God, the voice of Yehudah.” “And about Gad he said, ‘Blessed be He that extends Gad.’” “And about Naphtali he said, ‘Naphtali.’” “And about Dan he said, ‘Dan.’” And so, too, concerning Zevulun. And so, too, concerning Asher. The above is quoted from Bereishis Rabbah which is the Aggadah of the Land of Israel. But, in our Babylonian Talmud we find that those whose names Moshe repeated were the weak ones and those were the ones he [Yoseif] brought before Pharaoh. And the fact that Yehudah’s name is repeated± - it is not repeated due to his being weak—but there is a reason for this as is mentioned in Bava Kamma. In the Berayso of the Sifrei we have the version—in [the portion of] V’zos Haberachah—that is the same as our Talmud [in Bava Kamma.]"
Genesis 48:1,"1Someone said to Yoseif. [“Someone” refers to] one of the tellers of events, this being an elliptical verse. Others say: Ephraim was frequently with Yaakov for study, and when Yaakov took ill in the Land of Goshen, Ephraim went to his father in Egypt to tell him. He took his two sons with him. So that Yaakov might bless them before his death. "
Genesis 49:1,1And I will tell you. He wished to reveal the End [of the exile] and the Divine Presence departed from him and he began speaking of other things. 
Genesis 50:2,2To embalm his father. [Embalming] involves using aromatic spices.
