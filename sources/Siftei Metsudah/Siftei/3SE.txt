@p1[1]@p2<TIE>And all commands a calling preceded.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Why is it written @hh<HEB>ויקרא@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>וידבר@ee<ENG>, which is apparently redundant? Therefore, he explains: [For all “speakings” and all sayings and all commands a calling preceded] .<TIE>.<TIE>. meaning: Hashem did not speak to Moshe abruptly, but first He greeted him with “Moshe, Moshe” and he would answer “Here I am,” and then He would speak with him. @d1A calling, an expression of love.@p3 [All the “speakings,” etc.] in the Tent of Meeting were preceded by a calling. That is to say, from here we learn through a @hh<HEB>בנין אב@ee<ENG> (by comparison) that whenever it says, @hh<HEB>וידבר@ee<ENG>, @hh<HEB>ויאמר@ee<ENG>, or @hh<HEB>צו@ee<ENG>, it was preceded by calling. This is so in the case of @hh<HEB>דיבור@ee<ENG> as explained here. @hh<HEB>אמירה@ee<ENG>: as it is written in Parshas Shemos (3:4): “Elohim @ITcalled@it to him from the midst of the thorn-bush, and @ITsaid@it (@hh<HEB>ויאמר@ee<ENG>).” @hh<HEB>ציווי@ee<ENG>: as it is written in Parshas Yisro (19:20): “And Adonoy @ITcalled@it to Moshe to come up to the top of the mountain .<TIE>.<TIE>. [Adonoy] said .<TIE>.<TIE>. ‘Go down and warn the people<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.’ This is an expression of @hh<HEB>ציווי@ee<ENG>: Lest they break through toward Hashem to see. However, there remains a difficulty: Why did Rashi not give this explanation above in Parshas Shemos or Yisro; why did he leave it until now? (@ITMinchas Yaakov@it and @ITNachalas Yaakov@it). @d1Happenstance and uncleanness.@p3 Meaning: @hh<HEB>ויקרא@ee<ENG> is related to the word @hh<HEB>קרי@ee<ENG>, as in nocturnal emission.<FJ> [You might ask:] The word @hh<HEB>ויקר@ee<ENG> refers to Hashem! [The answer is:] It seemed to Hashem, as it were, as if He contracted repulsiveness and impurity in speaking to Bilaam, as one who contracts repulsiveness through nocturnal emission. @d1And reaches his ears.@p3 This refers to the utterance “Moshe, Moshe,” as is, with the pronunciation of the letters. All of these are needed [i.e., the three exclusions that Rashi mentions: 1)<TIE>This one, “And He called to Moshe,” which excludes all Israel, 2)<TIE>“and Adonoy spoke @ITto him@it,” to exclude Aharon, and 3)<TIE>“the voice to him (@hh<HEB>אליו@ee<ENG> instead of @hh<HEB>לו@ee<ENG>),” Moshe heard but all Israel did not hear], for if only one of these was written we would have established it [as excluding] only Israel. And if it was only written: “And He called to Moshe and [Adonoy] spoke to him,” [without the exclusion 3)] I would have thought that Aharon and all of Israel heard the @ITsound@it of Hashem’s utterance. If it was only written: “And He called to Moshe and he heard the sound,” [without exclusion 2)] I would have thought Aharon heard even the speech itself. If was written: “Adonoy spoke to him,” and also: “He heard the voice,” together, [without exclusion 1)], I would have thought Aharon heard even the speech itself and all of Israel heard the call, “Moshe, Moshe” (This is the essence of Re”m’s words). @d1Perhaps even for the breaks.@p3 I.e., in a place where there is a parshah-break but there is not [at the beginning of the next parshah an expression of] @hh<HEB>דבור@ee<ENG>, @hh<HEB>אמירה@ee<ENG>, or @hh<HEB>ציווי@ee<ENG>, for example, the breaks preceding (v. 10): “If his offering is from flocks of sheep,” (v. 14): “If his burnt-offering is of fowl,” and (2:1): “When a person brings,” and the like. You might ask: Why did Rashi not ask this “Perhaps even [for the breaks<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.]” after stating, “God happened upon Bilaam”? The answer is: Above, it was all right because I would have thought that everyone, including Israel, heard the voice of Hashem. If so, it did not indicate that Moshe was greater than the rest of Israel, for they also heard, as Moshe did. Thus, it was obvious there was a calling even for the breaks, for the fact he was called even for the breaks was the greatness of Moshe over the rest of Israel. But now that Rashi explains that Moshe alone heard the calling voice, one could be in doubt if he also had the greatness of being called for the breaks or not, because he was greater than the rest of Israel even without this, for the people of Israel did not even hear the calling voice. Thus, “the verse states @d1The verse states, “He spoke.”@p3 [Rashi is answering the question: Why does it say: “And He called @ITto@it (@hh<HEB>אל@ee<ENG>) Moshe”?] You might ask: In the entire Torah it is written, “Adonoy spoke @ITto@it Moshe, saying<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Why did Rashi not ask this before? The answer is: Here, Hashem called, “Moshe, Moshe,” if so, [it should have said: “And He called Moshe,”] why is it written @hh<HEB>אל@ee<ENG>? Rather [it is saying:] “The voice proceeds<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” However, Re”m explains that Rashi is answering the question: Why is it written @hh<HEB>אל משה@ee<ENG>, it should say simply @hh<HEB>למשה@ee<ENG>? To this Rashi comments: “The voice proceeds<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Rashi responds here more than from every other place it says @hh<HEB>אל@ee<ENG> in the Torah because in Toras Kohanim the Sages expounded that @hh<HEB>וידבר @HBאליו@HB@ee<ENG> comes to exclude Aharon from the actual words of the command. But how did they derive that? Perhaps it only comes to exclude Israel, but Aharon, who was appointed to speak, did hear! Rather, perforce we must say that there was a previous “exclusion,” which is the word @hh@HB<HEB>אל@hh משה@ee<ENG> that excludes all Israel, that they did not hear it, and they did not even hear the call “Moshe, Moshe.” This is because [the word @hh<HEB>אל@ee<ENG>] refers to the verb “He called.” So much more so [that Israel did not hear] the actual words of the One Who is commanding. Thus, the extra word @hh<HEB>אליו@ee<ENG> remains [available] to exclude Aharon from [hearing] the explicit words, and the drashah @hh<HEB>קול לו@ee<ENG> excludes all of them, even from the @ITsound@it of the calling. @d1To give a breathing space.@p3 It is understandable if this was a new calling or prophecy — that is why there is a break. But if there was no calling, why is there a break? Rashi answers: “To give a breathing space<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @d1How much more so for an ordinary person.@p3 The main point is to teach us who learn from ordinary persons that we must allow for a break between one subject and another in order to reflect between one and the other. @d1To exclude.@p3 Meaning: the speaking was specifically to Moshe alone. Rashi is saying that to exclude Israel does not need an extra word, because it is [already] written @hh<HEB>אל@ee<ENG>, which excludes Israel. Rather, [the extra word] @hh<HEB>אליו@ee<ENG> comes to exclude Aharon. @d1Rabbi Yehudoh ben Beseiro says: Thirteen<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 It appears to me that there is no disagreement. It is only that Rabbi Yehudoh explains the words of the Tanna Kamma, so that you will not understand @hh<HEB>אליו@ee<ENG> comes here to exclude Aharon from the “speaking,” regarding the command: “If his offering is a burnt-offering.” This is because an extra word is not needed here to exclude him, since Aharon is not mentioned. Rather, it should be applied to the verses where Aharon is mentioned, which are the thirteen places. The text in Toras Kohanim follows this understanding as well: “Said Rabbi Yehudoh<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” It seems to me Re”m wrote unnecessarily at length about this (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it). @d1Perhaps they heard.@p3 Many trouble themselves to explain why Rashi writes this matter here and not before the comment: @hh<HEB>אליו@ee<ENG> — to exclude Aharon. In my humble opinion the matters are straightforward: Rashi’s comments here are dependent on each other. The main reason to differentiate between “calling” and “speaking” is based on the thirteen exclusions, which are the thirteen “speakings” in which Moshe and Aharon are mentioned. These are specifically in regard to speaking and not to the “sound of calling.” Thus, we could have possibly thought the entire people of Israel actually heard the calling, for there is no exclusion concerning this by Aharon. If so, the entire people of Israel are equal to Aharon in this matter, and Aharon would have no advantage over Israel in this matter. This is because it is based on the extra word @hh<HEB>אליו@ee<ENG>, and Aharon is excluded together with the entire people of Israel. Therefore, we would have thought this applies only to “speaking,” but not in regard to “the sound of calling.” Thus, it says: [Instead of] “the voice to him (@hh<HEB>לו@ee<ENG>),” [it states] “the voice to him (@hh<HEB>אליו@ee<ENG>).” Meaning: In the verse at the end of Parshas Nosso it is written (Bamidbar 7:89): “When Moses would come into the Tent of Meeting [to speak with Him,] he would hear the voice speaking to him.” It would have been possible to say: @hh<HEB>קול מדבר @hh@HBלו@ee<ENG>, but it is written: @hh<HEB>מדבר @hh@HBאליו@ee<ENG>, for the sake of expounding this drashah: The entire people of Israel did not hear, thus, Aharon also did not hear, for they were already equated together, as we mentioned (@ITDivrei Dovid@it). @d1“The voice to him (@HB<HEB>לו@ee@BO<ENG>),” “the voice to him (@HB<HEB>אליו@BO<ENG>).”@p3 I.e., Scripture should have written: @hh<HEB>קול לו@ee<ENG>, why is it written @hh<HEB>קול אליו@ee<ENG>? It must be: “Moshe heard but all Israel did not hear.” I.e., it is obvious that Israel did not hear, for they did not even hear the calling, for their exclusion was expounded from the phrase: @hh@HB<HEB>אל@hh משה@ee<ENG>. So much more so that they did not hear the “speaking.” Rather, this teaches about Aharon, and refers back to the words of Rabbi Yehudoh ben Beseiro there, in which Aharon was excluded by expounding the extra word @hh<HEB>אליו@ee<ENG>, even in a place where it is written: “@hh<HEB>אל משה ואל אהרן@ee<ENG>.” Rashi raises a difficulty on this: Perhaps he heard the @ITsound@it of the speaking, though not the exact letters? [Therefore, it says: (Instead of) “the voice to him (@hh<HEB>לו@ee<ENG>),” (it states) “the voice to him (@hh<HEB>אליו@ee<ENG>)” — even the @ITsound@it of the speaking he did not hear] @eeand it excludes even Aharon with the extra word @hh<HEB>אליו@ee<ENG>. So Re”m explains. @d1And did not leave the tent.@p3 It is not written: “And He called to Moshe from the Tent of Meeting and [Adonoy] spoke to him.” It must be that the reason it is written: “[Spoke] to him from the Tent of Meeting,” i.e. [placing the phrase “from the Tent of Meeting” next to the words] “to him” must be [in order to convey that] the voice was heard by Moshe, because he was in the Tent of Meeting, but it was not heard outside of the Tent (@ITRe”m@it). @eeThis does not appear to me to be correct. Rather, Rashi derives [that this verse is also speaking about the voice’s range] for if you would assume that it is only referring to the place from where the voice originated, it should say: “From between the two cherubim,” as the Toras Kohanim concludes. But since it is written, “From the Tent of Meeting,” perforce it also refers to the voice’s range (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it). @eeHowever, this poses a difficulty: If so, why is the extra word @hh<HEB>אליו@ee<ENG> needed to exclude that Moshe heard and all of Israel did not hear? It is obvious that they did not hear, since the people of Israel were standing outside of the Tent! The Ra’avad answers that the exclusion is needed [for the period] before the Tabernacle was erected (@ITRe”m@it). @d1For we find.@p3 The expression “for we find” is not meant to be precise, for the sending of the spies was only after Nissan of the second year and the Tabernacle’s establishment was on the first of Nissan of the second year from the Exodus of Israel from Egypt. Rather, perforce, we must say that the expression “for we find” only comes to give an example of what is meant by sobering words (@ITRe”m@it). @eeHowever, I say that this is what it means: Hashem commanded Moshe to tell them: “It is for your sake that He speaks to me.” These were the sobering words and no more. The authors of the Midrash that bring proofs for their statement that Hashem speaks to the prophets only for the sake of Israel: “For we find<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” In the same way, the Mechilta dwells on this at length (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it). @d1And answer Me whether they will accept them.@p3 You might ask: How could it be that Hashem would not know whether or not they will accept them? The answer is: It is for this reason Rashi brings a proof: “As it is stated<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” There, Rashi explains that it is the proper mode of conduct to speak in such a way, and Scripture only comes to teach you correct manners. @p1[2]@p2<TIE>Voluntary sacrifices.@p3 You might ask: Perhaps it is speaking about an obligatory burnt offering! Re”m answers: Perforce, the word @hh<HEB>כי@ee<ENG> means “if” and not “that.” [If it meant “that,”] it is as if it says: Because he shall bring an offering to Hashem, which means, “because I admonished you to bring an offering to Hashem, I am telling you to bring it from the cattle, etc.” However, this is not applicable unless the sacrifices were mentioned before elsewhere. Sacrifices, though, were not mentioned in anywhere before. Therefore, it is only possible to explain that @hh<HEB>כי@ee<ENG> means “if.” See Re”m’s explanation there, because he goes on at length. @eeIt seems to me that since it is written, “You should bring your offering,” in the plural form, “you” teaches that two [people] may volunteer a burnt-offering in partnership. Perforce, this is referring to a voluntary offering, for if it refers to an obligatory offering, how could two people bring such an offering in partnership, when each one is obligated to bring an offering? Rather, perforce, it refers to a voluntary offering (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it). @d1Why is this said?@p3 It should say @hh<HEB>איש@ee<ENG>. Above [before Rashi explains that the section speaks of voluntary sacrifices], however, it did not pose a difficulty, because I could say @hh<HEB>אדם@ee<ENG> comes to exclude an idolater, as we derive: “You are termed @hh<HEB>אדם@ee<ENG> but idolaters are not.” Now, though, that Rashi explains @hh<HEB>אדם כי יקריב@ee<ENG> speaks of a voluntary offering, and an idolater is permitted to bring a voluntary offering, as we derive from the extra words @hh<HEB>איש איש כי יקריב @ee<ENG> — [from which we learn that] idolaters are included in bringing voluntary offerings. [Therefore, now it is difficult:] Why does it say @hh<HEB>אדם@ee<ENG>? (@ITKitzur Mizrachi@it). @eeHowever, this is not true, for if so, what shall you say it means in Parshas Tazria where it is written: “@hh@HB<HEB>אדם@hh כי יהיה בעור בשרו@ee<ENG>”? Why does it not say @hh<HEB>איש@ee<ENG>? Furthermore, when we look at what Rashi quotes [in the first d.h.]: “@hh<HEB>אדם כי יקריב מכם@ee<ENG>,” this is apparently unnecessary. First, he should quote @hh<HEB>אדם@ee<ENG> and explain it, and afterwards quote @hh<HEB>כי יקריב מכם@ee<ENG> and then explain it. Rather, Rashi’s intention is to explain the double expression @hh<HEB>אדם מכם@ee<ENG>, for it would be sufficient to say just @hh<HEB>אדם כי יקריב@ee<ENG> or simply @hh<HEB>כי יקריב מכם@ee<ENG>. Since Rashi wishes to explain this problem, which is based on the phrase’s beginning and end, i.e., the double expression, he felt it was best to first explain @hh<HEB>כי יקריב@ee<ENG> which appears first — that it refers to a voluntary offering — before he explains the later word @hh<HEB>מכם@ee<ENG>, which is a repetition of @hh<HEB>אדם@ee<ENG>, for one of them is extra. Therefore, he explains first @hh<HEB>כי יקריב@ee<ENG>, which comes first in the verse, and afterwards @hh<HEB>אדם@ee<ENG>, since the problem is based on the word @hh<HEB>מכם@ee<ENG>, which comes later. One who wishes to make the difficulty presented by the word @hh<HEB>אדם@ee<ENG> dependent on the phrase @hh<HEB>כי יקריב@ee<ENG> is just making an unnecessary pilpul (@ITDivrei Dovid@it). @d1So should you not bring from stolen property.@p3 As it is written (Yeshayahu 61:8): “[For I am Hashem, Who loves justice,] hates robbery in a burnt offering.” @d1Perhaps even wild animals.@p3 [You might think this] because wild animals (@hh<HEB>חיה@ee<ENG>) are included in the term @hh<HEB>בהמה@ee<ENG>, as it is written (11:2): “These are the living things (@hh<HEB>החיה@ee<ENG>) that you may eat from among all the animals (@hh<HEB>הבהמה@ee<ENG>)” (@ITRe”m@it). @eeIn Toras Kohanim [the following verse is used to support the assumption]: As it says (Devarim 14:4-5): “These are the animals (@hh<HEB>הבהמה@ee<ENG>) that you may eat: [ox, lamb,] and kid, @ITgazelle, deer@it<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” which is a verse in Parshas Re’eh, and this is the text cited in Zevachim 34a as well (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it). @d1The verse teaches us: Cattle.@p3 I.e., why is it written: “Cattle or sheep,” since the word @hh<HEB>בהמה@ee<ENG> means cattle and sheep unless specified otherwise? Rather, it comes to exclude: Specifically cattle and sheep, but not wild animals. @d1[A male animal] which was with a woman.@p3 You might ask: Why does it need to exclude these animals, since they are stoned to death? The answer is: [It is needed,] where [it was known only] by the testimony of one witness, or the owner admitted, in which case the animal is not stoned. Therefore, it is needed to exclude them. Similarly, we must say [regarding Rashi’s comment later] concerning the animal that was worshipped as an idol or the ox that killed a man. @d1Which was worshipped.@p3 Concerning the animal that was with a woman it says @hh<HEB>בהמה@ee<ENG> (20:15): “A man who lies [conjugally] with an animal (@hh<HEB>בבהמה@ee<ENG>),” whereas concerning the animal that was worshipped it is written (Tehillim 106:20): “They exchanged their glory for the likeness of an @ITox@it eating grass.” The verse here speaks of a @ITliving@it animal that was worshipped, which is permitted for secular use and is not forbidden as an animal that was worshipped as an idol or as an animal that was set aside as an offering to an idol, as it says in Temurah (28b). @d1Set aside [as an offering to an idol].@p3 Meaning: [An animal] set aside and separated for idolatry should not be brought as an offering. This refers to the case when they fed it fodder of idolatry, but with a statement alone [it would] not [be considered as set aside], as it says in Temurah 29a. @d1To exclude a goring ox.@p3 Meaning: Specifically, an animal that killed a man, not that it killed another animal. @d1[An animal] with a fatal defect.@p3 This refers to the case where the animal was fit at the time the owner consecrated it, and then it became fatally defective. If so, I might have thought it is permissible for one to sacrifice it on the altar since it was fit at the time he consecrated it. Thus, it is necessary to exclude it here. @d1That two [people] may volunteer.@p3 Otherwise, it should say: @hh<HEB>יקריב קרבנו@ee<ENG> [in the singular form instead of in the plural form]. This does not mean only two, but rather ten, a hundred, or a thousand [and it is still considered an individual’s offering and requires leaning] as long as the entire people of Israel are not partners in it [as we find, for example, with the burnt offerings of the “summer fruit” for the altar which comes from the surplus of the yearly half-shekels]. @d1“Summer fruit” for the altar.@p3 I.e., a “meal” for the altar that comes from the surplus, i.e., the surplus from the half-shekels given the previous year. From those surplus half-shekels they bought sheep as burnt offerings and sacrificed them on the altar when there were no individual offerings to bring, so that the altar would not be unused, without any sacrifices being offered.<QC>
@p1[3]@p2<TIE>It comes only to say — a male.@p3 Rashi brings here the exclusion from “a male” (v. 10) — not [an animal] whose sex cannot be determined and the one which has both male and female characteristics — and not the rest of the exclusions later on [such as an old or sick animal], because he explains in the next comment: “@hh<HEB>תמים@ee<ENG>. Without a blemish.” [Rashi does this] so that you will not raise the objection: How does he know that @hh<HEB>תמים@ee<ENG> means without a blemish? Perhaps @hh<HEB>תמים@ee<ENG> means that it should be perfect in its quality, i.e., it should not be [an animal] whose sex cannot be determined or one which has both male and female characteristics? Therefore, Rashi brings [the drashah] from “a male” later on, where it excludes — “a male,” and not [an animal] whose sex cannot be determined or one which has both male and female characteristics. Thus, as a matter of course, @hh<HEB>תמים@ee<ENG> means “without blemish.” @d1Without a blemish.@p3 Re”m writes: Even though it is written in another place (22:20): “Anything that has a blemish on it you shall not bring,” and if so, why does it say [here] @hh<HEB>תמים@ee<ENG>? The Sages already answered in Toras Kohanim: This word @hh<HEB>תמים@ee<ENG> comes for a @IThekeish@it (comparison). I.e., just as when the animal is blemished and not @hh<HEB>תמים@ee<ENG> it will not be accepted favorably, as it is written (ibid.): “Anything that has a blemish on it [you shall not bring, for it will not be accepted favorably for you],” so too, if it is not a male, but rather a female, one whose sex cannot be determined, or one which has both male and female characteristics, it will not be accepted favorably.<QC>
@d1Until the court.@p3 The word @hh<HEB>יקריבנו@ee<ENG> is from the root of @hh<HEB>קורבה@ee<ENG>, which means to bring close. Rashi’s proof is [that otherwise,] why does it say, “[He shall bring an unblemished male] to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting”? It should write: “An unblemished male he shall bring to be accepted favorably before Hashem,” and no more. @d1Even if [Reuvein’s burnt-offering] became mixed up [with Shimon’s].@p3 Meaning: Scripture could have written: “He shall bring it .<TIE>.<TIE>. to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting that it be favorably accepted from him before Adonoy.” [Why does it say “he shall bring it” a second time?] Without Rashi’s explanation that [the one who brings the sacrifice] takes care of it until [it is brought to] the [Temple] courts, I might have thought [that the first “he shall bring it” is needed for the plain meaning, to teach that he should not slaughter it outside the courtyard and] the extra “he shall bring it” teaches that he takes care of it even @ITinside@it the court. However, now that Rashi explains that he is only obligated to take care of it until the entrance to the courtyard, why does it need [to repeat] “he shall bring it”? @d1Unfit.@p3 Meaning: Such as [a male animal] which was with a woman or a [female] animal which was with a man, and the like. @d1Or of another kind.@p3 With a sin-offering, guilt-offering, first-born, animal tithes, Pesach offering, or peace offering. @d1That they force.@p3 This is not derived from the repetition of @hh<HEB>יקריב@ee<ENG>, because that is needed to include the law when a burnt-offering became mixed up with another burnt-offering, or a burnt-offering became mixed up with a common [animal]. Rather, this is derived from the extra word @hh<HEB>אותו@ee<ENG>. @d1Against his will? The verse comes only to say: @HB<HEB>לרצונו@ee<ENG>. I.e., you might think that if they forced him to buy [an animal] to bring as the sacrifice and he cries out the whole time that he does not want to do it — even so — he must do it against his will. Therefore, the verse comes to say: @hh<HEB>לרצונו@ee<ENG>, they force him until he says, “I want to.” Then, he brings it. We should not ask: What does this statement help, since he says it against his will? [The answer is:] We say that because he was forced he decided to agree with what he is saying out loud, because he wants to be rid of being forced. Even regarding monetary issues we say this (Baba Basra 47b): Rav Huna said: If they hung him up until he agreed to sell to him, the acquisition has been made, because due to his being forced he decided to transfer his ownership; so much more so here where it is a mitzvah (@ITDivrei Dovid@it). @d1There is no laying [of the hands] at a private altar.@p3 The verse (4) [“and he shall lay his hand”] is interpreted in juxtaposition to the preceding section and to the section following: “Before God,” which refers to the Tent of Meeting, where the Ark and the Divine Presence are found. @p1[4]@p2<TIE>For laying (of hands).@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Why does it say, “[on the head of] the burnt-offering”? [It should say “on @ITits@it head,”] because at the verse’s beginning it is written “burnt-offering” to which the verse is referring. Rather, it comes to include everything that is termed a burnt-offering for laying [of the hands], even an obligatory burnt-offering. And since it is written “@ITthe@it burnt-offering” with the indicative @hh<HEB>ה@ee<ENG>, this implies [only] the burnt-offering that was mentioned: “From cattle or from sheep,” and to exclude a bird [offered as a] burnt-offering from laying [of the hands]; and to include a sheep [brought as] a burnt-offering, i.e., also for laying [of hands]. @d1A prohibition which is uprooted by a positive commandment.@p3 For instance (Devarim 22:6): “You shall not take the mother upon the young,” upon which it is written (Ibid. 7): “You shall send away the mother.” Similarly (Shemos 12:10): “You must not leave any of it over until morning. Any of it left over until morning must be burned in fire.” Also (Vayikro 19:13): “And you shall not rob,” upon which it is written (Ibid. 5:23): “He shall return the stolen property.” No punishment is mentioned with regard to these prohibitions, but the prohibitions mentioned by Rashi have their punishments specified, whether committed intentionally where there is execution ordered by a court or being whipped, or when committed unintentionally where there is a sin-offering. @p1[5]@p2<TIE>Valid by a non-@BIkohein.@bi@p3 Since it is written “he shall slaughter” without specifying who slaughters, and afterwards it is written: “The @ITkohanim@it shall bring,” this implies that the slaughter is valid even when done by a non@ITkohein@it. The explanation is: If you would think that receiving [the blood] is permitted by a non-@ITkohein@it, and it is a mitzvah of the Kohanim [only] from carrying and onwards, and accordingly, “they shall bring” means carrying, then it should mention receiving together with slaughtering before the phrase, “and the sons of Aharon will bring.” Since it did not mention it there, perforce that “they shall bring” means receiving (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it). This is the explanation: Certainly, this word “they shall bring” refers to receiving, since we cannot say it refers to carrying because carrying is not necessarily a Temple service, for if the animal was slaughtered close enough to the altar that no carrying would be needed, then surely no carrying need to be done. If so, we must say that “they shall bring” is receiving, which is an indispensable mitzvah. However, why does Scripture use the expression “they shall bring”? Rather, it implies carrying as well, and we [therefore] learn that both [receiving and carrying] require a @ITkohein@it (@ITGur Aryeh@it). @d1In the court.@p3 But not in the Tent of Meeting, for if [Scripture wants to specify a location that is even holier than the entrance to the Tent, or the Temple courts,] it should have written: “Before Hashem, in front of the Ark-cover,” or “Before Hashem, at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.” @d1An expression of carrying.@p3 I.e., although [“they shall bring”] literally means carrying [the blood] to the altar, nevertheless, since the receiving of the blood [in a vessel] is the first act after slaughtering and precedes carrying, perforce, we must explain [“they shall bring”] as referring to the receiving. We learn carrying [requires a Kohein] as well through a kal vachomer [@ITRe”m@it]. @d1Perhaps those unfit? The verse says:@p3 You might ask: [If so,] let it not say “the sons of Aharon”? The Sages already answered in the Gemoro: Perhaps I should exclude those unfit and not those with a blemish? The verse says: “The sons of Aharon” — just as Aharon is valid because he is unblemished, so too, his sons are valid<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. However, [you might ask:] In Parshas Emor we include those with a blemish from the verse: “[the sons of Aharon]”? See Minchas Yaakov who answers. You might ask: Why do I need a verse to invalidate those with a blemish, you can derive it from what is written (21:18): “For any man who has a blemish [shall not approach]”? The answer is: There, it refers to the service on the altar, as it is written: (Ibid. 21): “Shall not approach to offer the fireofferings of Adonoy.” But here it includes receiving [the blood] and all the rest of the service. Alternatively, it informs that he transgresses on a positive commandment and a negative commandment, for this is what it implies: “The sons of Aharon” — just as Aharon is unblemished, so too every unblemished @ITkohein@it is permitted to bring, [but a blemished @ITkohein@it is not permitted to bring]. A negative commandment that is derived by implication from a positive commandment is considered a positive commandment. Thus, it informs us that he transgresses a negative commandment and a positive one (@ITGur Aryeh@it). @d1Which was mixed with [other blood of its type or of another type].@p3 “Of its type” means [for example that] the blood of Reuven’s burnt-offering [that was mixed] with the blood of Shimon’s burnt-offering. “Or of another type” [refers to] the blood of a burnt-offering [which was mixed] with the blood of an exchanged offering or with the blood of a guilt-offering or with the blood of any sacrifice whose blood is sprinkled below the red line, such as the blood of a burnt-offering. There is no problem since they are all sprinkled below the red line. [You might ask:] The blood of the burnt-offering requires two applications [of the blood by sprinkling] that are four [in direction], and some of the other [types of] blood require only one application? This is no problem, for he may place all the blood in one application. However, the opposite is not true, because some of the [types of] blood require only one application, and [by placing more than one application] he would transgress the negative commandment of “do not add [to the mitzvos].” @d1“Inner” sin-offerings.@p3 Their blood is sprinkled on the inner Holy Curtain and on the inner altar. @d1“Outer” sin-offerings.@p3 Their blood is sprinkled on the outer altar. @d1Where these, [the inner ones, require sprinkling] above.@p3 Meaning: Above the red line.<QC>
@d1“Its blood.”@p3 Meaning: This excludes the case where its blood was mixed with the blood of an inner or outer sin-offering. What should he do if the blood was mixed? He should spill it into the amoh (the drainage ditch in the courtyard). Similarly, if blood that is sprinkled above the red line was mixed with blood that is sprinkled below he should spill it into the amoh as well. @d1Stands below.@p3 Meaning: on the ground and not on the ramp. @d1Two applications that are four.@p3 Meaning: The sprinkling is from the vessel in which the @ITkohein@it received the blood, and he sprinkles on the altar’s wall opposite the edge of the altar’s northeastern corner. The blood spreads on the corner’s two directions like a Greek “@ggÃ@gg@ee” (@ITgamma@it) which is like our @hh<HEB>ך@ee<ENG> that is inverted. Then, he goes to the southwestern corner, diagonally opposite, and sprinkles from the vessel towards the edge of the corner like a “@ggÃ@gg@ee.” Thus, with these two applications, one on the northeastern corner and one on the southwestern corner, the sprinkled blood appears on four directions of the altar. This is what is meant by “all around.” @d1Not when it is taken apart.@p3 Otherwise, why does it say: “The entrance of the Tent of Meeting”? Above, it is already written: “The entrance of the Tent of Meeting”!<QC>
@p1[6]@p2<TIE>To include all the burnt-offerings.@p3 Meaning: The section is [already] referring to a burntoffering; Scripture should have said: He shall skin @ITit@it<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. Rather: [To include all the burntofferings]; it makes no difference if it is a burnt offering of women, converts, or slaves. The @hh<HEB>ה@ee<ENG> of @hh<HEB>העולה@ee<ENG> excludes [the case] when it was slaughtered [with intention to eat it] beyond its [prescribed] time or [with intention to eat it] outside of its [prescribed] place (pigul), or any other invalid offerings, and it went up on the altar [without being skinned]; it should not be taken down [from the altar]. Instead, they burn it with its skin, and it does not need skinning. @d1But not its pieces<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 In the second chapter of Yoma the Gemara explains how the pieces were cut. @p1[7]@p2<TIE>It is a mitzvoh to bring [some fire].@p3 This does not mean that the fire descended every day, but rather the fire that descended in the days of Moshe did not depart from the altar until the Jewish people came to the Eternal House (First Temple). Then, a fire descended from Heaven in Shlomo [HaMelech]’s building, and it did not depart until the days of Menashe, as [the Sages] taught [in a Baraisa] at the end of the first chapter of Yoma. @d1In his role as @BIkohein godol.@bi@p3 Otherwise, why does it say “the @ITkohein@it”? Similarly, why does it say: “the sons of Aharon the Kohein”? If [you say] it comes to exclude the unfit @ITkohanim@it, [that cannot be,] for the verse already excluded them from receiving the blood, which is the first step in sprinkling the blood, so much more so [they are excluded] from the rest of the service that follows! Rather, it tells you that the entire service of the @ITkohein godol@it should be in the way of a @ITkohein godol@it, and that [the entire service] of an ordinary @ITkohein@it should be in the way of an ordinary @ITkohein@it, i.e., the @ITkohein godol@it wears eight garments and the ordinary @ITkohein@it wears four garments. @p1[8]@p2<TIE>Since it was already cut off.@p3 Once the signs (windpipe and esophagus) were cut, Rashi calls the head “cut off,” because the animal’s life-force depends on them. As a result, it is considered as if it was placed in a basket. The head is not included in skinning, but rather is brought as is with the skin. @d1And covers.@p3 It is understandable for Scripture to mention “the head,” for it is needed to be included, because it had already been cut off and it was not included in the skinning. However, why is it necessary to say “the fat”?<QC>
@d1Protrude.@p3 Meaning: They cut thick pieces of wood that will not protrude outside the pile, which is where they burnt the offerings’ limbs; it is one amoh (cubit) by one amoh. The cut pieces of wood were also one amoh long so they would not protrude outside the pile. This was so the wood would not interfere with the @ITkohanim@it’s feet when they walked around the pile. @p1[9]@p2<TIE>For the sake of a burnt-offering.@p3 Meaning: This excludes [burning it] for the sake of a peace offering. @d1For the sake of the fire.@p3 Meaning: With the intent of burning it completely and not just to roast it there, like pieces of meat roasting on coals. He removes it afterwards, at the time of the removal of the ashes from the altar (@ITRamban@it). @d1Satisfaction before Me.@p3 I.e., it is not that Hashem is pleased by the fragrance of the sacrifice, for it is written (Tehillim 50:12): “If I were hungry I would not tell you<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”<QC>
@p1[10]@p2<TIE>The word “and” adds.@p3 And one learns the previous section from the next section, and the next section from the previous one: Sheep require laying [of the hands], skinning, cutting into pieces, and all the things listed above. @d1Why was there a break.@p3 You might ask: Rashi explains above: Perhaps even for the breaks there was a calling, etc. [to give Moshe a breathing space], therefore, even without the @hh<HEB>ו@ee<ENG> adding to the first matter [we have already learned this]? The answer is: Rashi is saying this only to strengthen the question, i.e., since it says @hh<HEB>ואם@ee<ENG>, which adds to the earlier matter and it is like one parshah — if so, so much more so — why is there a break in the matter? He answers: In order [to give Moshe a breathing space<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.] (@ITRe”m@it). @d1Excluding old.@p3 For if [you say] it excludes [a male animal] which was with a woman or a [female animal] which was with a man, or the other unfit animals excluded above in the beginning of the section — [this cannot be, for] the verse already excludes them above, and the @hh<HEB>ו@ee<ENG> of @hh<HEB>ואם מן הצאן@ee<ENG> comes and adds to the earlier matter, to learn the next section from the previous one. We need not ask: Why are three exclusions [the three extra words @hh<HEB>מן@ee<ENG>] needed? Let us learn [them all] from one! The Sages already answered in the Gemara (Bechoros 41a): If we were to learn from a sick animal with a @hh<HEB>מה מצינו@ee<ENG> (by comparison), I might think that only a sick animal is unfit, because being sick is not inevitable, but an old animal, since it is inevitable [for animals get old] is not unfit. Therefore it lets me know [that even an old animal is unfit]. If [we were to learn] from a filthy animal, I might think that it is [unfit] because it is repulsive, but an old or sick animal [which are not repulsive] are not [unfit]. Therefore, Scripture needed the three exclusions.<QC>
@p1[11]@p2<TIE>On the side.@p3 The side is called “thigh” because the thigh is on the side; similarly (Shemos 26:22): “@hh<HEB>ולירכתי המשכן@ee<ENG> (For the end of the @ITmishkon@it),” (Ibid. 27): “@hh<HEB>לירכתים ימה@ee<ENG> (of the western [back] wall)” — [means] the side.<QC>
@p1[14]@p2<TIE>But not @BIall@BO fowl.@p3 I.e., although a blemished bird is fit [as an offering], nevertheless, a bird lacking a limb is unfit [as an offering]. However, we do not say @hh<HEB>ואם מן העוף@ee<ENG> — the @hh<HEB>ו@ee<ENG> adds [to the previous section] and a bird would be unfit [as an offering] even if it is only blemished, and it needs to be a male. For if so, why does it say “an unblemished male” with regard to sheep? It could have derived the later section [sheep] from the previous section [cattle]. Rather, it comes to exclude [that only regarding cattle and sheep does Scripture require unblemished males, but not regarding birds] (@ITRe”m@it). @d1Large ones.@p3 Otherwise, Scripture should have written @hh<HEB>בני תורים@ee<ENG> as it writes @hh<HEB>בני יונה@ee<ENG>, which refers only to small ones. Rather, [it must mean the large ones]<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. We learn from the expression @hh<HEB>בני יונה@ee<ENG> that there is only one kind [of pigeons] that is fit — specifically small ones — since it is written, @hh<HEB>בני@ee<ENG> (the sons of) — so too, turtledoves, have only one kind that is fit. And we surely cannot say it refers to small ones, as I explained above. If so, it must mean the large ones. @d1Excluding [birds whose feathers] are becoming bright.@p3 I.e., when the feathers start to redden. @p1[15]@p2<TIE>Even one pigeon.@p3 Otherwise, Scripture should have written: “The Kohein shall bring,” why is it written, “He shall bring @ITit@it”? Rather, it teaches that if he comes to bring one pigeon he may do so. [You might ask:] It is written above, “He shall bring from turtledoves<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” which implies two! [The answer is:] That [perhaps it means that this] is the best way to fulfill the mitzvah but not necessary after the fact. Alternatively, “from turtledoves” refers to the species of turtledoves, but [he may bring] even one. @d1With the @BIkohein@bi’s own body.@p3 Otherwise, why does it say “the @ITkohein@it”; [even without specifying a @ITkohein@it,] the nipping must obviously be done by a @ITkohein@it, for a non-@ITkohein@it may not bring sacrifices upon the altar. If not for the verse, I might have thought that nipping must be done with a knife, [and I would have derived it] by means of a @ITkal vachomer@it from slaughtering, which can be done by a non-@ITkohein@it and yet it requires a knife, so much more so nipping, which is invalid for a non-@ITkohein@it — is it not logical that it should require a knife? (Zevachim 65a). @d1Near the nape.@p3 This is derived from the turtledoves and young pigeons spoken about at the end of the parshah, where it is explicitly written (5:8): “opposite of its neck,” i.e., [the part of the neck] that looks upon the nape of the neck, [i.e., behind the throat], but not the nape itself, which is [the back of the head,] on the level of the face and behind it, as it says (Yirmeyahu 2:27): “For they turned to Me their nape and not their face.” @d1After he burns it he squeezes the blood [out the blood].@p3 Meaning: First, he must squeeze out the blood, for the limbs of an offering are brought to be burnt only after the blood is taken out. Thus, it should say “He nips, the blood is squeezed out,” and then, “he burns it.” Rather, the word “burns” is inserted between them [i.e., nipping and squeezing] to make a comparison to “nipping”: [Just as regarding burning, the head is by itself and the body is by itself, so too nipping, the head is by itself and the body is by itself, i.e., the head is completely severed by the nipping. What is the source that the burning of the head and body are separate?] Concerning the burning of its body it is written (17): “[The @ITkohein@it] shall burnt it on the altar,” this speaks [of the burning] of the body. And it is [also] written (v. 15): “Its head and burn it.” [This refers to burning the head]. So too, in regard to nipping, the head is by itself and the body is by itself (Zevachim 65a). @d1So too the nipping.@p3 Although it is still connected by the skin it is considered separated. @d1It is transposed.@p3 As if it is written: “He shall nip its head, [the blood] shall be squeezed out,” and then: “and he shall burn it.” @p1[16]@p2<TIE>The place of excrement; this is the crop.@p3 @hh<HEB>רעי@ee<ENG> means excrement, as in (Nachum 3:6): “@hh<HEB>ושמתיך כראי@ee<ENG> (and I will make you like dung).” In the language of the Sages @hh<HEB>רעי@ee<ENG> is with an @hh<HEB>ע@ee<ENG>, for the @hh<HEB>א@ee<ENG> and the @hh<HEB>ע@ee<ENG> are interchangeable.<QC>
@d1East of the ramp.@p3 [Rashi knows that it is eastward of the @ITramp@it] because Scripture should have written (v. 16): “throw it to the place of the ashes,” and the place of ashes is explained in Parshas Tzav (6:3) that it is beside the altar. Rather, [it must be that] “beside” that is written here refers to the ramp, and “beside” means that the ramp was beside the altar. [This is because] the altar was thirty-two amoh by thirty-two amoh, the ramp’s width was on the altar’s southern side, and the ramp’s width was sixteen amoh and its length thirty-two amoh. The [corner formed by the] rest of the amos in width that remained on the altar’s southern side, where it intersected with the ramp’s eastern side, was where they placed the bird’s crop and the ashes that had been lifted [from the altar]. This is taught in the first chapter of Tamid (Mishnah 4). @d1Were absorbed there.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because it should say “upon the ashes.” Rather, it must be that it comes to teach that the ashes were absorbed there, and only the place was there [and no ashes].<QC>
@p1[1]@p2<TIE>A meal-offering without specifying.@p3 Otherwise, it should say: “When a person brings a meal-offering to Adonoy, @ITif@it his offering shall be of fine flour,” and afterwards (v. 4): “And when you bring a meal-offering that has been baked in an oven,” as it does concerning the burntoffering (1:3): “If his offering is a burnt offering [of cattle],” [and afterwards (v. 10): “If his offering is from flocks of sheep,”] and then (v. 14): “[If his burnt-offering to Adonoy is] of fowl.” Rather, it must be that the reason it says in a definitive fashion is to convey that whoever says: I am obligated [to bring] a meal-offering without specifying [which one] must bring a fine-flour meal offering. @d1Which is the first.@p3 Rashi does not mean to say because it is the first [mentioned], for if so, one who volunteers to bring a burnt offering [without specifying] should have to bring specifically from cattle. Rather, this is what it means: He brings the fine flour meal-offering which is the first of the meal-offerings, and not from one of the other four meal-offerings that are from fine flour as well. Rashi gives the reason why the fine flour meal-offering is called the first, more than other meal-offerings, and says because its fistful is taken while it is [still] fine flour, but all the other four meal-offerings have their fistfuls taken only after they are baked. Although the halachah follows the view of the Sages (Menachos 104b) who said he [one who volunteers to bring a meal-offering without specifying] may bring from whichever [mealoffering] he wants, [nevertheless,] since this is closer to the verse’s plain meaning, Rashi’s way is to explain it this way even though it is not in accordance with the halachah. @d1But to exclude.@p3 Meaning: Each [mention of the word] “upon it” in Scripture is to include. Therefore, the Sages derived from the first inclusion “upon it” that he shall put the oil on @ITall@it of the fine flour and mix thoroughly together. From the second “upon it,” which would now be an inclusion after an inclusion — and there is no inclusion after inclusion but to exclude — they derived that he should place the frankincense on part of the flour, and it is not required that he put it on all of the flour, for it does not need to be mixed thoroughly. Rather, he puts it on the fine flour in one place, and at the time of burning the fistful, he gathers the frankincense from there and burns both of them together. @d1From its flour and from its oil.@p3 I.e., since it is written: “He takes from there its fistful from its flour and from its oil,” we hear that the oil was mixed thoroughly with the fine flour, which excludes with regard to frankincense, where it is written: “With all its frankincense.” From this we hear that the frankincense is not taken as a fistful with the fine flour, because it is impossible to take all the frankincense with one fistful. Rather, after he takes the fistful [he gathers the frankincense]. @d1Are valid when done by a non-@BIkohein.@bi@p3 Meaning: Rashi knows that “pouring” [is valid when done by a non-@ITkohein@it] because it is written: “He shall pour oil upon it .<TIE>.<TIE>. he shall bring it to the sons of Aharon.” Perforce, before he brings it to the @ITkohein@it, he is permitted to put oil upon it, thus it implies that even a non-@ITkohein@it may “pour.” “Mixing” also [can be done by a non-@ITkohein@it] as demonstrated from what is written (v. 5) regarding a panbaked meal-offering: “mixed with oil,” and afterwards it is written (v. 6): “and pour oil on it.” Perforce, since the pouring is after the mixing, and since the pouring is valid with a non-@ITkohein@it, as we explained, so certainly the mixing, which precedes the pouring, is valid if done by a non-@ITkohein@it (@ITRe”m@it). Rashi mentioned pouring and mixing but did not mention the placing of the frankincense and the bringing, which were mentioned explicitly in the verse, because he mentions a matter through which the meal-offering is done, which excludes placing [the frankincense] because the meal-offering is not done with it, for he gathers the frankincense from it afterwards, and similarly, the meal-offering is not done through the bringing [either] (@ITGur Aryeh@it). @p1[2]@p2<TIE>Spilling out.@p3 @hh<HEB>מבצבץ@ee<ENG> is the translation of @hh<HEB>מבורץ@ee<ENG>; Rashi is explaining what is meant by @hh<HEB>מבורץ@ee<ENG>. @d1Three fingers.@p3 Meaning: with his two other fingers, which are the thumb and little finger, he would make it even, for he would wipe away from below with his little finger and with the thumb from above, so that it would not be overflowing. @d1And this is the meaning of a “fistful.@p3” For in other languages a fistful is called what is inside of four fingers. But since the finger close to the little finger is called @hh<HEB>קמיצה@ee<ENG> in Hebrew, that which is inside the three fingers including the @hh<HEB>קמיצה@ee<ENG> finger is therefore called @hh<HEB>קומץ@ee<ENG> (fistful) (@ITGur Aryeh@it). @d1Must be burned.@p3 Because you might think that the burning is only for the fistful, but the frankincense, which is not included in the taking of the fistful, is not included in the burning [either], therefore, it comes to inform us [otherwise]. @d1A particle of frankincense.@p3 Meaning: Since a fistful that is lacking [in its minimum measurement] is invalid, perforce, if a grain of salt or a particle of frankincense came into his hand, in which case the fistful is lacking, it is invalid. [You might ask:] Why does Rashi reverse the order [of the verse]? He should explain first “his fistful” before he explains “Its frankincense and he shall burn.” [The answer is:] Because you might think that only fine flour and oil are burned, since they are [included] in [the taking of] the fistful, but its frankincense, which is not in the fistful, would not be burned. But now that he explains that although its frankincense is not in the fistful, nonetheless it @ITis@it burned, if so, the words “his fistful” are extra, and it teaches that if a grain of salt or a particle of frankincense came into his hand, etc. (@ITGur Aryeh@it). We need not ask: How does Rashi know that the frankincense is burned? The answer is: Since it juxtaposes “and he shall burn” to “its frankincense,” perforce, even its frankincense is burned (@ITGur Aryeh@it). In the first chapter of Menachos (11a) Rashi raises a difficulty: Let it say [only] frankincense [may not be in the fistful] and I would know salt through a kal vachomer! The answer is: This is taught in the form of “not only this but even that”: If it taught [only] salt [is invalid], I might think specifically salt, for which the Torah does not clearly specify a place for salt is not put into the meal-offering, as it is added only at the top of the altar [invalidates the fistful], but regarding frankincense, which needs to be brought with the meal-offering from the beginning as well, I might think that if a grain of frankincense came into his hand it would be valid, therefore, it lets us know [that it is not] (@ITGur Aryeh@it). @p1[3]@p2<TIE>Takes a portion first.@p3 Otherwise, why does it say, “Aharon and his sons”? Is he worse than his sons? Rather, it must mean that he takes a portion first, without a distribution. @d1After the [fire-]offerings.@p3 I.e., Aharon and his sons may have a portion of what remains of the meal-offering for eating only after the fistful was burned for the sake of Hashem and it becomes a fire-offering of Hashem.<QC>
@p1[4]@p2<TIE>Baked in an oven.@p3 [Rashi states this] for if he did not say clearly, but only said without specifying: “I am obligated to bring a meal-offering,” he brings a fine-flour offering, as stated above. @d1Or matzoh wafers.@p3 As it is written, “And when you bring an offering,” which implies a singular offering. Therefore, when it is written: “Matzohloaves .<TIE>.<TIE>. @ITand@it matzoh wafers,” the @hh<HEB>ו@ee<ENG> of @hh<HEB>ורקיקי@ee<ENG> is like @hh<HEB>או@ee<ENG> (or). @d1Our Rabbis disagree on their smearing.@p3 I.e., [the loaves] are specifically @ITmixed@it [with oil] and [the wafers] are specifically @ITsmeared@it [with oil]. As a result, there is no place to ask what difference exists between them to the point that our Rabbis disagree on their smearing! However, from what is written in the verse: “matzoh-loaves .<TIE>.<TIE>. mixed .<TIE>.<TIE>. or matzoh wafers smeared<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” there is no proof, because I might think that mixed and smeared is the same thing, but only that the term ‘mixed’ is appropriate for loaves and ‘smeared’ is appropriate for wafers. Therefore, Rashi explains [the loaves mixed and the wafers smeared]<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. The difference between mixing and smearing is that mixing is when they are still fine flour and the smearing is after the baking. @d1To permit oil of the second [or third pressing].@p3 [You might ask:] Above, in Parshas Tetzaveh, it says (Shemos 27:20): “crushed for lighting,” and Rashi there explains: [oil from the second crushing is unfit for the menorah] but not for meal-offerings; for there even second oil is fit. If so, why do we need [the drashah here from] “in oil .<TIE>.<TIE>. in oil”? The answer is: I might think that the verse that makes second oil valid is applicable only to meal-offerings [brought together with an animal sacrifice with the] wine-offerings, but for meal-offerings [brought] by themselves, mixed with oil or smeared with oil, [then oil from the second crushing] would be invalid. Therefore, we need the verse, “in oil .<TIE>.<TIE>. in oil.” (@ITRe”m@it). It seems that it comes to permit here even oil of the third [crushing], for I might think [since] for the lighting it requires clear oil, which is the first [crushing], then regarding meal-offerings it drops down only one level, i.e., even the second oil is valid. Thus, it lets me know that even third oil is valid here (@ITDivrei Dovid@it). @d1Ten loaves.@p3 As it is written in Parshas Tzav, regarding the breads of a thanksgiving offering (7:12): “loaves and matzoh wafers,” and it is written afterwards (v. 14): “From it, he shall bring one from each offering as separated portion (@hh<HEB>תרומה@ee<ENG>) to Adonoy.” And we learn [through a gezeirah shavah based on the words] @hh<HEB>תרומה תרומה@ee<ENG>: It is written here (ibid.): @hh<HEB>תרומה@ee<ENG> (separated portion), and it is written (Bamidbar 18:26) regarding the separation of a tenth from the Levites’ tithes (@hh<HEB>תרומת מעשר@ee<ENG>): “[You shall set aside from it] a separated portion (@hh<HEB>תרומה@ee<ENG>) [for Hashem, a tithe of the tithe].” Just as regarding the separated portion from the tithes (@hh<HEB>תרומת מעשר@ee<ENG>) it is written that it must be one out of ten, so too the separated portion [of the thanksgiving offering] here must be one out of ten. [Now,] if the loaves were less than ten or more than ten, a tenth of each offering would constitute a fraction of a loaf. The Torah requires, however, “one” of each type, i.e., it must be a whole loaf or whole wafer, not a fraction (Menachos 77b). @p1[5]@p2<TIE>The fire burnt.@p3 I.e., it is not deep, but rather the pan’s bottom ‘floats up’ (@hh<HEB>צפין@ee<ENG>) close to the rim and the oil scattered towards the pan’s rim. An alternative interpretation: The middle of the pan’s floor, which is the place he would place the meal-offering, was raised from below to above, and protruded like our glass vessels. It was raised like a mount in its middle, and when they put the meal-offering on that place it seemed as if it floated (@hh<HEB>צפה@ee<ENG>), since it was a raised area. @d1Pouring, mixing.@p3 As it is written with regard to the pan-baked meal-offering (v. 5-6): “Mixed with oil .<TIE>.<TIE>. and pour oil on it.” @d1And placing of oil in the vessel.@p3 As it is written with regard to the deep-pan meal-offering (v. 7): “With fine flour and oil you shall make it,” which refers to placing the oil in the vessel. This is before they are prepared, as it is written, “with fine flour and oil,” followed afterwards by, “you shall make it.” Next, we learn [a gezeirah shavah from the words @hh<HEB>קרבנך קרבנך@ee<ENG>]: “@hh<HEB>קרבנך@ee<ENG> (your offering)” stated above [regarding the pan-baked meal offering] from @hh<HEB>קרבנך@ee<ENG> stated below regarding the deep-pan meal-offering, and we apply what is stated by this to that, and what is stated by that to this. Therefore, all of them require pouring, mixing and placing of oil in the vessel before they are prepared. “Before they are prepared” means: Before anything is done with them at all. Although it says: “Mixed with oil<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. Break it into pieces” and only afterwards: “And pour oil on it,” and if so, perforce, after they were prepared he poured the oil on it! Rather, the explanation is [the oil is poured] before they are brought, [i.e., the flour is put into the vessel]. @p1[6]@p2<TIE>To include.@p3 Meaning: It is not the phrase “break it into pieces” that includes all the meal-offerings, for here, the phrase is not extra that it should include, as it is needed for itself. Rather, we derive it from the verse’s end, where it is written, “It is a meal-offering,” because “it is a meal-offering” is extra, to include all the meal-offerings in [the law of] breaking into pieces. [You might ask:] It is written “it,” which implies an exclusion! [The answer is:] “It” excludes the Two Loaves and the Show Bread from [the law that requires the] breaking into pieces. @d1Perhaps.@p3 That which they exclude a @ITmeal-offering baked in an oven@it from pouring, and [they exclude] the @ITTwo Loaves and the Show Bread@it from [the law] of breaking into pieces, is explained in @hh<HEB>פרק אלו מנחות@ee<ENG> (Menachos 75b), because pouring has two exclusions: “on it” and “it,” which excludes the [meal-offering] baked in an oven that has two types: loaves and wafers. Breaking into pieces, however, which has only one exclusion: “it,” excludes the Two Loaves and the Show Bread which need only one exclusion. @p1[8]@p2<TIE>In any of [these] types.@p3 I.e., a meal-offering only needs to be presented to the altar if it is one of the types mentioned, which are the meal-offering of fine flour, baked in an oven, a pan, or a deep pan<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. @d1The owners.@p3 Not that the one who brings the offering should present it, as might be understood, for if so, why does it say “he shall being it to the @ITkohein@it”? What does the @ITkohein@it have to do with bringing it?<QC>
@d1To the southwest corner.@p3 As it is written in Parshas Tzav (6:7): “He shall bring it .<TIE>.<TIE>. before Adonoy, to the front of the altar.” We derive from what is written “before [Hashem]” that it means that the presenting needs to be towards the west side of the altar, which is opposite the Sanctuary entrance; this is [considered] before Hashem. Additionally, when it is written, “to the front of the altar,” it implies the southern side of the altar, where the ramp is located, because the entrance to the house is the front of the house. How can this be reconciled? Perforce, he presents it to the southwest corner of the altar. @p1[9]@p2<TIE>The fistful.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because it is written above: “The @ITkohein@it shall separate from the meal-offering,” and afterwards it is written: “its memorial portion and burn it on the altar<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1[11]@p2<TIE>Sweet [juice] of a fruit.@p3 [Rashi knows this] from what it says next that they bring first fruit offerings from [honey of the first fruits of] dates and figs. If “all honey you shall not burn” refers to bee honey, what does it mean when it says afterwards “You @ITshall@it bring them as a first fruit offering,” i.e., including honey? But, first fruits are not brought from bee honey! Rather, it must be that any sweet juice of a fruit is called honey. However, this raises a difficulty: Perhaps “@ITall@it honey” comes to include date honey @ITand@it bee honey! And [the verse] “You shall bring them as a first [fruit-]offering” refers to date honey alone and to sourdough, because when the Torah says honey without specifying it refers to dates. [The answer is:] Rashi derives this because Scripture should have said “all sourdough or honey,” which would imply that the word “all” refers to both. Since it is written “@ITand@it all honey,” however, it includes another principle: Any sweet juice of a fruit is included (Rav Yaakov Trivash). @p1[13]@p2<TIE>And the water-offering.@p3 I.e., water is brought to the altar by the means of salt because salt has its origins in water. Rashi mentions the example “water-offering” so that you will not pose the difficulty: If it was because of the promise made to the waters, it would be more appropriate that the waters themselves should go up on the altar and not salt. He answers, therefore, that the waters also go up on the altar with the water-offering. You might ask: If so, why are there two things — salt and the water-offering? It would be sufficient with the water-offering, which is preferable! The answer is: Salt and water are two opposite entities — water is liquid and salt is dry. Therefore, one does not make up for the other. You should comprehend these matters well: Why were these two chosen for the altar? Actually, this Midrash contains a concealed matter, which is that everything seeks to be elevated, [as it is said:] We raise up in matters of holiness and do not bring down. [At the time of Creation some of] the upper waters were separated from the upper waters and made into the lower waters, which is the reverse of the order of creation. Therefore, the waters would not agree to be separated until Hashem promised them they would be offered on the altar. In this way, they would acquire a high level by being elevated in an elevation of holiness. Furthermore, we find that Hashem chose only humble species for the altar, as the Sages said: Why did He choose the turtledoves and young pigeons? Because there is no species among the birds that is more pursued than these, and there is no species among the animals and beasts that is more pursued than the ox, sheep, and goat; and Hashem chose them. Also, in a number of places we find: This teaches you that Hashem uplifts anyone who humbles himself. Since the waters were separated to become the lower waters [and thereby humbled], they were promised that they would go up on the altar (@ITGur Aryeh@it).<FJ> [Rashi mentions the water-offering on Sukkos] because he wishes to answer the question: Why was salt water privileged to be brought, more than fresh water? Therefore, he answers that without doubt the fresh water was privileged to be brought on Sukkos, [but even salt water was privileged as well]. The reason why salt water was brought with every offering but fresh water was brought only on Sukkos is because fresh water is representative of the righteous and salt water is representative of the evil-doers. We find that every fast and tefillah needs that evildoers be a part of the congregation. And the proof is from the @hh<HEB>חלבנה@ee<ENG> [galbanum, “spice with a bad odor, to teach us not to look with contempt at the sinners among Israel but to include them in our gatherings for fasts and prayers,” Rashi, Shemos 30:33], which is one of the eleven spices in the @ITketores@it. Therefore, the Torah honors the evil-doers so that they should repent, for the repentant sinner is greater than a completely righteous person (@ITDivrei Dovid@it). @p1[14]@p2<TIE>As meaning “when.”@p3 Then, I may explain it as being an obligation. @d1When there will be a jubilee year.@p3 [You might ask:] Above, at the end of Parshas Yisro (Shemos 20:22), Rashi cites only three [examples], and he does not bring this one. The answer is: Over there he explains according to the view of Rabbi Yishmael, but here he explains according to the view of Rabbi Shimon, who explains this phrase, “@ITwhen@it there will be a jubilee year” as being obligatory. @d1Comes fresh.@p3 I.e., Rashi provides two signs [that it deals with the omer]. One is that it comes fresh, i.e., at the time when the crops ripen, which is the start of the harvest. Secondly, it comes from barley, as is derived from a gezeirah shavah from the words @hh<HEB>אביב אביב@ee<ENG>. @d1Kernels.@p3 I.e., the word @hh<HEB>כרמל@ee<ENG> is a compound word: @hh<HEB>כר מלא@ee<ENG> (full husk).<QC>
@p1[3]@p2<TIE>The fat on the stomach.@p3 Meaning: The fat on the small intestines are included [as well] by kal vachomer, since they have two signs of forbidden [fats]: They are spread like a garment and they have a detachable membrane. Rabbi Akiva, though, says only the [fat on the] small intestines [are included] because they have two signs: They are spread like a garment and they have a detachable membrane, but [the fats] on the stomach are not spread like a garment, but rather are many pieces of fat [that are attached to the stomach]. The word @hh<HEB>תותב@ee<ENG> means a garment, as the Targum Onkeles [writes in Shemos 22:26] @hh<HEB>היא שמלתו@ee<ENG> = @hh<HEB>היא תותביה@ee<ENG>.<QC>
@p1[4]@p2<TIE>Separating.@p3 The separation (the diaphragm) which divides between the respiratory organs and the intestines is called in the Talmud “the lobe of the liver.” @d1The liver.@p3 Accordingly, the word @hh<HEB>על@ee<ENG> means “@ITwith@it a little of the liver.” We should not say [he removes] the entire liver, for if so, it should say “he shall remove @ITthem@it.” @d1And in another place.@p3 I.e. this is proof that “on the liver” means [he should take a little] of the liver [with it]. @d1Aside.@p3 Re”m raises a difficulty: Above, Rashi explains “@hh<HEB>על@ee<ENG>” means “with” and here he explains that “@hh<HEB>על@ee<ENG>” means “aside.” The answer is: The word @hh<HEB>על@ee<ENG> has two explanations, “with” and “aside.” Concerning the kidneys Rashi perforce explains that @hh<HEB>על@ee<ENG> means “aside from the kidneys,” because the entire kidneys are burnt on the altar. However, here when he explains that “@hh<HEB>על הכבד@ee<ENG>” means “aside from the liver,” he is @ITnot@it saying that the word @hh<HEB>על@ee<ENG> appearing in conjunction with “liver” means “aside from.” Rather, he is eliminating an error that we might say the @ITkohein@it burns on the altar only that area of the lobe of the liver which is attached to a small part of the liver, [but not the entire lobe]. Therefore, he explains “aside from the liver,” i.e., the entire lobe was burnt with that little that was attached to the liver (@ITMinchas Yehudah@it). It appears that Rashi’s intention is clear and proper [unlike Re”m contends]. At first, Rashi writes that the fact that Scripture equates the liver and the kidneys was certainly not with regard to burning on the altar, because the liver is not burnt. If so, you might think that not even a little of the liver is burnt on the altar — but this cannot be. This is because we find different expressions regarding the liver: Here it says: “on the liver,” and in another place it says (9:10): “from the liver.” Thus, it must be that it teaches that the liver is burnt as well, and perforce this means a part of it. Then, Rashi is answering the question: Since it is written: “On the liver on the kidneys,” this implies that they are completely equal, but you maintain that only a part of the liver is burnt whereas the entire kidneys are burnt? To answer this Rashi writes: “[That is,] aside from the liver and aside from the kidneys — he should remove this.” Meaning: With regard to removing [the lobe] they are both equal — the lobe needs to be removed from the liver and the kidneys, each one according to its law — this one in part and this one entirely. Therefore, Rashi concludes “he should remove this,” i.e., in this aspect the liver is the same as the kidneys [but not for burning on the altar] (@ITDivrei Dovid@it). @p1[5]@p2<TIE>Every sacrifice.@p3 Rashi does not derive that [the daily burnt-offering] must precede [every sacrifice] from “@hh<HEB>על העולה@ee<ENG>,” because there is no implication from the word @hh<HEB>על@ee<ENG>, which means “aside from,” whether it precedes or comes after. Rather, [he derives this] from what is written later: “That is on the logs which are on the fire,” which implies they already arranged the burnt offering on the logs which are on the fire. @p1[7]@p2<TIE>Into two sections.@p3 Meaning: Not in one section like the voluntary burnt-offering, where it is written (1:10): “If his offering is from flocks of sheep — of lambs or of goats — etc.” @p1[8]@p2<TIE>Only the sin-offering.@p3 Concerning the sin-offering brought inside [the Heichal] it is written (4:6): “The @ITkohein@it shall dip his finger into the blood and he shall sprinkle from the blood” and concerning the sin-offering brought outside it is written (ibid. 34): “The @ITkohein@it shall take some blood from the sin-offering with his finger and put it atop the corners of the altar.” [Concerning the rest of the offering, however, it says that the @ITkohanim@it should sprinkle the blood and does not mention “finger”] (@ITR’em@it). [You might ask:] Why does Rashi not mention this above regarding the peace-offering of cattle? The answer is because it is not so much of a proof above, for perhaps the @ITkohein@it did sprinkle the blood with his finger, and although Scripture does not write “finger,” we should learn a place where it is not specified from where it is clearly written — regarding the sin-offering. Therefore, Rashi waited until the end of all the sacrifices and since none of them mentioned “finger” except the sin-offering, perforce [only for the sin-offering was the blood sprinkled with the finger] (@ITGur Aryeh@it). @p1[11]@p2<TIE>Food of the fire.@p3 Meaning: The form of a noun with two @ITsegolim@it under the @hh<HEB>פ@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>ע@ee<ENG> position of the @hh<HEB>פֶעֶל@ee<ENG> [such as @hh<HEB>לֶחֶם@ee<ENG>] is the same whether it is annexed to the next word or stands alone, and it is unlike the other annexed words that change to the @hh<HEB>חטף@ee<ENG> vowel [when annexed to the next word]. @d1For the sake of the Most High.@p3 I.e., the meaning of @hh<HEB>לה'@ee<ENG> is “for the sake of Hashem,” but not that one gives to Him, for it already is written (Tehillim 50:12-13): “If I were hungry I would not tell you<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. [Will I eat the flesh of bulls or do I drink the blood of he-goats?]”<QC>
@p1[17]@p2<TIE>The entire verse is well explained in Toras Kohanim.@p3 They learned from this that the prohibition of fats is even in the everlasting house [the Beis HaMikdash], during the time it is standing and also when it is destroyed, in the Land of Israel and outside the Land. Thus it is explained in the first Perek of Kiddushin (37b).<QC>
@p1[2]@p2<TIE>A negative commandment and kareis.@p3 This excludes circumcision and Pesach, which only have kareis [but are positive commandments; also, not for something whose intentional violation is a negative commandment alone, such as not harvesting the corners of the field, and most of the Torah’s other negative commandments]; and not something which is a negative commandment and punishable by execution by a Beis Din, but not kareis, such as one who strikes his father or mother, one who kidnaps an Israelite, or the rebellious elder; and not for something whose intentional violation is a negative commandment and has the penalty of kareis, but it does not involve an active deed, such as one who curses his father, conspiring witnesses, a blasphemer, a sorcerer, an enticer or one who causes others to worship idols, or a false prophet. All these were learned from what it is written [regarding idol worship] (Bamidbar 15:29): “One law shall apply to anyone who sins inadvertently,” and it is written (ibid. 30): “But if a person should act highhandedly (intentionally) .<TIE>.<TIE>. [and that soul shall be cut off from among its people].” The Torah compares (@IThekeish@it) all the inadvertent transgressions of the Torah and the inadvertent transgression of idolatry in that they are liable for its intentional violation the penalty of kareis and for its unintentional violation, a sin-offering. @d1Noach of Nochor.@p3 Because it is written, “@ITfrom@it one [of these],” it implies that even a part [of one of them]. We should not say [that one who writes on Shabbos] even one letter, because we derive from the word “one” as well, i.e., as if Scripture wrote, “one,” which would imply [he writes on Shabbos] the entire name. Therefore, [in resolution] we say that he is liable only if he writes Shem of Shimon, which is both, a whole name in itself, and also part of another name. @p1[3]@p2<TIE>With an unintentional act.@p3 I.e., first, the law was concealed from him and he ruled against the halachah, and then he personally acted according to his decision. However, if the @ITkohein@it ruled for others and they acted according to his decision, the @ITkohein@it is exempt [from bringing the sin-offering], because it is written, “[He shall bring] for @IThis@it sin which @IThe@it committed.” @d1Perhaps an old one? The verse says: “son.”@p3 Meaning: If Scripture had only written “a bullock,” I would think that even a four or five year old [was acceptable], therefore, it lets me know “son” — because everywhere it says “son” [it refers to] a two year old, as it is written (9:2): “Take, for yourself, a young calf (@hh<HEB>בן בקר@ee<ENG>), for a sin-offering and a ram, for a burnt-offering, unblemished ones.” So too, regarding years, just as the ram is two years old, the young calf is also two years old. If it said “son” [perhaps a young one?] Meaning: Now that it is written “bullock” and also “son of cattle,” perforce, it must be explained as a bullock close to [the age of] a “son,” which is three years old. You might ask: Rashi explains above (1:10): “And if .<TIE>.<TIE>. from flocks of sheep” — “excluding [an animal too] old”? [Why is another exclusion needed here?] The answer is: I might think that Scripture excludes with regard to a burnt-offering, but with regard to a sin-offering, I might think even an old animal is valid. [Therefore,] the verse says: “son,” and not an old one (@ITRe”m@it). This raises a difficulty: Rashi explains above regarding the burnt-offering (ibid.): “[From flocks,] of lambs, of goats” — “these [are three] limitations — excluding [an animal that is ill], one [that is] too old [to be offered], and one [that is] filthy.” Why is another exclusion needed here for offering an old one? Perhaps you will say: There, it is with regard to a burnt-offering and here it deals with a sin-offering, therefore it needs an independent [source of] exclusion. If so, however, it remains difficult: Scripture should have written here another exclusion for the one that is ill and one that is filthy. The answer is: With regard to being invalid because of illness or filth, which is repulsive, we can easily derive [the law of] a sin-offering from a burnt-offering, as it is logical to invalidate such an animal because of [the reason mentioned in Malachi 1:8]: “[When you offer a blind animal for a sacrifice, is there nothing wrong? And when you offer a lame or a sick one, is there nothing wrong?] Were you to offer it to your governor, [would he accept you or would he favor you]?” However, regarding the old one which is [merely] older than three years, it is not logical [that it should be invalid]. Rather, it is a Scriptural decree that it is invalid. [Thus,] I might think [it is invalid] only where the Torah reveals so. [Therefore,] Scripture lets me know that an [old] sin-offering is invalid as well (@ITDivrei Dovid@it).<QC>
@p1[5]@p2<TIE>To the Heichal.@p3 This does not refer specifically to the Mishkon, but rather the same applies to the Beis HaMikdosh, as it is written in Parshas Chukas (Bamidbar 19:13): “He has defiled the Mishkon of Adonoy,” and afterwards it is written (v. 20): “For he has defiled the Mikdosh of Adonoy.” Our Sages derived from this (Shavuos 16b): If it says Mishkon, why does it say Mikdosh? And if it says Mikdosh, why does it say Mishkon? Rather, it applies the laws of this to that, and of that to this. Perforce, there is no difference between them, but only that Scripture uses the term Mishkon because it was in existence at that time. [You might ask:] Why did Rashi not explain this above (1:3) with regard to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting? [The answer is:] Because there it refers to the courtyard, and the term “courtyard” applies equally to the Mishkon and the eternal house [Mikdosh]. However, the term “Tent of Meeting” is applicable only to the Mishkon, and the holiness of the Mishkon was exchanged for the holiness of the eternal house, for this one’s holiness was temporary and this one’s holiness is eternal, [thus, it was necessary to explain that although this is so, the mitzvah of ‘bringing’ applies to them both]. @p1[6]@p2<TIE>In front of the space between the poles.@p3 Otherwise, why does it say “the Holy [Curtain]”? Rather, [it comes to teach us that] the sprinkling is valid only on the spot exactly in front of the space between the poles of the Aron HaKodesh, and not any other place along the Curtain’s width. @d1Not touch.@p3 [Rashi knows this] since it is not written, “@ITon@it the Holy Curtain,” implying even without touching.<QC>
@p1[7]@p2<TIE>The remaining blood.@p3 Although he already sprinkled from it, it is called “@ITall@it the blood.” This teaches that the one who slaughters needs to receive all the bullock’s blood, as if it says: All the bullock’s blood he shall receive, and afterwards sprinkle. After the sprinkling, he pours the remaining [blood]. @p1[8]@p2<TIE>The bullock of Yom Kippur.@p3 Re”m writes: They taught the same in regard to “He shall spill all the bullock’s blood” — It should have stated [“its blood,”] etc. Rather, [it comes] to include the bullock of Yom Kippur for spilling [the blood]. Rashi, however, only brings what they derived from the verse: “And all the fat of the bullock,” but I do not know why. It appears that it is because it is a disagreement between Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Yishmael, as cited in the Yalkut on this Parshah (pg. 157, see there). (@ITMinchas Yehudah@it). Rashi did not bring this because in Zevachim (25a) they derived another matter from this verse — that the one who slaughters needs to receive all the blood of the bullock (@ITGur Aryeh@it). @d1The goats of idolatry for the kidneys.@p3 This is [Rashi’s] text in Toras Kohanim, but our version is: “To include the goats of idolatry for all that was stated in this matter.” [You might ask: They said the @ITgoats@it of idolatry] although there is only @ITone@it goat [brought as the sin-offering] for idolatry! It is brought together with the bullock burnt-offering, as it says in Parshas Shelach (Bamidbar 14:24), for an anointed @ITkohein@it who inadvertently violated idolatry brings a goat like an ordinary person. The answer is because all the tribes, each one separately, would bring a bullock for their burntoffering and a goat for a sin-offering for the [transgression of] idolatry violated due to the inadvertently incorrect ruling of the Beis Din. If so, there were twelve goats, as we find in Horiyos (4b and 5a) (@ITRe”m@it). @d1From that which is still attached.@p3 And the meaning of “from it” is when the bullock is still whole. @p1[10]@p2<TIE>But what was explained.@p3 Meaning: Just as it specifies all the fats with regard to the peace-offering, it also specifies them here regarding the bullock of the anointed @ITkohein@it. @d1Just as peace-offerings [must be offered] for their own sake.@p3 As it is written (3:1): “If his offering is a peace-offering<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Perforce, the Merciful One [in the Torah] is particular that the offering must be offered for the sake of a peace-offering. @d1Law from a law.@p3 Meaning: Since the bullock of the matter concealed from the community (v. 13) was needed to teach about the goats [brought as a sin-offering] for idolatry with regard to the lobe of the liver and the two kidneys, in that they are compared through a @IThekeish@it to one another regarding the burning of the inner parts, as it says in Zevachim (41a). However, Scripture does not write the lobe of the liver and the kidneys in the section of the bullock of the matter concealed from the community [itself]. Instead, [they are derived] through a @IThekeish@it from the bullock of the anointed @ITkohein@it, where it is written (v. 20): “He shall do to the bullock [the same] as he did to the sin-offering bullock.” And [the Rabbis] taught [in a Baraisa]: “To the bullock” — this is the bullock of the matter concealed from the community; “To the sin-offering bullock” — this is the bullock of the anointed @ITkohein@it: Just as the bullock of the anointed @ITkohein@it has the two kidneys and the lobe included its inner parts [that are burnt on the altar], so too the bullock of the matter concealed from the community. And [since] we may not derive a law from a law [which itself was derived from Scripture], Scripture was therefore required to write the verse: “In the same manner as they were separated” regarding the bullock of the @ITkohein@it, even though it is not needed for itself, to say: If it is not needed for itself, it should be applied to another matter — the bullock of the matter concealed from the community [and it will be considered as if it was written explicitly in the section of the bullock of the matter concealed from the community]. We learn from this that if it were not written clearly [by the bullock of the matter concealed from the community], the [law of the] goats [brought as a sin-offering] for idolatry could not be derived from the bullock of the matter concealed from the community, since a matter that was itself derived through a @IThekeish@it cannot go back and teach [about something else] through a @IThekeish.@it @p1[12]@p2<TIE>Beyond the three.@p3 [Rashi knows this] from what is written here: “Encampment,” and later on in this section it is written (v. 20): “[The same] as he did to the sin-offering bullock, so he shall do to it,” and then it is written (v. 21): “He shall take the bullock outside, beyond the encampment.” Why is this needed? Obviously, it is extra, in order to derive from it one more encampment. [That it should be beyond] the third encampment is derived from what it is written in Parshas Tzav (6:4): “He shall take out the ashes beyond the encampment.” It should only say: “He should take out the ashes,” and I would know that it is beyond the encampment, because it is written in our section: “Beyond the encampment, to a pure [undefiled] place, where the ashes are thrown,” [thus,] this [the place where the ashes are thrown] is outside the encampment. Obviously, it is [also] extra, to derive from it another encampment. Thus, [we derive that he takes it out] beyond @ITthree@it encampments. The three encampments are: The encampment of the Divine Presence, from the entrance to the courtyard and within. From the entrance to the courtyard to the entrance to the Temple Mount is the Levites’ encampment, and from the entrance to the Temple Mount until the city gate is the third encampment. Beyond the city gate is outside of three encampments. @d1Outside the city.@p3 This raises a strong difficulty: There is no difference between the eternal house and Shilo, and the other places, for in every place where the Ark was located there were three encampments. The Gemara says [the same] clearly in Sanhedrin 42b, see there. The answer is: Perhaps it is a textual error and it should say “And in Jerusalem” (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it). [You might ask:] Why does Rashi reserve the verse’s order to explain first “to a pure place” and then, “beyond the encampment” — “beyond the three encampments”? [The answer is:] This is to say: How do we know that the explanation of “beyond the encampment” is “beyond the three encampments”? Therefore, Rashi explains [first] “to a pure place” — Since there is a place prepared for impurity outside in which they throw out stones stricken with plague, and that is certainly outside of three camps. This is because the stricken house was inside the city, and it was necessary to take it outside. If so, when it is written: “beyond [the encampments],” it means beyond the three encampments, which is outside the city (@ITGur Aryeh@it). @d1A place.@p3 I.e., this does not refer to the ashes that were lifted from inner consumed parts, which are the ashes from “when the fire consumes the burnt-offering on the altar” (6:3) each day [i.e., the trumas hadeshen], for those ashes were not thrown out beyond the encampment. Rather, he would rake a full pan of ashes each day and place it in the courtyard on the ramp’s eastern side, as it is written (6:3): “And he shall separate the ashes<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @d1There are no ashes there.@p3 You might ask: How does Rashi know? Perhaps the verse’s repetition is to [make it] an absolute requirement, that if there are no ashes there, it is invalid? (@ITRe”m@it). The answer is: It should only say: “It shall be burnt upon the ashes.” Why [does it say:] “It shall be burned @ITwhere @itthe ashes@IT are thrown@it”? Rather, it must be [that it teaches he burns the bullock] upon the place of the ashes although there are no ashes there at all. @p1[13]@p2<TIE>The Sanhedrin.@p3 [Rashi knows this through a gezeirah shavah:] because it says here “@hh<HEB>עדה@ee<ENG> (congregation)” and it says later “@hh<HEB>עדה@ee<ENG>” (Bamidbar 35:24-5): “Then the congregation shall judge<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. The congregation shall protect”: Just as @hh<HEB>עדה@ee<ENG> that is mentioned later refers to the Beis Din, so too @hh<HEB>עדה@ee<ENG> that is mentioned here refers to the Beis Din. And since it says: “Congregation of Yisroel,” perforce [it is referring to] the special congregation of the people of Yisroel, which is the Great Sanhedrin that sits in the Chamber of Hewed Stone. @d1That the community acted according to their decision.@p3 The word @hh<HEB>הקהל@ee<ENG> (the community) is linked to the previous phrase and to the next phrase. [It is linked to the previous phrase, as follows]: “And the matter was concealed from the eyes of the community” — which is the Great Sanhedrin; they decided against the Halachah and said to the nation: “You are permitted.” [And it is linked to the next phrase:] “The community and they did” — that the community acted according to their decision. In such a case the Great Sanhedrin bring a young bullock<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. @p1[18]@p2<TIE>Opposite the entrance.@p3 Otherwise, why does it say “at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.” You might ask: Why did Rashi not explain this above (v. 7) regarding the bullock of the anointed @ITkohein@it? The answer is: Rashi explains here that this refers to the western base [to let us know that spilling the blood there impedes. We should not say that he spills the blood there only] because he first passes that side when he exits the Tent of Meeting after completing the sprinklings inside, for the reason that we do not pass over mitzvos. Therefore, the second verse comes to teach us that this is the requirement of the mitzvah, and it is not because of the rule that we do not pass over mitzvos. Rashi in Zevachim (51a) answers in a different way as to why “at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting” is repeated a second time, and we can resolve it differently based on his answer. @p1[20]@p2<TIE>This.@p3 Rashi adds the word “this” to the word “bullock” because if the first [sacrifice] was a goat or sheep, it would be correct to say, “He shall do to the bullock as he did to the goat or sheep.” It is not correct, however, to say, “He shall do to the bullock as he did to the bullock.” Because of this, Rashi added the word “this.” Also, it is not correct to say, “He shall do to @ITthis@it bullock as he did to the sin-offering bullock,” unless the word “first” is added [i.e., “as he did to the @ITfirst@it sin-offering bullock]. For this reason, Rashi needs to say: “As explained in regard to the bullock of the anointed @ITkohein@it, etc.” [which takes the place of the word “first.”] [Also,] so that we should not err and say perhaps it refers to another bullock, such as the bullock of Yom Kippur, although it has not yet been mentioned, Rashi therefore adds [“As explained in regard to the @ITbullock of the anointed kohein@it, etc.” in place of] the word “first.” @d1The lobe and two kidneys.@p3 Rashi mentioned: “To include the kidneys and the lobe,” and did not mention the fats, because all of them are included in the statement: “He shall burn all its fat,” and this is according to [Rabbi Yossi]. I have already explained this above (v. 10) with regard to what Rashi explains: “And [it is taught] Shechitas Kodoshim, etc. that we may not derive a law from a law [which itself was derived from Scripture].” What Rashi writes: “And to repeat, etc.” is according to the Tanna Kamma in Toras Kohanim and not according to Rabbi Yishmael (@ITRe”m@it). @d1To teach that if he omitted.@p3 This is its explanation: We also learn from it, i.e., from: “He shall do to the bullock<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” that he should sprinkle the blood as he sprinkles the blood regarding the sin-offering bullock. You might object: It says clearly that he sprinkles the blood! Therefore, Rashi explains that it repeats twice [to teach] that if he omitted [one of all the applications<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.] (@ITMinchas Yehudah@it). @d1With one application he has atonement.@p3 It atones even with only one application, i.e., with one sprinkling he achieves atonement, and it does not impede atonement [although most sin-offerings require two applications that are four in direction]. On the inner altar, however, [if he lacks one of the required sprinklings] it does not achieve atonement for him. @p1[22]@p2<TIE>An expression of “fortunate is<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”@p3 Meaning: This is because the verse [began with @hh<HEB>אשר@ee<ENG> and] did not begin with the usual “If (@hh<HEB>אם@ee<ENG>) a leader sins,” as it is written, “If the anointed @ITkohein@it<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” and “If the entire congregation<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” This is the statement of Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakai in the Gemara (Horiyos 10b). [It is written] in the Zohar (Vayikro pg. 38-9): “Rabbi Yitzchok taught<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. ‘If a leader sins’ — because he was haughty<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. Rabbi Yehudah taught<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” It appears that he does not disagree with Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakai. Rather, it is only that the verse does not depart from its plain meaning, as Ibn Ezra explains: “If a leader sins. Reverse it: [@hh<HEB>אשר יחטא הנשיא@ee<ENG>]. It is connected to what it states above: “If the entire congregation,” as if it says: “If the one that sins is the leader.” If so, according to the words of Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakai alone it should say: “@hh<HEB>ואם אשר נשיא יחטא@ee<ENG>” because @hh<HEB>אשר@ee<ENG> is extra, rather, it is an expression of “fortunate.” From the fact it is not written @hh<HEB>אם@ee<ENG>, it includes here that it comes to hint that he will surely sin, in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yitzchak and Rabbi Yehudah. But according to their words alone, it is difficult: Everything is in the hands of Heaven except for the fear of G-d. You might ask: Why according to the Ibn Ezra is it not written @hh<HEB>אשר יחטא נשיא@ee<ENG>; why did it reverse the order? The answer is: As it says in Horiyos (10b), it comes to teach that this [offering] should not be brought for previous sins, for if he sinned and then was appointed leader, he brings like [the offering of] an ordinary person, as it is written: “@hh<HEB>אשר נשיא יחטא@ee<ENG>,” that he sinned when he was [already] the leader (Rav Yaakov Trivash). @p1[24]@p2<TIE>In the north.@p3 You might ask: It already says in Parshas Tzav (6:18): “In the place where the burnt-offering is slaughtered, the sin-offering shall be slaughtered”! The answer is: This establishes an obligation — that it should be slaughtered only in the north, and if it is not slaughtered in the north, the offering is invalid. @d1Not for its sake, it is invalid.@p3 Meaning: We derive this since it is written “@hh<HEB>הוא@ee<ENG> (it is),” because @hh<HEB>הוא@ee<ENG> implies that it is as it should be, i.e., one should bring in the first place for the sake of a sin-offering. If it is not as it should be, however, because it was slaughtered for the sake of a burnt-offering, it is entirely invalid. @p1[25]@p2<TIE>The remnants of its blood.@p3 But not all of its blood, because he already put some of it on the corners of the altar. @p1[26]@p2<TIE>A goat.@p3 Rashi said “as those parts (@hh<HEB>אימורים@ee<ENG>)” instead of “as that fat” which would be understood [more directly] from the word [in the verse] “as the fat,” because Scripture does not intend to specify the fats. This is because the phrase, “all its fats” [already] includes all the fats. Rather, the verse’s intention is to add the lobe and the kidneys, which are not included in the statement, “all its fats.” Rashi [then] says: “which are detailed regarding a goat which is discussed [in the section dealing with] the peace-offering” because the peace-offering of a sheep also includes the tail fat among the @hh<HEB>אימורים@ee<ENG>, but the sin-offering of the leader is a goat, which has no tail fat.<QC>
@p1[35]@p2<TIE>On the fires which are made for, Hashem.@p3 Meaning: [This does] not [mean he shall burn the fats] on the fire that descends from Heaven, which in actuality is a “fire of Hashem,” for that fire was @ITone@it, and in the verse it is written: “The @ITfires@it of Hashem,” [i.e.,] those which are made for Hashem [by human effort]. @p1[1]@p2<TIE>In which he is a witness.@p3 This is derived from “He is a witness,” which is redundant [since the verse had already stated “he heard an oath” and continues with “or saw or knew”]; it excludes a witness who heard [secondhand] from another witness, a relative, or an invalid [witness] — even though he hears an oath [demanding testimony] he is exempt. Also, it teaches: “And he is a witness” — now, at the time of the oath, he is a witness in the matter, [but if they made him take an oath that if he will become aware of testimony in the future that he must testify, he is exempt]. @p1[2]@p2<TIE>And after this impurity he eats.@p3 You should not err and say that only because of touching something impure which was concealed from him and was later became known to him does he bring an offering. Therefore, Rashi says: “After this impurity he eats holy [sacrificial food or enters the Temple]. His proof is since it is written, “And incurs guilt,” i.e., by eating holy [sacrificial] food or entering the Temple, which must be after touching this impurity, for otherwise, why would he incur guilt? [Could we say that] because he becomes impure he should bring an offering? We should not ask: How does Rashi know that he eats holy [sacrificial food] or enters the Temple? Perhaps he is obligated to bring the offering for another transgression! The answer is: Rashi’s proof is since it is written here (v. 3): “Whatever that impurity may be,” and in Parshas Chukas it is written (Bamidbar 19:13): “And his impurity remains upon him.” [We derive through a gezeirah shavah:] Just as there it deals with the impurity of the Temple, so too, here, it deals with the impurity of the Temple, i.e., that he enters the Temple. Furthermore, it is written here: “The impurities of man,” and it is written in Parshas Tzav (7:21): “The impurities of man,” just as there [it deals with] eating holy [sacrificial food], so too, here, [it deals with] eating holy. @d1The impurity.@p3 Meaning: [The impurity was concealed from him] and not [the fact he entered] the Temple or [the awareness of] its holiness, since it is written: “And this was concealed from him and he is impure” — [from which we derive:] He is liable for concealment of impurity and not for concealment of the Temple. @p1[3]@p2<TIE>One who swallows the carcass.@p3 This causes a person to become impure in the place of swallowing [i.e., when the carcass that is swallowed touches the esophagus] to make garments [that he is wearing] impure; if he eats it and enters the Temple he is liable. You might ask: The word @hh<HEB>בה@ee<ENG> [“@hh<HEB>אשר יטמא @HBבה@ee<ENG> (that causes impurity @ITwithin@it)”] is an exclusion! They already answered in the Gemara (Shavuos 7b) that it is because there is an extra exclusion — for it is written [here] in the section of the sliding scale offering (i.e., a sacrifice whose worth varies in accordance with the financial ability of the person bringing it): “Or, if he @ITtouches@it the impurities of man.” Thus, something [which imparts impurity] through touching is included, but what is not [capable of making impure] through touching is not. The carcass of a kosher bird does not impart impurity through touching, if so, why does the Merciful One [in the Torah] write “within”? Hence, it is an “exclusion after an exclusion,” and “an exclusion after an exclusion” only comes to be inclusive. @d1And he does not know, for he forgot.@p3 It seems that the text [“and he does not know,” which seems to be Rashi’s words] is a scribal error, and it should say: “And he realizes” [i.e., as a @ITdivrei hamaschil@it (s.v.)] — “that he forgot the impurity.” It is, in effect, a separate comment, meaning: “And he realizes” — this is to say that he now realizes that he forgot about the impurity when he ate the holy food or entered the Temple. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it). Nachalas Yaakov corrected the text based on the difficulty he had in Rashi’s text: “And he does not know, for he forgot.” [The reason he changed Rashi’s text is that] this does not follow any view — for Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva disagree about the reason the Torah repeats twice the word @hh<HEB>ונעלם@ee<ENG> (and it was concealed): Rabbi Akiva holds the view that we require that the person [who ate in impurity unintentionally] knew it was prohibited before the transgression and afterwards, and Rabbi Yishmael holds that the first word @hh<HEB>ונעלם@ee<ENG> obligates for not knowing he was impure and the second word @hh<HEB>ונעלם@ee<ENG> is for not knowing he entered the Temple or that he ate holy food. But Rabbi Akiva establishes it for previous knowledge and not for being unaware he was impure. Therefore, Nachalas Yaakov corrected the text [to follow the view of Rabbi Akiva]: “It should say: And he knew.” However, Gur Aryeh explains: He is only liable if he @ITforgot@it the impurity but beforehand knew about the impurity. But if he had no knowledge whatsoever of the impurity, he is not liable. This is derived from the second time the word @hh<HEB>ונעלם@ee<ENG> is written: “@hh<HEB>ונעלם והוא ידע@ee<ENG> (and this was concealed from him, and he realizes).” This did not need to be written, for it is already written (v. 2): “And this was concealed from him, and he is impure.” Rather, you should place the phrase, “And he realizes” between one @hh<HEB>ונעלם@ee<ENG> and the other, and derive from it: After he had knowledge, he forgot the impurity. Therefore, Rashi writes as a comment to “@hh<HEB>ונעלם@ee<ENG>” — “And he did not know,” which is to say: [He is liable] specifically in this type of not knowing — that he @ITforgot@it about the impurity [of which he once knew]. However, if he never knew about the impurity in the first place he is not liable. @d1Entering.@p3 [This is derived] from the gezeirah shavah mentioned above (see v. 2). However, this raises a difficulty. It is understandable over, for it is written: “And this [impurity] was concealed from him, and he incurs guilt,” i.e., because the impurity was concealed from him he entered the Temple. Here, though, it is written: “[And this was concealed from him,] and he @ITrealizes@it, he incurs guilt.” Could it be that because he knew he was impure he ate holy food or entered the Temple?! Perhaps the answer is: The verse is written out of order, and this is what is meant: “This was concealed from him and he incurs guilt” — because the impurity was concealed from him he entered the Temple and afterwards it was known to him that he was impure (@ITRe”m@it). Furthermore, we can say: We derive a gezeirah shavah from the words @hh<HEB>ואשם ואשם@ee<ENG>, and we derive the later section from the previous section. @p1[4]@p2<TIE>But not with his heart.@p3 I.e., if he decided in his heart by making an oath silently without verbalizing not to eat, and then he ate, he is not liable to bring an offering. @d1To himself.@p3 This excludes if he took an oath to harm others, for instance, [he said:] “I will hit Ploni,” but he forgot and did not hit him, he is not liable to bring an offering. Rashi’s proof is from what it is written: “To do harm or to do good” — we make a @IThekeish@it (comparison) between the two — just as to do good is optional, so too to do harm is optional, excluding harming others, which is not optional, as it is written (Devarim 25:3): “He shall flog him with forty [lashes]; he shall not exceed.” With regard [to an oath] to do good, however, he is liable [for failing to keep an oath] even towards others. [You might ask: If so,] why does Rashi write: “Do good” — for himself? [The answer is:] Since he said that doing harm is for himself, he said that doing good is also for himself, but in fact he is liable [even for failing to keep an oath] to do good for others, as it is explained in the third chapter of Shavuos (26b). @d1And he violated.@p3 Scripture is truncated; it should have written: “This was concealed from him and he violated.” Otherwise, for what would he bring an offering? Would he bring an offering because it was concealed from him? [You might ask:] Why does Rashi not explain here upon the word, “@hh<HEB>ואשם@ee<ENG> (and he incurs guilt)” as he does above, with regard to the word @hh<HEB>ואשם@ee<ENG> in the verse dealing with impurity (v. 2, 3)? The answer is: The word @hh<HEB>ואשם@ee<ENG> written here is followed by the phrase, “for any one of these,” which implies that it refers to all the aforementioned sins. Therefore, perforce we must say that the verse, “And it was concealed from him” is a truncated verse, and it is as if it says: “It was concealed from him and he violated his oath, when he realizes [his sin],” i.e., when he finds out afterwards. It then returns: “And he incurs guilt for any one of these<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. He shall bring his guilt-offering” (@ITRe”m@it). @d1A sliding scale sacrifice.@p3 Meaning: If he is wealthy he brings a female lamb or she-goat; if he is poor he brings two turtledoves or two young pigeons; and if he is of the poorest of the poor he brings a tenth of an eiphah. Therefore, this offering is called the sliding scale sacrifice. @d1As is explained.@p3 Although Rashi does not need to say all this, for Scripture is clear about it, as it explicitly stated in this section, nevertheless, he says it so that he can say: “But [violation] of an oath<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” as it says in the end of the parshah (v. 21): “If a person sins and wrongfully deviates<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1[8]@p2<TIE>One organ.@p3 In the first chapter of Chulin (21b) Rashi explains because it is written: “He does not separate,” and a bird is slaughtered with only one siman (gullet @ITor@it windpipe). If he does anything more than what is necessary it is considered “separation.” A further consideration: the [severing of the] entire organ is included in the mitzvah of slaughtering a bird in the preferred way — therefore, regarding shearing [the head], when he nips the entire siman it is not “separation.” With regard to the second siman, however, there is not even a mitzvah [of slaughtering] in the preferred way, as [the Rabbis] taught [in a Baraisa] (ibid. 27b): To obligate him in two simanim is impossible, for a bird was already compared to fish. @p1[9]@p2<TIE>For its sake.@p3 This was explained above (Rashi 4:24) regarding the sin-offering of a leader. Rashi repeats it [here] because it is dealing with bird sinoffering and above it is dealing with an animal sin-offering, and [one cannot learn from the other because] they have dissimilar aspects. Therefore, he repeated the explanation here. @p1[10]@p2<TIE>According to the rule.@p3 Meaning: Its head is sheared in both simanim (gullet and windpipe) and according to all the instructions outlined in the [free-will fowl burnt-offering]. Rashi interprets: “@hh<HEB>כמשפט@ee<ENG>” [literally, as the judgment,] as “according to the rule” because [the term] judgment or justice does not pertain to an offering. @p1[12]@p2<TIE>Not for its sake.@p3 Meaning: For example: He brought it at first for the sake of a pan-baked meal-offering and then at the time of taking a fistful he took it for the sake of a deep-pan meal offering, or vice versa. Rashi repeats this here [see v. 9] because this is a meal-offering and those above refer to an animal or bird, and [one cannot be learnt from the other because] they have dissimilar aspects. @p1[13]@p2<TIE>Of these three.@p3 One is a lamb or goat, the second is turtledoves or two young pigeons, and the third is a tenth of an eiphah of fine flour. @d1And the less severe.@p3 Meaning: The most severe of them are [entering] the Temple or [eating] the holy [foods] in impurity (5:2), which is punished by koreis. And a less severe case is the one who took an oath to testify (5:1), which is not punishable by koreis if intentionally violated, but Scripture equates the intentional violator to the unintentional one. This is because with regard to all of them it is written, “and this was concealed from him,” but here [concerning the one who took an oath to testify] it does not say, “and it was concealed from him.” [This comes] to make him liable [to bring an offering] for the intentional violator as the unintentional one. The least severe is the oath expressed orally, which is not punished for intentional violation with koreis, and the intentional violator was not equated to the unintentional one. [You might ask:] It is written (v. 7): “If his means are not sufficient [for a sheep<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” which implies that the poor person brings turtledoves or pigeons for the same sin the rich person brings a lamb. If so, why would you assume: “Perhaps the most severe of them (=sins)<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”? We can answer:] This refers to the wrongdoing, as if to say: If he did not touch upon a wrongdoing that would be sufficient when violated to be liable to bring a lamb, rather, only a lesser transgression — he should bring two turtledoves. And if he did not touch upon a wrongdoing that requires two turtledoves, but only a lesser wrongdoing, he should bring a tenth of an eiphah. Therefore, it writes: “In one of these” to equate the least to the most severe [sin]. @d1Its remnants should be eaten.@p3 Accordingly, the meaning of “as a meal-offering” is: As the free-will meal-offering mentioned above, for all the remnants of all the free-will offerings are eaten by the @ITkohanim@it. @d1Completely burnt.@p3 [According to this:] “To the @ITkohein@it” is interpreted in conjunction with the preceding phrase and with the next phrase. I.e., [@ITWith the preceding phrase@it: “And it shall belong to the @ITkohein@it” means:] If the meal-offering is from an [Israelite] sinner, [the remaining portion] shall belong to the @ITkohein@it. [@ITWith the next phrase@it:] “To the @ITkohein@it [as a meal-offering” means:] As the @ITkohein@it’s free will offering, and any free-will meal-offering [of a @ITkohein@it] — the remnants are eaten by the @ITkohanim@it. @p1[15]@p2<TIE>[Means] changing.@p3 I.e., He “changes” it from sacred property to not sacred, even though he did not drive benefit from it, for instance: If a Temple treasurer gave money of sacred property to another person who went and took it out of the domain of sacred property, the Temple treasurer has misappropriated the sacred funds, as the Mishnah states in Maseches Meilah. The correct text is: “@hh<HEB>אין מעילה אלא שנוי@ee<ENG> (@hh<HEB>מעילה@ee<ENG> always means ‘changing’),” and we should not use the text: “@hh<HEB>בכל מקום@ee<ENG> (wherever it occurs).” It means: @ITThis@it @hh<HEB>מעילה@ee<ENG> can only mean “changing,” etc. (@ITRe”m@it). [This is because] Re”m raises the difficulty: The word @hh<HEB>מעילה@ee<ENG> written concerning the guilt-offering of thievery does not connote “changing,” because someone who withholds payment of a hired worker or denies owing a debt is not taking anything out of the owner’s domain, and yet it says there (v. 21): “@hh<HEB>ומעלה מעל@ee<ENG> (and wrongfully deviates).” This is no difficulty, however, for he certainly does take it out of the owner’s domain. This is because we have established the Halachah that the Sabbatical year will not release [the debt of] one who denies a loan and stands by his denial. But if there was no change of ownership, and it remained as it originally was [before his denial], the Sabbatical year should release him [from his debt]. Thus, this is [also] called “changing.” (@ITGur Aryeh@it). Divrei Dovid answers that it is also called a change of domain there, because the obligation [to bring a guilt-offering] is only if he swears falsely. If so, he turns away from Hashem in that he takes His Name in vain, and throws off His yoke. In this it resembles idolatry which is mentioned afterwards. @d1And where.@p3 Meaning: We derive through a gezeirah shavah [from the words] @hh<HEB>חטא חטא@ee<ENG> from terumah. It says here: “@hh<HEB>וחטאה בשגגה@ee<ENG> (and unwittingly sins)” and it says regarding terumah (22:9): “@hh<HEB>ולא ישאו עליו חטא וגו'@ee<ENG> (lest they bear sin<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.).” Just as @hh<HEB>חטא@ee<ENG> mentioned with regard to terumah is [referring to the case] where he benefited from it, as it is written (ibid. 14): “If a man inadvertently @ITeats@it of sacred-offering,” where he benefits by eating, so too @hh<HEB>חטא@ee<ENG> mentioned here is where he benefits from the sacred property — even if he did not change it from the sacred domain to an ordinary domain and did not harm it — for instance, he drank from a gold cup or wore a sacred ring on his finger. Thus, the meaning of @hh<HEB>וחטאה@ee<ENG> is “@ITor@it he unwittingly sins,” i.e. [“If a person wrongfully deviates”] — he changes it from one domain to another but does not have benefit, [“or he unwittingly sins”] — or he has benefit from it but does not change it, he has misappropriated “and shall bring his guilt-offering<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @d1Against eating.@p3 Meaning: [Perhaps] the same applies as with the other benefits that are included in “consuming,” where the Merciful One [in His Torah] was not concerned that it be harmed, so too here the Merciful One warned only against eating and the like, but not that it must be harmed, [for example,] if he wore a sacred garment and had a copper coin’s worth of benefit from it, even though he did not harm it in the value of a copper coin, he has misappropriated? The verse says: @hh<HEB>תמעול מעל@ee<ENG> — it [thus] includes [even actions aside from eating]. I.e., if it is a thing which usually gets damaged, he has not misappropriated if he has benefit from it until he damages it. This is as [the Rabbis] taught [in a Mishnah] (Meilah 18a): One who derives benefit from sacred property, even though he has not damaged it the worth of a copper coin, he has misappropriated; these are the words of Rabbi Akiva. But the Sages say: One does not misappropriate with something which is susceptible to damage until he damages it, but with something that is not susceptible to damage he misappropriates as soon as he derives benefit from it. How is this so? If he placed a gold necklace [of sacred property] on her neck or a ring on her finger, or drank from a golden cup, he has misappropriated. @d1@hh@HB<HEB>תמעול מעל@BO<ENG> — it [thus] includes [even actions aside from eating].@p3 [Rashi does] not [mean] exactly that it includes, because we do not actually derive this through an “inclusion.” Rather, [it is derived] from a comparison (@IThekeish@it) to idolatry, in which it is written @hh<HEB>מעילה@ee<ENG> (Divrei Hayomim I, 5:25): “They deviated from the God of their fathers”: Just as regarding idolatry there is a change, for until now, before he bowed down to it, it was in his domain and benefit was permitted, but now its domain has changed and it has entered the domain of the idolatry, and deriving any benefit from it is prohibited; this is its damage. This is what is meant by: “It includes” — Scripture includes it through this @IThekeish@it. Here as well, if it is a matter that is usually damaged, even if he has benefit from it he has not misappropriated until it is damaged (@ITRe”m@it). @d1Excluding sacrifices of lesser holiness.@p3 Meaning: Misappropriation is not applicable to the meat of sacrifices of lesser holiness both before the blood is sprinkled or after the blood is sprinkled, because they are not designated for the sake of Hashem alone; their only restriction is that they may be eaten only inside the walls [of Jerusalem], but they are permitted to an ordinary Jew who may eat them. The meat of sin-offerings and guiltofferings as well: misappropriation is applicable to them before the blood is sprinkled, but after sprinkling there is no misappropriation since they are permitted to be eaten by the @ITkohanim@it. @d1Implying toughness.@p3 See above in Parshas Vayeitzei on the verse (Bereishis 31:38): “[And I did not eat any] rams of your flocks<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @d1Worth two @BIselaim@bo. Rashi informs us that @hh<HEB>בערכך@ee<ENG> means “they are worth,” and not an actual estimation, for the translation of estimation and appraisal is not applicable here. Rather: “they are worth.” @p1[16]@p2<TIE>The principal and the fifth.@p3 Rashi informs us that the meaning of, “@hh<HEB>את אשר חטא@ee<ENG> (that which he sinned)” is the principal, as if it says: “The principal upon which he sinned he shall pay,” and not “the @ITsin@it that he sinned,” as the apparent meaning of Scripture, for the concept of payment does not pertain to sin, and certainly that [it is not something that] he would give to the @ITkohein@it (@ITRe”m@it). We find in regard to terumah that he pays the principal to the owners and the fifth to any @ITkohein@it he wishes, therefore, Rashi needed to explain that he gives the principal and the fifth to the @ITkohein@it (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it).<QC>
@p1[18]@p2<TIE>In the value recorded.@p3 It is the value of two silver selaim (shekalim) of holy selaim. You might ask: Say that the guilt-offering of the nazir and the guilt-offering of the metzoro is two selaim, and the guilt-offering [brought by one who seduced] an engaged maidservant is even one sela. The Sages answered this question in Toras Kohanim: I include the guilt-offering of an engaged maidservant which is a [two-year old] ram, the same as the uncertain guilt-offering, and I exclude the guilt-offering of the nazir and metzoro which is a [one-year old] lamb and not a ram. @p1[19]@p2<TIE>A guilt-offering @BItwo-years old@bi.@p3 This is surely a scribal error, because why would Scripture need to write that the guilt-offering of the engaged maidservant should be two-years old, since it is written “ram” concerning the engaged maidservant (19:21), the same as here? What is the strength of “ram” written here over the word “ram” written concerning the engaged maidservant? Furthermore, Rashi says: Perhaps I should include the guilt offering for a nazir and the guilt offering of a metzoro? But why would you think that the guilt-offering of the nazir and metzoro should be a two-year old ram, when it is written “lamb” concerning them, and whenever it is written “lamb” or “calf” it refers to a one-year old? Rather, we have to correct the text: “that it should [consist] of a ram @ITworth two Shekalim@it.” This is because it is not written regarding the engaged maidservant, “the valuation of two shekalim,” and so it lets us know here that we require two shekalim here as well (@ITGur Aryeh@it). @p1[21]@p2<TIE>Acted faithlessly with Hashem.@p3 Toras Kohanim. This is the explanation: In the section regarding misappropriations it is written (v. 15): “If a person wrongfully deviates” and does not say, “from Hashem” [as it does here] (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it). @d1With witnesses and a document.@p3 This raises a difficulty: What denial is there here of witnesses and a document, and [how is] taking a false oath [applicable]? For surely, when there are witnesses he does not take any oath, for he must pay. It seems that Rashi is referring to that which it says in Baba Metzia (3a): [Rabbi Chiya] taught [in a Baraisa]: One says to his fellow man: I have one-hundred gold pieces deposited by you, but he responds: I have nothing of yours, and witnesses testify that he has fifty. He must pay fifty and take an oath on the rest, as the law of one who admits to a partial amount [of the claim]. This is because his oral confession should not be greater than the testimony of witnesses, and the same law applies if the claimant later shows a document for fifty (@ITDivrei Dovid@it). @d1The Third between them.@p3 Meaning: Hashem, Who is the Third between them. What it says afterwards: “or a deposit, or theft, or oppressed his friend,” refers only to: “and [he] denies to his friend” but not to: “[he] deviates from Hashem.” @d1That he stole something from him.@p3 Meaning: The phrase, “or theft” does not refer back to “and he denies to his friend,” that you should say “@hh<HEB>או בגזל@ee<ENG>” is the same as “@hh<HEB>פקדון@ee<ENG>,” which means: he gave his friend a deposit, money which he placed in his possession to invest, and we would [then] say “@hh<HEB>או בגזל@ee<ENG>” is also explained this way — that his friend gave him a stolen object he had stolen and he [the recipient] denied to his friend with regard to that deposit. [This cannot be,] for if so, “@hh<HEB>בגזל@ee<ENG>” would be the same thing as “@hh<HEB>פקדון@ee<ENG>.” @p1[22]@p2<TIE>Any of these.@p3 Rashi added the word “these” to say that the phrase “@hh<HEB>אשר יעשה וגו'@ee<ENG> (whatever [someone] will do<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.)” is not connected to the word “@hh<HEB>מכל@ee<ENG> (of all)” that appears before it. Rather, [@hh<HEB>מכל@ee<ENG> is connected to @hh<HEB>על אחת@ee<ENG> (in any), as if it says] “in any of all these aforementioned instances,” and it is a truncated verse. “Whatever [someone] will do” is an independent matter, for Scripture wishes to inform us that it is not unusual that someone will deny money to his fellow man, even though there is a Halachic presumption that a person is not brazen-faced in front of the one to whom he is indebted. This is because it is a common matter that someone swears falsely for the sake of denying his fellow man’s money. @p1[23]@p2<TIE>To repent.@p3 Otherwise, who is forcing him to return the theft, since there were no witnesses here? Perhaps by himself? If so, what did he think originally when he denied and swore falsely? Rather, it must be: When he recognizes in himself [the need] to repent<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. This is a truncated verse, and it is as if it says: “It shall be that when he admits that he sinned and incurs guilt, he shall return the stolen property<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”<QC>
@p1[24]@p2<TIE>The principal.@p3 Meaning: The principal is called the head because it is the head of the money, since it is the main source and the root of all profit that results from it, just as the head of a living creature which is the main source and root of all its limbs. @d1The money belongs.@p3 To exclude someone who is the relative or friend of [the one to] whom the money belongs. This is the same as: “Everyone’s holy things shall belong to him” (Bamidbar 5:10), upon which the Sages derived that it is his prerogative to give them to whichever @ITkohein@it he wants, because the pleasure of giving to whom he chooses is the right of the owners. See later in Parshas Naso (ibid.).<QC>
@p1[2]@p2<TIE>An expression of “urging.”@p3 Rashi explains in the Gemara (Kiddushin 29a) that [@hh<HEB>זירוז@ee<ENG> means] one should be quick and vigorous. You might ask: Why does Rashi not explain this above on the verse in Parshas Tetzaveh (Shemos 27:20)? The answer is: [There,] the urging is a result of the special expertise needed to harvest the olives from the olive tree’s top [branches] and to crush them in a mortar so there will be no sediment. @BOAnd for generations@bo. [Rashi knows this] from what is written (Devarim 3:28): “Command Yehoshua and strengthen him” — [the addition of the word “and strengthen him” shows that] this is an expression of “urging.” “And for generations” — it is written in Parshas Emor (24:2-3): “Command the children of Israel and let them take [pure olive] oil .<TIE>.<TIE>. from evening until morning before Hashem, continually, as an everlasting statute throughout your generations,” this stipulates “for generations.” “Immediately” — it says in Parshas Behaloscha (Bamidbar 8:3): “Aharon did so; he lit the lamps toward the face of the menorah, as Hashem had commanded<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” — this denotes “immediately.” @BOMonetary loss@bo. I.e., [Rabbi Shimon is saying] it is specifically in a place where there is monetary loss that it needs to write @hh<HEB>צו@ee<ENG> for urging, but where there is no monetary loss it does not need to write @hh<HEB>צו@ee<ENG>, even if it is an expression of urging, immediately and for future generations. And [according to this] Rabbi Shimon disagrees [with the Tanna Kama]. [You might ask:] It says here @hh<HEB>צו@ee<ENG> even though there is [seemingly] no monetary loss! The answer is: Since the kohanim do not have any benefit from the burntoffering besides its skin, and that was only given to the @ITkohein@it who brought the burnt-offering, therefore it is called a monetary loss as well. However, Re’m writes that Rabbi Shimon is not coming to argue on the words of the Tanna Kama. Rather, he is coming to add and say that the primary reason that Scripture uses the expression “command” is because there is monetary loss. However, when there is no monetary loss [although there is urging, immediately and for future generations,] the word @hh<HEB>צו@ee<ENG> is not applicable. The same applies when there is no urging, immediately and for future generations, although there is monetary loss, the expression @hh<HEB>צו@ee<ENG> is not applicable, etc. (see there, where Re’m dwells at length). [You might ask:] It is written regarding the apportioning of Eretz Yisroel (Bamidbar 34:2): “Command (@hh<HEB>צו@ee<ENG>) the children of Yisroel,” although there is no monetary loss! The answer is: Since the entire people of Yisroel were disparate with regard to the conquering of the Land, for one tribe took a larger portion than another, and some took a portion in the hills and some in the plains, it is also considered, in some aspect, a monetary loss. Re’m, however, explains the entire matter differently, examine it and choose for yourself. Meaning: Rashi is answering the question: Why does it say this, specifically here? All the offerings are applicable immediately and for future generations! He answers: All the offerings have a benefit for the kohanim in that they receive a portion of the sacrifice. Therefore, each @ITkohein@it will hurry and not be indolent in the Divine service, so that he will not be preempted by someone else. This however, does not apply to a burnt-offering, which is entirely burnt, and the kohanim did not receive any of the meat. Therefore, I might think they would be indolent with it. This then would be a monetary loss for the @ITkohein@it of that watch. Therefore, it says @hh<HEB>צו@ee<ENG>, an expression of urging (@ITDivrei Dovid@it). Nachalas Yaakov explains that regarding other offerings they bring only the blood and the fats [to the altar] and the meat is eaten by the kohanim. Thus, their benefit is large and their effort is minimal. This is not so concerning the burnt-offering, for a lot of effort is involved [in bringing it to the altar] and its benefit is minimal — [they receive] only the hide — therefore, it requires urging. Rashi is answering the question: The laws of the burnt-offering were already set down in Parshas Vayikro! Rather, it comes to teach<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. (@ITGur Areyeh@it). @BOValid all night@bo. Rashi knows this from the end of the verse, where it is written: “All night, until the morning.” It is [from there] he derives this.<QF> @d1If taken up, need not be taken down@bo. This is because the altar sanctifies them. It is written afterwards: “@ITIt@it is the burnt-offering” — which comes to exclude, implying “it” and not another. [This implies that some of them, even if they were taken up must be taken down. When is this so?] Rashi explains [later]: “@ITIt@it is the burnt-offering, to exclude [a male animal] which was with a woman and [a female animal] which was with a man, and similar cases, whose disqualification [did not occur] in the Holiness [=the Temple].” Rashi is saying that these could have been disqualified before they were sanctified, [and therefore, even if they went up on the altar must be taken down,] but other invalid sacrifices, for instance, those that became impure, or other disqualifications that are inapplicable until after they had become sanctified, [if they were taken up they need not be taken down]. Toras Kohanim lists all these [examples], and Re’m cites them. Re’m writes: You might ask: Why do we need this exclusion: “@ITIt@it is the burnt-offering” — to exclude [a male animal] which was with a woman and [a female animal] which was with a man that if they went up on the altar they must be taken down? They were already excluded by Scripture in the verse (1:2): “From an animal” in Parshas Vayikro. Since they were excluded there, [to teach] that they are not sanctified, why do we need the exclusion here — that if they went up on the altar they must be taken down? It is obvious that since they are not sanctified, they are not sacred, and certainly they must be taken down from the altar. The Sages already answered this in the Gemara (Nidah 41a), that [two verses are needed, one for a non-sacred animal that he tries to sanctify — that it will not be sanctified, and] one verse for a sanctified animal, that although he sanctified it originally, if it went up on the altar it must come down, [since it was invalidated in a way that could have happened before it became sanctified]. @p1[3]@p2<TIE>Linen garment@bo. Rashi is answering the question: Why is it written: “The @ITkohein@it shall dress in his linen garment (@hh<HEB>מדו בד@ee<ENG>),” [using the unusual expression @hh<HEB>מדו@ee<ENG> for garment instead of @hh<HEB>בגד@ee<ENG>]? Above (Shemos 28, 39-40), it does not use such an expression concerning the garments of Aharon. Rashi answers: This is the @ITkutones@it (undershirt) mentioned with regard to the garments of the kohanim that is worn close to his skin. The phrase, “On his skin” refers to both, for if it referred only to the linen pants, it should write: “The @ITkohein@it shall dress in his linen garment, and linen pants on his [body] skin.” Why does it say, “he shall wear”? Rather, [it must be that] it refers to @hh<HEB>מדו@ee<ENG> as well, which is the @ITkutones@it (@ITRe’m@it). @BOAccording to his size@bo. Meaning: It should not be longer or shorter than his body, because I might think that since it is on his skin and he is wearing other garments on top of it, if it was shorter than his body it is of no concern. Therefore, Scripture teaches us [that it must be according to his size]. Otherwise, why does Scripture not call it a @ITkutones@it as in the other places? @BOConsumed ashes.@bo Since it is written, “He shall separate the ashes,” which is an expression of separation — that he separates from the ashes. If he were to rake up all of it there would not be any separation. @BOThe innermost.@bo. Because it is reasonable [to assume] that what was lying in the middle of the fire was extremely burnt up, they would take the innermost ashes. @BOOn the east of it. @boThis is because it is written “next to the altar,” and the ramp was next to the altar. How do we know that it was the eastern side of the ramp? This is proven from what it is written in Parshas Vayikro (1:16): “Beside the altar, eastward, [to the place of the ashes].” There, too, it implies next to the ramp, and it is clearly written “eastward.” Perforce the place of the ashes was at the eastern side of the ramp, and that is what is meant by “eastward.” @BOAnd makes them ashes@bo. Rashi is rectifying with this [the problem we might have] because the plain meaning of the verse implies that the @ITashes@it consume the @ITfire@it. Therefore, he explains: “And makes them ashes,” i.e., the word “fire” refers to the phrase “[which consumes] the burnt offering.” Furthermore, Rashi explains that he separates @ITfrom@it that ash, so that you will not think [he takes] @ITall@it the ashes which [the fire] makes of the burnt-offering. Re’m explains: Otherwise, [it is problematic that] the verse begins with the ashes and concludes with the consumption of the burnt-offering. It should be understood as if it says, “And he shall separate the ashes” — and which ashes are these? — those “that are as a result of the fire that consumes [the burnt-offering” and makes it ashes]. @p1[4]@p2<TIE>Clothes in which he cooked. @boIf Scripture had written: “He shall [then] remove his garments and dress in others,” I would understand that it is an obligation: If he wore [until] now priestly garments, he should now wear non-sacred garments, or vice versa. However, now that it is written, “He shall [then] remove his garments and dress in other @ITgarments@it,” this implies garments like the first ones, i.e., if the first ones were non-sacred, he should now wear non-sacred ones as well. If so, what is the difference between the first ones and the second ones? Therefore, Rashi explains that the other garments are of lesser worth than these, but both are sacred garments. If so, why does he need to remove them? Perforce [it is because of] good manners: “This is not [obligatory,] but good manners.” @BOWhich are gathered. @boRashi is answering the question: Above, it is written, “and he shall separate,” and here it is written, “he shall take out”! Furthermore, here it is written: “beyond the encampment,” and there it is written, “next to the altar.” Upon this Rashi explains: “[He shall take out the ashes] which are gathered in the heap.” This, then, is the difference between [the mitzvah of] “and he shall separate” and [the mitzvah of] “he shall take out” — [the terumoh was obligatory every day and the removal was only when there was a great deal of ash. Also, the terumoh was from the innermost ashes and the removal was from the ashes gathered in the heap] (@ITRe’m@it). @p1[5]@p2<TIE>Our Rabbis differed on the number@bo. The largest number of all [these views was that] each day there were four woodpiles: One was the large woodpile upon which they arranged the burntofferings [and all the sacrifices burnt that day]. Afterwards he placed two wooden logs upon that large woodpile; this was the woodpile for the sake of maintaining the fire, because if the [fire of the] large woodpile did not prevail over [the sacrifices], then this additional woodpile of two wooden logs would maintain the fire and prevail. Afterwards, he arranged another woodpile on the altar to burn the limbs that had not been consumed [whether because they had not been placed on the large woodpile or because they had not yet been consumed — thus, three woodpiles were placed one after another in the surrounding area of the large woodpile]. Before the placement of the two wooden logs they would arrange a second woodpile for the incense alongside the large woodpile, on the southwest corner, at a distance of four amos north of the corner. It was called “[the woodpile] of incense” because the @ITkohein@it would rake the coals from there to bring to the inner altar in the morning and evening for the purpose of burning the incense upon these coals. @BOIf [a peace offering] is brought@bo. Rashi is answering the question: It is understandable [for Scripture to mention] a burnt-offering [since] every day there was a continual burntoffering, but perhaps there was no peace offering! Therefore he explains: @ITIf@it a peaceoffering is brought there, they should burn it after the morning’s continual offering. @BOLearned from here@bo. Our Sages were answering the question: If so, it should say @hh<HEB>חלבי שלמים@ee<ENG>, why does it say @hh<HEB>השלמים@ee<ENG> with the @hh<HEB>ה@ee<ENG>? Therefore, they removed it from its plain meaning and explained it as referring to the matter of “completing” [all the sacrifices]. @p1[6]@p2<TIE>That too is kindled from the outer altar@bo. You might ask: Above, Rashi explains: “[The Torah] here includes many kindlings and all of them are expounded in Maseches Yoma,” and he brings the verse “a continual fire” there as well! [Why, then, is it available for a drashah here?] The answer is: This is what Rashi means above: [The Torah] here includes many kindlings, but why are they needed? It is understandable [that the Torah mentions] “a continual fire” — I need to expound from it “a fire of which it is said, ‘continual,’ [etc.]” However, why do I need the rest? With regard to this Rashi explains: “All of them are expounded [in Maseches Yomo].” @BOTwo prohibitions. @boBecause it is written twice, “It shall not go out.” @BO@bo @p1[7]@p2<TIE>To require oil@bo. Meaning: Every time the word @hh<HEB>תורה@ee<ENG> is written in Scripture it comes to include, as Rashi explains above (v. 2). @BOThat is bringing near@bo. And not burning as the plain meaning implies, for the @ITkohein@it would burn only the fistful and not the entire [meal-offering], as it is written: “He shall separate from it, when he takes his fistful .<TIE>.<TIE>. and he shall burn on the altar<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @BOTo the southwest corner@bo. As Rashi himself explains: It is written “before Hashem,” which is the west<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. “To the front of the altar” — that is the south<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.<QC>
@p1[8]@p2<TIE>That he should not take [the fistful] by measure. @boMeaning: He should not make a utensil that holds a fistful and use it to measure. Rashi’s proof is because it is written @hh<HEB>בקמצו@ee<ENG> and it is not written@hh<HEB>מלא קמצו @ee<ENG> (the full fistful) [as in 2:2 above]. @BOIn which the oil is plentiful@bo. Otherwise, why does it say, “and from its oil”? It already is written in Parshas Vayikro (2:1) that all the fine flour is mixed with oil, and since the fistful [was taken] from the fine flour, it surely must have included oil. Accordingly, the @hh<HEB>ו@ee<ENG> of @hh<HEB>ומשמנה@ee<ENG> is a @hh<HEB>ו@ee<ENG> of explanation, meaning as if it says: And from which place does he take the fistful? — @hh<HEB>ומשמנה@ee<ENG> — where the oil is plentiful. @BOAnd burns it. @bo[Rashi knows this] because it is written, “He shall separate from it, when he takes his fistful,” and afterwards it is written: “and all the frankincense.” This implies that the frankincense is not included in the taking of the fistful.<QC>
@p1[9]@p2<TIE>In the courtyard of the Tent of Meeting@bo. You might ask: Why does it say, “In a sacred place”? The answer is: It comes to include the chambers built in a non-sacred place that have an opening into the courtyard of the Tent of Meeting, in which it is permissible to eat meal-offerings, as we find in the first Chapter of Keilim and in Zevachim 56a. @p1[10]@p2<TIE>Even the left-over portions@bo. So much more so that what is burnt on the altar [is prohibited when chometz], as it is clearly written in Parshas Vayikro (2:11). Rashi’s proof [that even the left-over portions are prohibited] is that the word @hh<HEB>חלקם@ee<ENG> (their portion) is juxtaposed to “It should not be baked as leavened.” @BOLike a sin-offering@bo. As it is written (4:24): “@ITIt@it is a sin-offering,” it should remain as it is, [i.e.,] it must be slaughtered for the sake of a sin-offering. However, regarding a guilt offering it says “it is a guilt-offering” only after its fats have been burnt [on the altar], but [the guilt-offering] itself even though its fats have not been burnt is valid (as Rashi explains on 7:5).<QC>
@p1[11]@p2<TIE>To include [kohanim] who have a physical defect@bo. Meaning, they receive a portion of the meal-offering together with the unblemished kohanim, portion for portion. I might have thought they are included only for eating the sacrifices, as it is written (21:22): “The bread of his God which is of the most holy .<TIE>.<TIE>. he may eat,” but they may not take a share together with the unblemished kohanim, since they are not allowed to bring the sacrifices. Thus, it lets us know<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. @BOAnd absorb from it. @boIt is written, “Whatever shall touch,” why then does it say, “@ITthem@it”? Rather, [the extra word @ITthem@it] teaches that it touches and enters into them, [i.e.,] it is absorbed within. @BOIf it is invalid, they become invalid. @boI.e., the place where it touches, but not all of it. @BOUnder the stringent rule [of eating] the meal-offering.@bo That is, it must be eaten within the Temple courtyard, and for but one day and night, until midnight. @p1[13]@p2<TIE>Even ordinary kohanim@bo. [Rashi knows this] because why does the Torah say, “and his sons”? Indeed, kohanim gedolim are mentioned when it says (v. 15): “The @ITkohein@it who is anointed<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @BOWho is anointed in his stead@bo. Meaning: The phrase, “as a mealoffering, always” is connected with “the @ITkohein@it who is anointed” (v. 15), and not with “and his sons” (v. 13). If so, their meal-offering is not continual. It is [brought] only on the day of their inauguration, like the day the @ITkohein gadol@it is anointed, which is the inauguration for the @ITkohein gadol.@it It is written: “@hh<HEB>ביום המשח@ee<ENG> (on the day that he is anointed)” and not @hh<HEB>מיום המשח@ee<ENG> (@ITfrom@it the day he is anointed), in order to include the inauguration of the ordinary kohanim as well. Otherwise, it should say, “from the day,” because from that day onward the @ITkohein gadol@it continually offers [the meal-offering].<QC>
@p1[14]@p2<TIE>In an oven and thereupon fries it. @bo[Rashi knows this] because it is written @hh<HEB>תופני@ee<ENG> which comprises the words @hh<HEB>תפי נא@ee<ENG> (baked raw), implying that it is uncooked. This teaches that it should be uncooked when he bakes it and not fried. Therefore, Rashi explains that it is baked originally and afterwards fried. @BOBreaking@bo. Although [breaking] is explicitly mentioned, Rashi comes to exclude from Rabbi Shimon’s view that the meal-offering of kohanim and the meal-offering of the anointed @ITkohein@it do not require breaking, i.e., he should not fold each piece into two and then into fours, etc. since there is no taking of the fistful from these meal-offerings. It is written here only “@hh<HEB>פתים@ee<ENG> (broken pieces)” but not “@hh<HEB>פתות אותו פתים@ee<ENG> (break it into pieces),” as it does regarding the meal-offering of a Yisroel (2:6). @p1[15]@p2<TIE>The one anointed of his sons in his stead@bo. Rashi explains by changing [the order of] the verse because we could have explained @hh<HEB>המשיח תחתיו@ee<ENG> — the anointing shall be in his stead. Or, we could have explained it as: “the anointed in his stead of his sons, shall bring the offering,” i.e., the son should bring the offering. Therefore, Rashi explains by changing the verse so that “in his stead” will be connected to “of his sons” and not with “the one anointed”; “in his stead” connotes one person in succession to another (@ITMinchas Yehudah@it). See Kitzur Mizrachi, Mahara’n, Gur Areyeh, and Divrei Dovid — each one has a unique approach in this. Meaning: According to the verse’s order it would seem that the anointed one in his stead who is one of his sons shall offer this meal-offering, to exclude an anointed one who is not one of his sons — that he should not offer. This cannot be. But now [that Rashi reverses it] it means the anointed of his sons in his stead shall offer it [always], to exclude any of his sons who is not anointed shall not offer it [always] (@ITKitzur Mizrachi@it). @BOAll of it is completely [burnt]. @boThis is to exclude that you should not explain “@hh<HEB>כליל@ee<ENG> (completely burnt)” refers to all the meal-offerings, and it means that the @ITfistful@it of all the mealofferings should be burnt. [Therefore, Rashi explains that the word @hh<HEB>כליל@ee<ENG> refers only to this mealoffering,] and @hh<HEB>כליל@ee<ENG> means all of it is completely burnt. So too, every meal-offering of a @ITkohein@it, of a voluntary offering. I.e., not that a @ITkohein@it’s meal offering should be different than an anointed @ITkohein@it’s meal offering — that is why Rashi adds: “so too, etc.” — that it is also completely burnt. Rashi adds, “of a voluntary offering,” because without this it would imply: So too the @ITkohein@it’s obligatory meal offering [is completely burnt], just as the anointed @ITkohein@it’s [meal offering that is obligatory], but not a voluntary one. Therefore, it lets us know that both of them are completely burnt. @BOSo too, every meal-offering of a @BIkohein@bo. Rashi’s proof is that it is written: “Every mealoffering of a @ITkohein@it<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1[16]@p2<TIE>Equally, to the Most High. @boI.e., since it says “shall be completely,” but it did not say whether for the sake of the Most High [burnt on the altar] or for an ordinary person [completely eaten], for this reason Rashi explains it is entirely for the Most High, i.e., it is burnt. @p1[19]@p2<TIE>One fit [to perform] the Temple service@bo. Rashi did not explain the verse according to its plain meaning — “[The @ITkohein@it] who offers it as a sin-offering, shall eat it” — because it is written (v. 22): “Every male among the kohanim may eat it.” We need not ask: Perhaps the one fit for the avodah shall eat it — to exclude a @ITkohein@it who has a physical blemish, who is not fit. [The answer is:] It is written: “Every male” — to include a @ITkohein@it with a blemish. Perforce, it comes to exclude an impure @ITkohein@it who immersed in a mikveh that day [and could eat it at night] — @ITthat he has no share@it. We should not say: Say the opposite! The one who immersed in the mikveh that day may eat at night, but the @ITkohein@it with a blemish may never eat. [We do not say this because] it is logical that the @ITkohein@it with a blemish should partake since he is allowed to eat immediately, and to exclude the one who immersed that day who may not eat until the evening. Meaning: It is impossible to say that it means [only the one who offers] should actually eat it, and the one who was impure at the time of the sprinkling [of the blood], who was not fit for the avodah, will be forbidden afterwards from partaking [in the meat of the offering] at all. Because if so, a minor as well, who was not fit for avodah at the time of sprinkling would be forbidden afterwards to eat. And if you would claim that this is so — [it cannot be, for] we include from “Every male” — even a minor — “may eat it.” Rather, here we only exclude that he [i.e., the impure @ITkohein@it] @ITmay not have a share@it in the meat (@ITDivrei Dovid@it). @p1[20]@p2<TIE>Which touches and absorbs@bo. In Toras Kohanim: You might think that even if it did not absorb, therefore, the Torah says: “In its flesh” — until it absorbs, etc. This Baraisa is brought in Zevachim (97a) (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it). @BOBloodspot on the garment. @boThe verse implies that one is required to sprinkle on the entire garment, but this cannot be. Therefore, Rashi explains: “If<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” And the meaning of “@hh<HEB>ואשר@ee<ENG>” is: [If] it will have been sprinkled, as Rashi explains nearby. In Toras Kohanim: You might think that the entire garment requires washing, therefore, the Torah says: “Whatever it is sprinkled upon, you shall wash” — the bloodspot requires washing but the entire garment does not require washing. @BOIn the court@bo. As it is written (v. 9): “In a sacred place, in the courtyard of the Tent of Meeting.” Perforce, the courtyard of the Tent of Meeting is the “sacred place.” @p1[21]@p2<TIE>Becomes @bo@hh<HEB>נותר@ee@BO@bo<ENG>(meat left overnight that is invalid and must be burnt). After the day and the night that follows it. You might ask: Leave it until after daybreak on the morrow when it [the taste absorbed in the vessel’s wall] will give a bad taste (@hh<HEB>נותן טעם לפגם@ee<ENG>) and it will not require breaking or scouring! The answer is: Since at daybreak on the morrow the obligation to break or scour is immediate, it does not lapse afterwards (@ITRe’m@it). With regard to Re’m’s question I stood trembling and astonished. Why is he raising such a difficulty? It is only with respect to [the prohibition of] eating, which depends on the taste of the forbidden food, that it is permitted when it gives a bad taste, since [in this case] he does not benefit. This is not so concerning @hh<HEB>נותר@ee<ENG>, which has to be burnt — the main mitzvah of burning is even after its taste has gone bad and it was left longer than its time period. As long as it is in the world he is required to burn it. How would the fact that the taste has gone bad help in this case? Therefore, the Torah commands to break the earthenware vessels and scour and rinse copper vessels so that they will not come to the circumstance of having a bad taste and of being @hh<HEB>נותר@ee<ENG> at the time of daybreak. This is because it is prohibited to bring something to the condition of becoming @hh<HEB>נותר@ee<ENG> so that it will have to be burnt. How would having a bad taste help to nullify the mitzvah of burning the @hh<HEB>נותר@ee<ENG>? It was not that the Torah said the earthenware vessel needs to be broken because it will discharge [the taste of @hh<HEB>נותר@ee<ENG>] into the food that is cooked in it afterwards, for certainly, even if he wants to leave it and not cook anything in it afterwards it does not help. Rather, he would be transgressing by causing @hh<HEB>נותר@ee<ENG> and he blemishes that which is holy. Therefore, he needs to break the earthenware pot since it is not possible to burn the absorptions of @hh<HEB>נותר@ee<ENG> in it (@ITDivrei Dovid@it). @p1[1]@p2<TIE>But its exchange is not@bo. Meaning: The exchanged animal itself is not sacrificed, nevertheless, it becomes holy and does not go out to become non-sacred. It is left to graze until it develops a blemish. Then, it is sold and its value is used to buy a voluntary offering.<QC>
@p1[3]@p2<TIE>Ram or lamb@bo. Rashi is answering the question: Why is it not written: “If he is bringing a lamb<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” or “If he is bringing a goat<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” [as it does regarding peace-offerings (3:7-12)]?<QC>
@p1[5]@p2<TIE>Whose owners have died@bo. That is, [the owners died] before they brought the guilt-offering, so it no longer needs to be offered since death atones. @BOHave been atoned for@bo. For instance, he separated a guilt-offering and it was lost, and he brought another guilt-offering. Afterwards, the first guilt-offering was found. If so, the owners have already received atonement. This guiltoffering needs to graze until it becomes blemished; they then sell it and buy a burnt-offering with its value. Rashi is explaining specifically that even though its value is destined to be used for the @hh<HEB>קיץ מזבח@ee<ENG> (when there were not enough sacrifices donated to keep the altar fully in use, the deficit was made up by Temple-funded sacrifices. This money is used to buy sacrifices for the “summertime altar”), if they slaughtered it without any designation it is not valid for a burnt offering before it is removed for pasture. Once it was removed for pasture, however, if it was slaughtered without any designation, it is valid. This is because it is written, “it is a guilt-offering,” implying: But not a burnt-offering. However, it is obvious that it is a guilt-offering and not a burnt-offering! Rather, this implies that sometimes it @ITcan@it be a burnt-offering. For instance: if it was removed for pasture and they slaughtered it without designation, it will be valid as a burnt-offering. @BOEven though [its fats] have not been burnt@bo. I.e., since the guilt-offering is valid even if the fats were not burnt, it is no longer applicable to say that a guilt-offering brought for its own sake is valid but if not for its own sake is invalid. Because if you were to say this, the guilt-offering would have to have the fats burnt for its own sake, since “it is a guilt-offering” is written after the burning of the fats. [But this is not so,] for if the fats were not burnt it would still be valid, since atonement is only accomplished by the blood. @p1[7]@p2<TIE>The one who is fit to [accomplish] atonement. @boMeaning: The phrase “One law applies to them both” is connected to the phrase following, “the @ITkohein@it who will bring about atonement .<TIE>.<TIE>.” for if it meant to equate the sinoffering and guilt-offering [this cannot be,] since it is already written: “As the sin-offering is, so is the guilt-offering,” in which they are equated. @p1[8]@p2<TIE>Excluding a @HB<HEB>טבול יום@BO<ENG> (one who has entered a mikveh, but who has to wait for sunset to become ritually pure).@bo Meaning: the sunset has not yet come. @BOA @HB<HEB>מחוסר כפורים@BO<ENG>.@bo Meaning: Sometimes there is an impure person [that has entered the mikveh] who needs to bring a sacrifice the next day. @BOWho do not share@bo. Excluding a @hh<HEB>טבול יום@ee<ENG>. Even though Scripture excluded them from a share in the meat, as stated above (v. 7), I might think that specifically with regard to the meat, which is eaten, and these kohanim are not fit to eat now — therefore, Scripture excludes them. Regarding the skins, however, since they are not fit to be eaten, I might think that although these kohanim are not fit for performing service, nonetheless they share in the skins. Therefore, it lets us know .<TIE>.<TIE>. [that since they are not fit for performing service or eating,] they are excluded from sharing in the skins. @p1[9]@p2<TIE>To the priestly family@bo. Meaning: The kohanim were divided into twenty-four watches, and each watch had one week. Each watch was divided into six priestly families for the six weekdays, each day had one priestly family [assigned to it], and on the Shabbos day all six priestly families served together. Many raise the difficulty: It is written later (v. 10), “[It shall belong] to all the sons of Aharon,” with regard to the @ITmeal-offering mixed with oil or dry@it, and Rashi writes later: The verse which says: “to the @ITkohein@it who offers,” is written concerning the @ITmeal-offering baked in an oven@it — why do we not say that there exists a difference between different types of mealofferings, that this one goes to the one who offers and this one is for all the sons of Aharon? It seems to me [that we can answer] in this way: When it says, “the @ITkohein@it who offers,” it cannot mean strictly him, and that the members of the watch have no rights in it. This is because perforce the watch must be included, since “the one who offers” refers to anyone who was fit to offer, just as nearby (v. 7), “the @ITkohein@it who will bring about atonement,” Rashi explains that “anyone who is fit to [accomplish] atonement has a share in it.” If so, it cannot be that only the @ITkohein@it who offers shall have a share. Rather, perforce it means anyone who was fit [to offer] in that watch [has a share]. Then afterwards, concerning the meal-offering mixed with oil, when it says, “to all the sons of Aharon,” perforce it means to all the members of that watch as well, for certainly, it cannot be referring to all the kohanim in the world, since it would be impossible to share it with everyone. If so, Scripture poses a contradiction in the usage of language: First it uses a singular term to refer a watch [“the @ITkohein@it who offers”], and afterwards a plural term, “to all the @ITsons@it of Aharon.” Rather, we must say there is relevancy for the singular and plural terms. And that is that each watch had priestly families, for there were twenty-four watches, and each watch was divided into six priestly families; each priestly family had its day. Therefore, the singular term usage mentioned first is fine, because it excludes all the other [i.e., twenty-three] priestly families. And the verse, “to all the @ITsons@it of Aharon” includes all those kohanim who were serving on that day, and not just the @ITkohein@it who offers it (@ITDivrei Dovid@it). @p1[10]@p2<TIE>A voluntary mealoffering@bo. Meaning: This is the voluntary fine flour meal-offering mentioned in Parshas Vayikro (2:1), for the other types have already been listed, as it is written: “Every meal-offering that shall be baked in an oven and every one made in a deep pot or frying pan<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” If so, “Every meal-offering mixed with oil” must be identified as the fine flour meal-offering.<QC>
@p1[12]@p2<TIE>So it is set forth in Menochos@bo. It says here (v. 14): “@hh<HEB>תרומה ליי@ee<ENG> (separated portion to Hashem),” and it says with regard to@hh<HEB>תרומת מעשר @ee<ENG> (the tithe of the tithe): “@hh<HEB>תרומה ליי@ee<ENG>” (Bamidbar 18:26), just as later on it means one tenth, here, too, it means one tenth. Thus, we learn that each type [of bread] should be ten loaves. This is because if they were less than ten or more than ten, then the tenth of each type would be a piece of a loaf or half a loaf. The Torah however says, (v. 14): “@ITone@it from each offering,” which means one @ITwhole@it loaf from each type; he should not take a piece. @BOTwenty esronos @bo(tenths). This is because it is written here (v. 13): “@hh<HEB>לחם חמץ@ee<ENG> (leavened @ITbread@it),” and with regard to the loaves of Atzeres (Shavuos) is written: “@hh<HEB>לחם תנופה שתים שני עשרונים@ee<ENG> (two @ITbread@it wave-offerings; of two tenths)” (23:17). If so, we derive [from a @ITgezeiroh@it @ITshovoh@it] “@hh<HEB>לחם לחם@ee<ENG>” — just as each bread mentioned concerning Atzeres was one ‘tenth,’ [so too, here, each leavened bread was one ‘tenth’]. Here, there were ten loaves of leaven, since each type had ten loaves. If so, the amount of bread was ten ‘tenths.’ The total of the rest of the three types [of matzoh] was only ten ‘tenths,’ [thus, the total of all the four types was twenty ‘tenths’]. [You might ask:] How does Rashi know this? Perhaps each type [even of matzoh] was ten ‘tenths’! [The answer is:] If so, Scripture should have written, “And leavened bread<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” why does it say: “@ITWith loaves — @it[leavened] bread [he shall bring]<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”? It had already specified above the three types of leaves! Rather, it comes to tell you that the loaves should resemble the [leavened] bread, i.e., all the loaves [of matzoh] should only be ten ‘tenths’ as was the [leavened] bread by itself. @BOScalded in boiling water as much as needed@bo. Rashi does not intend to say that they were scalded in boiling water but not baked afterwards in an oven. Rather, they are required to be baked after the scalding, as it is written clearly regarding the meal-offering (6:14): “@hh<HEB>תופיני@ee<ENG> (well-baked).” Then, we derive from the words “@hh<HEB>מורבכת מורבכת@ee<ENG> (saturated, saturated)” for a @ITgezeiroh@it @ITshovoh@it. @p1[13]@p2<TIE>That the bread is not holy@bo. Otherwise, why does it need to say: “He shall bring his offering, along with his peaceoffering of thanksgiving”? It is written above (v. 12): “He shall bring along with his thanksgiving offering matzoh loaves<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”! Perforce this verse comes for to be elucidated: “[This tells us] that the bread is not holy, etc.” Accordingly, the phrase, “Loaves of leavened bread,” is expounded with the preceding verse and the phrase following: With the preceding — “matzoh loaves mixed with oil .<TIE>.<TIE>. and loaves of saturated fine flour mixed with oil, with loaves of leavened bread, etc.” and with the phrase following — “With loaves of leavened bread he shall bring his offering, along with his peace-offering of thanksgiving.” @p1[14]@p2<TIE>One bread of each type@bo. Rashi is answering the question: There was only one @hh<HEB>קרבן@ee<ENG> (offering) — the peaceoffering of thanksgiving! [How, then, can the verse say, “one from each @hh<HEB>קרבן@ee<ENG>”?] Therefore, he explains: “One @ITbread@it of each type, etc.” because each type is called a @hh<HEB>קרבן@ee<ENG>. @p1[15]@p2<TIE>The festal offering of the fourteenth@bo. [You might ask:] On the verse in Parshas Re’eh (Devarim 16:4): “Neither shall any of the flesh remain all night until the morning,” Rashi explains: “Scripture is referring to the festal offering brought on the fourteenth of Nissan [and not to the Pesach offering], and it teaches with reference to it that it may be eaten for @ITtwo@it days and [the intervening] night”! [Yet here he writes that it may be eaten for @ITone@it day and a night]. [The answer is:] Rashi’s explanation here is according to the view of Ben Teima, who said that a festal offering that comes with a Pesach offering is eaten one day and a night, like the Pesach offering. And what Rashi says [in Parshas Re’eh that it is eaten] for two days, etc. is according to the Rabbis who disagree with Ben Teima. They hold the view that a peace-offering that comes because of the Pesach offering is eaten for only one day and a night, solely when it is a specific case of a peace-offering that comes from the surplus of a Pesach offering. For instance, someone separated money for his Pesach offering and he bought a Pesach offering, but there was a surplus of money. From that money he should bring a peace-offering. But since it originates from the Pesach offering, its laws are as that of the Pesach offering, to be eaten for one day and a night. Do not question why Rashi explains here according to the view of Ben Teima and later on according to the view of the Rabbis, since this is Rashi’s approach in a number of places in his commentary on the Chumash. @BOThe time limit of its bread@bo. As it is written: “On the day @ITof its sacrifice@it,” and it is not written: “On its day it may be eaten.” Rather, this is to tell you that [the laws pertaining to] the loaves should be like the sacrifice itself with [the laws pertaining to] eating, because the loaves are also called a @hh<HEB>קרבן@ee<ENG> (sacrifice), as it is written (v. 14): “@hh<HEB>והקריב אחד מכל קרבן@ee<ENG> (he shall bring one from each offering).” @BOUntil midnight@bo. Rashi is answering the question: Why did the Rabbis say that he may eat it only until midnight and not later? @p1[16]@p2<TIE>Thanksgiving for a miracle@bo. Meaning: That which is written: “If either a vow or voluntary offering,” does not mean that what is written above it is not referring to voluntary offerings, because above it does refer to a voluntary offering! Therefore, Rashi explains: “Which he did not bring as thanksgiving<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” however, until now it refers to one who brings an offering for thanksgiving for a miracle. @BOMay be eaten@bo. It may be eaten on the second day. You should not explain that it may be eaten on the first day, and on the next day it may also be eaten, and the remnant of it, i.e., of the second day, may be eaten on the third day. Rather, this is what it means: And on the next day the remnant from the first day may be eaten, meaning: what remained from the first day may be eaten on the second. According to this, the @hh<HEB>ו@ee<ENG> of @hh<HEB>והנותר@ee<ENG> is superfluous. Rashi’s proof is that it is written nearby (v. 18): “If it will be eaten .<TIE>.<TIE>. on the third day<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” [You might ask:] Why does Rashi not interpret this @hh<HEB>ו@ee<ENG> like the @hh<HEB>ו@ee<ENG> of (6:8): “@hh<HEB>ומשמנה@ee<ENG> (and some of its oil),” where he explains [that the @hh<HEB>ו@ee<ENG> of @hh<HEB>ומשמנה@ee<ENG> is a @hh<HEB>ו@ee<ENG> of explanation, meaning as if it is written:] @ITAnd@it from where does he take the fistful? — @hh<HEB>ומשמנה@ee<ENG> — where the oil is plentiful. So too, here, let it be explained: @ITAnd@it when is it permitted to eat on the next day? When the remnant is from the first day. However, the preferred way to fulfill the mitzvah is [to eat it] on the first day alone. This, indeed, is as Re’m wishes to explain. [The answer is:] Because if so, Scripture should write: “@hh<HEB>יאכל והנותר ממנו ממחרת@ee<ENG> (the remnant of it shall be eaten @ITon the next day@it),” [and not: “And on the next day, the remnant of it may be eaten”], so that we would not err to explain that it is referring to the remnant from the second day, which is to what it seems to refer, rather than explaining that it refers to the first day. Thus, the @hh<HEB>ו@ee<ENG> is certainly superfluous. Above (6:8), however, there is no reason to err. Here, though, @ITwithout@it the @hh<HEB>ו@ee<ENG> there is no reason to err, therefore, Rashi explains that the @hh<HEB>ו@ee<ENG> is superfluous. This answers the difficulty which Re’m raised on Rashi who did not explain this @hh<HEB>ו@ee<ENG> like the @hh<HEB>ו@ee<ENG> of @hh<HEB>ומשמנה@ee<ENG>. @p1[18]@p2<TIE>One who intends during the slaughtering@bo. Meaning: If he had an invalid intention about it at the time the @ITkohein@it sprinkles its blood, that is, to eat it on the third day, which is beyond its permitted time, then it is invalid. But after it was sacrificed, and all of its service was properly performed, no intention or action can invalidate it. @BOShould become invalid retroactively@bo. We should not raise the difficulty: Since the sacrifice was done properly, how could he make it invalid afterwards by the manner in which he eats it? The Sages already answered in Toras Kohanim: Just as we find concerning a zov and a zovoh, and one who counts a day against a day, who were in the presumption of being pure, yet when they see [a discharge] the day is removed from its presumption of purity, so too, here. @BOThis should not enter the mind@bo. Meaning: This is why the verse uses the term: “@hh<HEB>לא יחשב@ee<ENG>” to tell you that it is with thought (@hh<HEB>מחשבה@ee<ENG>) that it becomes invalid. And this is what it means: “The one who brings it,” that is, at the time of bringing the sacrifice, “@hh<HEB>לא יחשב לו@ee<ENG>,” meaning: He should not have the aforementioned thought: “it will be eaten .<TIE>.<TIE>. on the third day.” @BOAnd if he thought of it, “it will be an abomination.” @boMeaning: If he transgressed and thought. Rashi rectifies a number of matters in his paraphrase of this verse. He explains “@hh<HEB>המקריב אותו@ee<ENG>” as referring to the time of bringing the sacrifice, as aforementioned, and not as referring to the @ITkohein@it who brings it, as implied by the plain understanding. Also, he explains “@hh<HEB>לא יחשב לו@ee<ENG>” as a prohibition on thought, and not as a matter of [not] being credited. Additionally, he added the word @hh<HEB>זאת@ee<ENG> to teach that the thought about which he is cautioned against having is @ITthis@it thought: “it will be eaten .<TIE>.<TIE>. on the third day,” which is the thought of eating beyond the prescribed time. However, a thought [of eating] outside of the prescribed @ITplace@it is derived from the verse, “if it should be eaten .<TIE>.<TIE>. on the third day” in Parshas Kedoshim (19:7), as Rashi explains there: “If this does not refer to [the prohibition of eating it] beyond its [proper] time, etc.” Also, he adds the words “if he thought” before the words, “it will be an abomination,” because otherwise it would be understood from the verse that when the @ITkohein@it does @ITnot@it think that he will eat it beyond its time it will be an abomination. @BODuring the time limit. @boDuring the [prescribed] time it is also an abomination since its invalidity is in thought at the time of slaughtering or sprinkling. Therefore, Rashi emends: “[even] during the time limit.” @p1[19]@p2<TIE>Peace-offerings@bo. This excludes the just mentioned @hh<HEB>פיגול@ee<ENG>, which is not eaten even without touching impurity. @BOA limb, part of which went out@bo. Meaning: It went out of the courtyard, or, [with regard to] holy things of lesser holiness — outside the walls of Yerushalayim. The meat of an offering that goes outside [of its prescribed limits] is prohibited to be eaten because (Shemos 22:30): “You must not eat flesh that was torn off in the field.” The part that remains within [its prescribed limits] is permitted even though it touches the part that went out [its prescribed limits, and we do not say [that just as] something that touches the impure becomes impure, [i.e., if part of it becomes impure the entire thing becomes impure,] so too, [if part of the meat of an offering becomes] invalid [because it went outside, the entire meat should be considered invalid]. [This is] because the second word @hh<HEB>והבשר@ee<ENG> comes to include, since it should say, “@hh<HEB>כל טהור יאכל בשר@ee<ENG> (every pure person may eat the meat),” and no more, why does it say @hh<HEB>והבשר@ee<ENG>? Rather, it comes to include that this [i.e., the part of the meat that remains within its prescribed limits] is permitted. @BOTherefore@bo. [Re’m poses the difficulty:] You might ask: Why does the verse need to teach me this? It can be derived from the fact Scripture needs to write concerning the Pesach offering that it may only be eaten by its “subscribers” (the members of the group that purchased it), who are the owners. This implies that peace-offerings, which are eaten for two days and a night, may be eaten by any person. Because if you were to assume that peace-offerings are eaten only by the owners, why does the Torah single out the Pesach offering, about which the Merciful One wrote that it is eaten only by the owners? According to this assumption, we could learn from peaceofferings, which are lenient, in that they may be eaten for two days and in any [form of] food [preparation], yet even so they may be eaten only by the owners; the Pesach offering, which is more severe, in that it may be eaten only one day and night, and it is eaten only roasted, is it not so much more so [that it may be eaten only by the owners]? The answer is: Were it not for this verse, I might think that the rest of the peace-offerings may be eaten only by the owners, and yet the verse concerning the Pesach offering is needed for itself, [to teach] that they are considered owners only if they “subscribed” to it before it was slaughtered, but after slaughtering they may not subscribe. This is not the case by other peace-offerings — even if some people became partners after slaughtering they are permitted to eat from it. However, if they do not join as partners they may not. For this reason, the verse is needed to teach this, so it appears to me (@ITMinchas Yehudah@it). Re’m answers: Were it not for the verse: “Every pure person [may eat the meat<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.],” the verses would contradict each other: It is written concerning the Pesach offering (Shemos 12:4): “You shall make your count regarding the lamb,” which teaches that the Pesach offering is eaten only by the owners. This implies that peace-offerings may be eaten even by those who are not the owners, for if only the owners [may eat peace-offerings], Pesach should be derived from a @ITkal@it @ITvachomer@it from peaceofferings, as previously mentioned. [On the other hand,] it is written (Devarim 12:27): “And the blood of your sacrifices shall be poured .<TIE>.<TIE>. and @ITyou@it shall eat the flesh.” This implies that peace-offerings may be eaten only by the owners. For this reason the Merciful One wrote the verse: “Every pure person<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” to teach that the verse [in Devarim] “and [you shall eat] the flesh” is not meant to be interpreted precisely as referring only to the owners. Rather, any pure person [may eat] even if he is not an owner.<QC>
 @p1[20]@p2<TIE>Bodily uncleanness@bo. We derive a @ITgezeiroh@it @ITshovoh@it from the words @hh<HEB>טומאתו טומאתו@ee<ENG>: It is written here: “@hh<HEB>וטומאתו עליו@ee<ENG>, (while his uncleanness is yet on him),” and it is written there in Parshas Parah (Bamidbar 19:13): “@hh<HEB>עוד טומאתו בו@ee<ENG> (and his uncleanness remains upon him).” Just as there it refers clearly to impurity of the person (ibid.): “Whoever touches a corpse,” so too, here, it refers to impurity of the person. Rashi explains the later phrase: “@hh<HEB>וטומאתו עליו@ee<ENG>,” before he explains the preliminary [point]: “The warning for an unclean person who ate clean [sacrificial meat], etc.” because at first I might think that “@hh<HEB>וטומאתו עליו@ee<ENG>” refers to impure meat, and if so, it has a warning from the strength of the verse (19): “The flesh [of offerings] that will touch [any unclean thing may not be eaten],” and the punishment from the strength of this verse: “while his uncleanness is yet on him, [that person’s soul] shall be cut off.” [It is a generally accepted rule in regard to prohibitions and punishments in Vayikro that every punishment must be accompanied by a warning in another verse]. However, now that he explains that “@hh<HEB>וטומאתו עליו@ee<ENG>” refers to bodily uncleanness, it only speaks here of a warning for the meat’s uncleanness and the punishment for bodily uncleanness. The warning [for bodily uncleanness], though, is from the strength of the @ITgezeiroh@it @ITshovoh@it. That is: here it is written @hh<HEB>טומאתו@ee<ENG>, and [it also says @hh<HEB>טומאתו@ee<ENG>] by an impure person who enters the Beis HaMikdash, concerning which it states a warning and punishment. Thus, here, too, it has a warning. Afterwards, Rashi raises the difficulty: If so, why does it need to mention @hh<HEB>כרת@ee<ENG> again regarding bodily uncleanness? [He answers:] There are three @hh<HEB>כריתות@ee<ENG> (@ITDivrei Dovid@it). @BONot explicitly mentioned@bo. Rashi is answering what you might ask: There is no punishment [for a prohibition] unless there is a warning [in the Torah]! Therefore, he explains: “[The warning<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.] is not explicitly [mentioned in the Torah].” @BODerived it with a @HB<HEB>גזרה שוה@ee@BO<ENG>. @boThe @hh<HEB>גזרה שוה@ee<ENG> is written in Parshas Chukas (Bamidbar 19:13), @hh<HEB>טומאתו בו@ee<ENG> as previously mentioned. And [the punishment of] @hh<HEB>כרת@ee<ENG> (ibid.), and its warning is written in Parshas Naso, as it is written (5:3): “And they not defile their camps, in which I dwell among them,” which is a warning not to enter the Beis HaMikdash with bodily uncleanness. We derive [through a @ITgezeiroh@it @ITshovoh@it] @hh<HEB>טומאתו@ee<ENG> that is written here from @hh<HEB>טומאתו@ee<ENG> written there, just as @hh<HEB>טומאתו@ee<ENG> there has a warning, so too @hh<HEB>טומאתו@ee<ENG> here has a warning. @BOThree @HB<HEB>כריתות@ee@BO<ENG>.@bo One in Parshas Emor (22:3): “any person of your offspring who will draw near to the holy things .<TIE>.<TIE>. [while his impurity is on him, that soul shall be cut off].” The Gemara says in Zevachim Chapter 4 that when it says “who will draw near” it refers to eating: What does it mean, “who will draw near”? It is said concerning something that is fit to be brought near [the altar]. And how is that so? Because it had already been consecrated in a holy vessel. The other two @hh<HEB>כריתות@ee<ENG> are mentioned in Parshas Tzav (v. 20): “The person who eats of the flesh of the peace-offering,” and the next verse (v. 21) reads: “A person who touches anything unclean.” Concerning both of these it says: “[that person’s soul] shall be cut off.” [Rashi explains:] “One is [to teach] a general rule” — meaning: The one [in Parshas Emor]: “to the holy things,” which includes everything. One from the two mentioned in Parshas Tzav [teaches the rule regarding] a particular case. This is a rule [handed down at Sinai as a method of expounding the Torah] explained in Toras Kohanim, in the beginning of the sefer: Something that was included in a general rule, and [then] was singled out from that rule to teach, was not singled out to teach only about itself, but rather to teach about that entire general rule. How is that so? [Peace-offerings need not have been mentioned separately:] “The person who eats of the flesh of the peace-offering, etc.” since peace-offerings were included in the general category of “to the holy things.” Why then, did they depart [as a separate category here]? To compare to them — just as peace-offerings are special in that they are brought to the altar, so too, anything else that is brought to the altar [is included in the punishment of @hh<HEB>כרת@ee<ENG>]. This excludes animals dedicated to the Temple upkeep that one is not liable to the punishment of @hh<HEB>כרת@ee<ENG> [if he eats their flesh] while in a state of impurity. @BOAnd one to teach regarding a sliding-scale sacrifice. @boAs it is written in Parshas Vayikro (5:2): “and this [impurity] was concealed from him, he is impure and incurs guilt.” We would not know why he incurs guilt. Could it be that because he was impure he should incur guilt and bring a sliding-scale sacrifice? Therefore, this [third] @hh<HEB>כרת@ee<ENG> was made available to teach that [the sliding-scale sacrifice] comes to atone for this @hh<HEB>כרת@ee<ENG>, referring to [a person in the state of impurity who ate] sacrificial meat. [However,] if this does not refer to sacrificial meat [eaten by a person] in [the state of] impurity [then it should be used to teach something else]. [It is not needed] because it is [already] derived from a @ITgezeiroh@it @ITshovoh@it: Regarding the sliding-scale sacrifice it is written (ibid.): “or the carcass of an @ITimpure animal@it of pasture,” and it says concerning one who eats sacrificial meat in the state of bodily uncleanness in Parshas Tzav (v. 21): A person who touches [anything unclean] .<TIE>.<TIE>. or an @ITimpure animal@it .<TIE>.<TIE>. and then eats some flesh [of the peace-offering].” Just as later on [in Parshas Tzav] it refers to sacrificial meat in impurity, so too, here, [regarding the sliding-scale sacrifice] it refers to sacrificial meat in impurity. Thus, [since it is not needed for this], it should be used to teach about one who enters the Temple in impurity. @p1[24]@p2<TIE>{Fat .<TIE>.<TIE>.] does not acquire uncleanness@bo. Meaning: If [the verse came] to permit deriving benefit, [it would be unnecessary] since one is permitted to derive benefit from a @hh<HEB>נבלה@ee<ENG> (the carcass of an animal which has been slaughtered improperly), as it is written (Devarim 14:21): “To the stranger that is in your gates<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” thus, the fat is also included. Perforce, it comes [to teach] that the fat does not cause impurity of @hh<HEB>נבלה@ee<ENG> and may even be used for oiling the hides of animals dedicated to the Temple upkeep. For this reason it is written, “may be used for any purpose.” @BOAnd fall on the prohibition of @bo@hh<HEB>חלב@ee<ENG>. [Although Rashi writes, “he will be liable for the prohibition of @hh<HEB>נבלה@ee<ENG>”] the same applies to the prohibition of @hh<HEB>טריפה@ee<ENG> (an animal which died of natural causes, or would have died of such causes had it not been slaughtered). Rashi needs to mention both of these examples: the fat of a @hh<HEB>נבלה@ee<ENG> and the fat of a @hh<HEB>טריפה@ee<ENG>, for if it let us know only @hh<HEB>נבלה@ee<ENG>, I would say that regarding @hh<HEB>נבלה@ee<ENG> a prohibition falls on another prohibition because it acquires a severe impurity, but regarding @hh<HEB>טריפה@ee<ENG> it does not. And if it let me know only concerning @hh<HEB>טריפה@ee<ENG>, [I would say that regarding @hh<HEB>טריפה@ee<ENG>] a prohibition falls on another prohibition because it is a prohibited while still alive, but regarding @hh<HEB>נבלה@ee<ENG> it is not. For this reason, both are necessary. @p1[26]@p2<TIE>Excluding the blood of fish and grasshoppers@bo. Otherwise, why does it say, “be it of fowl or beast”? However, we should not say it excludes the blood of wild beasts (@hh<HEB>חיה@ee<ENG>). This cannot be, because @hh<HEB>חיה@ee<ENG> is included in the word @hh<HEB>בהמה@ee<ENG>. It not only excludes [the blood of] fish and grasshoppers, but also human blood. This is because this verse follows the rule [of Torah interpretation handed down at Sinai] of a general rule that is followed by a specific rule (@hh<HEB>כלל ופרט@ee<ENG>) — that the general rule includes only what is specified in the specific detail — fowl or @hh<HEB>בהמה@ee<ENG>. Other blood, however, that is not the blood of fowl or @hh<HEB>בהמה@ee<ENG>, is not included. @BOIt applies in all habitations@bo. You might ask: Why does Rashi reverse the order and not explain according to the order of the verse? The answer is: Without this [that Rashi first explains “be it of fowl or beast”], I might say that “in all your dwelling places” comes to include that everything in your dwelling places would be prohibited, even [the blood of] fish and grasshoppers. Now, however, that it is written, “be it of fowl or beast,” which excludes [the blood of] fish and grasshoppers, if so, it raises a difficulty: Why do I need, “in all your dwelling places”? Rather, it must be coming to teach us that it applies even outside of Eretz Yisroel since it is an obligation of the individual. You might ask: It is obvious that since it is an obligation of the individual that it applies whether in Eretz Yisroel, etc. [so why do we need the inclusionary phrase?] Therefore, Rashi explains: And in Maseches Kiddushin [it is explained why it was necessary to state this]. It is explained there: If Scripture did not write, “in all your dwelling places,” I might assume that since it is included within the general discussion of sacrifices, when the sacrifices are extant [i.e., when the Beis HaMikdash is standing] the fat and blood are prohibited, but when there are no sacrifices, they are not prohibited. Therefore, it teaches us [that these prohibitions apply to all times]. Divrei@IT @itDovid answers why Rashi reverses the order and first explains “be it fowl or beast” and then “in all your dwelling places,” which appears earlier in the verse. This is because Scripture says (v. 25): “Anyone who eats fat [of an animal from] which is offered a fire-offering to Hashem<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Meaning: There is a prohibition of fat and blood specifically from an animal that is fit for sacrifices, however, there is no prohibition from what is not fit for sacrifices. Accordingly, the verse, “be it fowl or beast,” refers to “fowl” such as turtledoves and young pigeons; and “beast” refers to the type that is pure [for sacrifices], in particular. According to this, I would explain that when the verse says, “in all your dwelling places,” it comes to prohibit all types of blood, even [from animals] not fit for sacrifices. But now that the verse, “be it fowl or beast” excludes the blood of fish and grasshoppers, by the strength of a @hh<HEB>כלל ופרט@ee<ENG> (that the general rule includes only what is specified in the specific detail), and [thus] the general rule that is mentioned does not prohibit all the types, if so, there is a difficulty: Why do I need “in all your dwelling places”? Even without it, we know that it does not depend on whether or not it is fit for a sacrifice. Rather, the blood of every fowl and beast is prohibited. Therefore, Rashi cites the Gemara in Maseches Kiddushin which answers this. @p1[30]@p2<TIE>The @BIkohein@BO’s hand beneath@bo. Since it is written (Devarim 26:4): “And the @ITkohein@it will take the basket from your hand,” just as there [it refers to] the hand of the @ITkohein@it, so too, here, it refers to the hand of the @ITkohein@it. And yet it is written: “His hands shall bring it,” which refers to the [hands of the] owner. How [do we resolve the apparent contradiction]? “The owner’s hands should be [on top .<TIE>.<TIE>. with the @ITkohein@it’s hand beneath].”<QC>
@d1That three kohanim@bo. Although it would be sufficient with one, this is because “the glory of the king is when there is a multitude of people.” @BOSince it is said@bo. Meaning: Since it is written: “@hh<HEB>את החלב על החזה יביאנו@ee<ENG> (he shall bring the fat on the breast)” it did not need to additionally write: “@hh<HEB>את החזה@ee<ENG> (and the breast).” Therefore Rashi explains that the second phrase “@hh<HEB>את החזה@ee<ENG>” refers to the phrase “@hh<HEB>להניף אותו@ee<ENG> (to wave it),” as if it says: The only reason he brings the breast together with the fat is to wave with it. Were it not for this, I would think that the aforementioned phrase “the fire-offerings of Hashem” includes [both] the fat and the breast that appear in the verse after it. You might ask: It is clearly written in the next verse: “The @ITkohein@it shall burn the fat on the altar and the @ITbreast shall belong@it to Aharon and to his sons.” How, then, could we have assumed that the breast would also be [burnt] with the fire offerings? The answer is: Were it not for the verse: “And the breast to wave,” I would think that the verse (31), “The @ITkohein@it shall burn the fat on the altar and the breast shall belong to Aharon and to his sons” comes to teach that you should not say that even the breast is a fire offering, [which you might say] because it is written, “the fat on the breast.” However, it (v. 31) does not teach that the meat is not eaten as long as the fats are below the altar (see Rashi there). Now that it is written, “and the breast to wave,” which teaches us that the breast is not one of the fire offerings, the verse, “and the breast shall belong to Aharon and to his sons” remains available to teach that the meat is not eaten while the fats are below the altar (@ITRe’m@it). Were it not for the verse, “and the breast to wave,” I might think that part of the breast is for a fire offering and part is for Aharon, as we say (3:4) regarding the liver. (@ITGur Aryeh@it) Gur Aryeh’s answer poses a difficulty: The liver is different, because it is written (ibid.): “@hh<HEB>יותרת על הכבד@ee<ENG> (the lobe on the liver)”; the expression @hh<HEB>על הכבד@ee<ENG> is extra. Therefore, the Sages derived that he should take a small part [of the liver with the lobe]. This is not so, here, regarding the breast, where the fat is placed upon it, and there is no extra expression. Thus, it appears to me that I might assume this is what it means: “His hands shall bring the fire-offerings of Hashem” refers to the fat and the breast, since both of them are relevant as fire offerings of Hashem. However, the Merciful One gave [the breast to] Aharon and his sons from the table of the Most High, and it would not be the property of the owner with which he could betroth a woman. Therefore, it teaches us know that the breast is not of the fire offerings of Hashem at all, and it is the property of the owner. With this, the language of the later verse is understandable as well (v. 34): “Because the breast wave-offering<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. I have taken from Bnei Yisroel .<TIE>.<TIE>. and I have given them to Aharon the @ITkohein@it.” This verse poses a difficulty: What new information does Scripture give here? According to what I mentioned it goes well: Scripture teaches us that they were taken from the Bnei Yisroel and not from the table of the Most High. Thus, what Hashem has given to them is the property of the owner (@ITDivrei Dovid@it).<QC>
@p1[33]@p2<TIE>Or at the time of burning@bo. Although above, regarding the sin-offering, Rashi writes only (6:19): “Excluding the one who is impure at the time of sprinkling the blood,” this is because Scripture writes here: “And the fat,” which implies that he needs to be pure at the time of burning the fat [as well] (@ITGur Aryeh@it). @p1[34]@p2<TIE>He moves them@bo. [Rashi knows this] because it is written (Shemos 29:27): “[Sanctify the breast of the wave-offering and the shoulder of the terumoh-offering] which were [the] waved and uplifted [parts].” The meaning of @hh<HEB>תנופה@ee<ENG> is waving to and fro, and @hh<HEB>תרומה@ee<ENG> is an expression denoting lifting up, and as a matter of course lowering.<QC>
@p1[37]@p2<TIE>For the day of installation of the @BIkehunoh@bi@bo. Every place where the expression “@hh<HEB>מלוי יד@ee<ENG>” (literally, filling the hand) appears, it means the installation, as above in Parshas Tetzaveh.<QC>
@p1[2]@p2<TIE>For there is no earlier@bo. The erecting of the Mishkan was on Rosh Chodesh Nissan, and this was on the twenty-third of Adar. The explanation of (v. 35): “At the entrance of the Tent of Meeting you shall sit .<TIE>.<TIE>. for seven days” is: In the place of the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, since for the entire seven days they would erect it and take it apart [and when it was taken apart there was no entrance’]. On Rosh Chodesh the Mishkan was erected and not taken apart, except during their travels. @BOWith words@bo. This is not from an expression of @hh<HEB>לקיחה@ee<ENG> (taking); this has already been explained in Parshas Bereishis (20:15) and other places (Bereishis 43:15, and more).<QC>
@p1[5]@p2<TIE>The things which you will see@bo. [Rashi is answering the question:] Nothing was mentioned earlier that Moshe could be referring to when he said, “This is the edict”! Therefore, Rashi explains: “The things which you will see.” @BOGod commanded me@bo. [Rashi adds this] because in the verse it does not mention Who commanded. [Therefore,] it was necessary to explain: “[Hashem] commanded me<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Although Moshe knew that in the end the honor would come and the Shechinah would dwell in his sacrifices, then, everyone would know as a matter of course that everything was a command of Hashem, nevertheless, he wanted to remove himself from even momentary suspicion (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it). @p1[9]@p2<TIE>On the turban@bo. See above in Parshas Tetzaveh (Shemos 28:37). @p1[11]@p2<TIE>I do not know@bo<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. The Ramban [suggests that the source of this command is] because it says regarding the altar (Shemos 40:10): “[Sanctify the altar] so that the altar becomes holy of holies,” which indicates that additional sanctification and sprinkling was necessary, more than [the sanctification] for the other vessels. But it appears to me it is because the altar was not like the other vessels of the Mishkan, in that the hollow of the altar was filled with earth and the anointing was for the copper [exterior] alone. However, there was no anointing for the earth that filled its hollow space. Therefore, he @ITsprinkled@it unto the altar in the place where they were bringing sacrifices after it was filled with earth. It needed @ITanointing@it because it was no less than other vessels (@ITGur Aryeh@it).<QC>
@p1[15]@p2<TIE>Purified it from any strangeness@bo. I.e., [Rashi is answering the question:] Who made the altar impure that it was necessary to purify it? On this he explains: “From any strangeness<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @BOWith this service@bo. Otherwise, with what did he sanctify it? @BOFrom now<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. @boAs if it says: He sanctified it so that he could make atonement upon it from now on.<QC>
@p1[16]@p2<TIE>Aside from the liver@bo. Here, the Torah does not say @hh<HEB>על הכבד@ee<ENG>, only Rashi writes it here. His proof is from what it says here @hh<HEB>יותרת הכבד@ee<ENG> (the lobe of the liver). If so, why does it mention in Parshas Tetzaveh (Shemos 29:13): “@hh<HEB>על הכבד@ee<ENG> (the lobe @ITon@it the liver),” and not @hh<HEB>יותרת הכבד@ee<ENG>, as it says here? Rather, the word @hh<HEB>על@ee<ENG> mentioned above is to expound that he takes a small part of the liver (@ITDivrei Dovid@it).<QC>
@p1[22]@p2<TIE>For they fulfill and complete@bo. The word @hh<HEB>מלואים@ee<ENG> written here is not an expression of installation, but rather an expression of wholeness: For they fulfill and complete, etc.<QC>
@p1[26]@p2<TIE>Use much oil@bo. Rashi is answering the question: Why is it not written @hh<HEB>חלת מצה שמן@ee<ENG> in the earlier part of the verse [and @hh<HEB>שמן@ee<ENG> would then refer to everything mentioned in the verse], or at the end: @hh<HEB>ורקיק שמן@ee<ENG>, and would then refer to everything mentioned beforehand? He explains: [That is the scalded dough, in which he would use much oil]. @p1[28]@p2<TIE>Moshe performed [the Temple service] all seven. @boRe’m writes: I do not know why Rashi explains this here and not on (v. 15): “and Moshe took the blood<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” where it would imply all the services that followed afterward were performed by Moshe. Perhaps the answer is: Rashi waited until the end of Moshe’s service. Additionally, we can say: Rashi is answering the question: Why did they burn the thigh on the altar? We do not find any thigh of a peaceoffering that was burnt, as Rashi writes nearby. And Rashi answers: “Moshe performed<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Regarding the breast and the thigh it is written that it shall be to Aharon and his sons as a portion (7:33, 34). For this reason Moshe burnt the thigh on the altar and it was not given to him as a portion, and only the breast [was given to him] to distinguish between him and Aharon and his sons, for they were the kohanim, and he was a Levi. He served only during the seven days of installation. Hashem made this distinction between Moshe and the kohanim, the sons of Aharon. Rashi did not write this above because there it was not necessary to say that Moshe served the entire seven days of installation. Rather, [one could say that] he served only on the first day to teach Aharon the details of service. The rest of the days, however, if they wished, Moshe could bring [sacrifices] to be burnt, or someone else, as long as he knew how to bring them [upon the altar] to be burnt. However, it is written here (v. 25-28): “He took the fat and the fat tail<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. He put them all on Aharon’s palms and on the palms of his sons and he waved<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. Moshe took them from their palms and he burned them on the altar in addition to the burnt-offering,” and this raises a difficulty: Why did Moshe perform all these services alone? Rashi explained (7:30) that waving requires three kohanim because the glory of the king is with a multitude of people! Therefore, perforce, no one else was fit to serve besides Moshe. Thus, one must say that Moshe served the entire seven days of installation (@ITGur Aryeh@it). @BOAfter the burnt-offering@bo. It does not literally mean @hh<HEB>על@ee<ENG> (upon), for he already burnt the burnt-offering before the slaughtering of this ram.<QC>
@p1[34]@p2<TIE>All seven days@bo. Meaning: This is a truncated verse, and it should have said: “Just as he did on this day, Hashem commanded him to do @ITall seven days@it.” This is because if the phrase, “Just as he did on this day” was meant to be connected with the verse above: “because for seven days your hands will be filled.” If so, the phrase, “Hashem commanded him to do” would remain by itself, without being understandable. However, our Rabbis expounded: “To do” — this refers to the ritual of the Red Heifer, “to bring about atonement,” — this [refers] to the ritual of Yom Kippur. If so, according to what they expounded, we must say that the phrase, “Just as you have done on this day” is connected with the previous phrase. And the statement, “Hashem commanded him to do” is a separate statement — that Hashem commanded to do the ritual of the Red Heifer; and [commands] the @ITKohein Godol@it “to bring about atonement for you” on Yom Kippur by the means of seclusion for seven days. @BOSeclusion seven days before Yom Kippur@bo. [I.e.,] just as these laws are required here they are also required there.<QC>
@p1[35]@p2<TIE>Thus, if you do not do so@bo. Otherwise, if it were not written to infer from it, why is “and you will not die” written at all? Certainly, they will not die when they observe Hashem’s mitzvos! Rather, it must have been written for the sake of the inference. @BODeath. @boMeaning: From the negative statement you can infer the positive one. This is because Scripture here only intends to punish someone who will not do so, and not to say that if he will do so he will not die, since the main “cutting” is the death penalty, Rashi found it necessary to say here that from the negative statement you can infer the positive one, as if it says that if you do not do so you will die. @p1[36]@p2<TIE>That they did not deviate@bo. Otherwise, why does Scripture write, “[Aharon and his sons] fulfilled”? It is obvious! Would a righteous man such as he not do, Heaven forbid, as he was commanded by Hashem? Re’m writes: Similarly, the Sages expounded in the Mechilta, regarding (Shemos 14:2,4): “Speak to the Bnei Yisroel and have them turn back<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. They did just that.” And in Parshas Acharei Mos, regarding (16:34): “He did as Hashem commanded Moshe,” and in Parshas Bo, regarding (Shemos 12:28): “The Bnei Yisroel went and did<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” and in Parshas Beha’aloscha, regarding (Bamidbar 8:22): “Just as Hashem had commanded Moshe.” However, in Parshas Beha’aloscha, regarding (ibid. 9:5): “So they made the Pesach offering .<TIE>.<TIE>. [so did the Bnei Yisroel do],” the Sages did not expound. Perhaps this is because they relied on what was expounded concerning the [first] Pesach itself in Parshas Bo. It appears to me: The reason the Sages did not expound in Parshas Beha’aloscha, regarding (ibid.): “So they made the Pesach offering<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” was because that entire section speaks of the Jewish people’s degradation, as Rashi explains: The entire forty years they were in the wilderness they made only this one Pesach offering, etc. For this reason the Sages did not expound concerning “So they made<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” as they did elsewhere. Furthermore, Re’m writes: “However, in Parshas Korach (Bamidbar 17:26) regarding: ‘Moshe did so, [he did just as Hashem had commanded him],’ concerning the matter of the staffs, the Sages did not expound anything, and I do not know why.” It seems to me the answer is because it is not applicable to expound there: To tell you his praise, etc., since Moshe was the messenger of Hashem, and it is presumed that a messenger fulfills his assignment. It is no praise for a messenger when he does the assignment of the one who sent him. However, the Bnei Yisroel, and Aharon and his sons, did according to the words of Moshe. They made no changes from all that he commanded them, and they believed that Moshe was sent [by Hashem]. For this, it is apropos to expound: “To tell you their praise.” So it appears to me.<QC>
@p1[1]@p2 Eighth [day] of the installation.@p3 Since it is written at the end of Parshas Tzav: “At the entrance of the Tent of Meeting you shall sit day and night<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. Aharon and his sons fulfilled<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” after which it is written: “And it was on the eighth day,” it surely refers to what came precedes it, those seven days, for we expound the juxtaposition [of the verses]. Furthermore, we can say that Scripture comes to elucidate and not to be unclear. Why, then, does it not specify which day it was? Rather, it must have been the eighth day (Rosh Chodesh Nison) of the installation, and it does not need to specify since it was juxtaposed to that verse. @d1That very day.@bo Rashi is answering the question: The verse comes to tell us when this happened, when it says: “And it was on the eighth day,” but we still do not know in which month the eighth day of installation was, or the date of the month. Because of this Rashi explains that it was Rosh Chodesh Nison. And Rashi means to say: The verse does not need to tell us that, for surely it was Rosh Chodesh Nison, because the Mishkon was erected on that very day, as it clearly says in Parshas Pekudei (Shemos 40:2). Since we have found that there was holiness on Rosh Chodesh Nison, then this [the eighth day of installation] was surely on Rosh Chodesh Nison as well, for we should assume that holiness occurs on a holy day. The verse relied on [this rationale], and it therefore did not specify the date. Additionally, Rashi is answering the question: How do we know the rationale to assume holiness occurs on a holy day — that [we should say] the verse relies on this logic? Therefore Rashi explains: And it took ten crowns which are taught in Seder Olom, i.e., we say in Seder Olam that this day took ten crowns. Why, though, did Hashem let it have all these virtues more than the other months? Perforce, it must be: This day was sanctified beforehand for the sake of the erection of the Mishkon, and we assume holiness occurs on a holy day. @d1Took ten@bo. For this reason it uses the indicative @hh<HEB>ה@ee<ENG>, the special eighth day, because of the ten crowns that it took. And they are: 1) The first day of the act of Creation, 2) first of the [Roshei] Chodashim, 3) first day of the princes’ [sacrifices], 4) first day of kehunah, 5) first day of Temple service, 6) of the fire descending, 7) of eating the sacrifices, 8) for the prohibition of individual altars, 9) for the presence of the Shechinoh in Yisroel, 10) for blessing the people of Yisroel. @d1Entered and served@bo. Rashi is answering the question: Why did he call the elders of Israel? We cannot say he wanted to speak to them so that they would tell the people of Israel to bring their offerings, because it is written afterwards (v. 3): “To @ITBnei Yisroel@it you [Aharon] shall speak, saying<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” To the elders, however, Moshe said nothing! Therefore, Rashi explains: “To announce to them<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” [You might ask:] Above, in the previous parshah, it is written (8:5): “Moshe said to the congregation, ‘This is the edict that Adonoy commanded,’” upon which Rashi explains: “You should not say that [it is] for my honor and for my brother’s honor [that] I do this.” If so, why does he need to announce to them a second time that it was by Divine command that Aharon entered to serve? The answer is: Here, Moshe came to let them know that it is by Divine command that Aharon entered to serve even as a @ITkohein godol@it, which is a different service than the service of an ordinary @ITkohein@it (@ITRe’m@it). [Alternatively,] the answer is: There, it refers to what they did during the seven days of installation, but here it refers to what he did on the eighth day. This is why Moshe mentioned above: “[You should not say that it is] for my honor” and here he speaks on Aharon’s behalf alone (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it).<QC>
@p1[2]@p2<TIE>For the deed of the [Golden] Calf@bo. You might ask: [There is a rule that] the prosecution cannot serve as the defense, as Rashi explains in Parshas Chukas (Bamidbar 19:22)! The answer is: That [rule] applies specifically regarding to the service performed inside [the Holy of Holies], such as the garments of kehunah û when the @ITkohein godol@it entered the most innermost, he would not wear any garments that had gold, because “the prosecution, etc.” There was no concern about this [rule], though, regarding the service performed outside. [Alternatively:] We need not ask: Since Aharon sinned with regard to the [Golden] Calf, this raises the concern that the prosecution cannot serve as the defense, as Rashi explains in Parshas Chukas. [The answer is:] It is different there, because the Red Heifer was to atone for all of Israel. If Aharon was making the atonement [instead of Elozor his son, see Rashi (ibid.)], there would be reason to be concerned that the prosecution cannot serve as the defense, but here, where he was atoning only for himself, this rule is not applicable. Re’m writes: However, that which Rashi says: “to let know that Hashem forgave him by means of this calf for the deed of the [Golden] Calf,” I do not know how it lets us know this. If it was because the honor of Hashem appeared to them by means of these offerings, which demonstrates that Hashem atoned by means of this calf for the deed of the [Golden] Calf — then even without this calf we would also know that since the honor of Hashem appeared to them by means of Aharon’s bringing the offerings he has already achieved atonement for his sin<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. It appears to me that Rashi derives this from what it is written: “Take, @ITfor@it @ITyourself@it, a young calf<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Why does it say, “for yourself”? It should only say, “Take a young calf<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” as it is written regarding the people (v. 3): “Take a he-goat<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Rather, perforce, since it is written, “Take, for yourself, a young calf for a sin-offering,” it means that the taking should be ‘for you,’ i.e., for your good: “To let us know [that Hashem forgave]<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Alternatively: Rashi’s proof is from that which Aharon was commanded about this calf for a sin-offering. Normally, the sin-offering of an anointed @ITkohein@it is a bullock, as it says in Parshas Vayikro (4:3). Why, then, did He command a calf for the sin-offering here? Rather, [it must be:] “To let know that Hashem forgave him by means of this calf for the deed of the [Golden] Calf which he made.” [This is from] Toras Kohanim. [The Sages made this drashah] because otherwise, why did Aharon take a calf whereas Israel [took] a he-goat? Rather, Aharon brought a calf because he sinned with a calf, and Israel [brought] a he-goat because they sinned with a he-goat — in that they dipped the tunic in blood [after selling Yosef]. You might ask: If so, this poses a difficulty with regard to the burnt-offering as well: Why was Israel’s burnt-offering a calf, and Aharon’s burnt-offering a ram? The answer is: Since Aharon sinned with an action, in that he made the Golden Calf, therefore he brought a sin-offering that is appropriate for a sinful deed. Israel, on the other hand, sinned in thought, for they erred by following after the Golden Calf, brought a calf as a burnt-offering, since a burnt-offering atones for [sinful] thought, as it is written (Yechezkel 20:32): “@hh<HEB>העולה על רוחכם@ee<ENG>” [the @hh<HEB>עולה@ee<ENG> is for what enters your mind]. This is because those who sinned [with the Golden Calf] by deed were [already] judged by Moshe with their appropriate judgment. Aharon, however, brought a burnt-offering, although he sinned with deed, because Aharon also sinned in thought, for in his mind he consented to make the Golden Calf (@ITGur@it @ITAryeh@it). @p1[4]@p2<TIE>To rest His Shechinoh<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. @boAs it is written (v. 24): “A fire came forth .<TIE>.<TIE>. and consumed<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” This is “on the work of your hands,” because this was [a demonstration of] extra affection in that the offerings were accepted. However, [the resting of His Shechinoh was] not [revealed] in that which it is written (v. 23): “and the glory of Adonoy appeared to the entire people.” This is because a number of times the glory of Hashem appeared when they were not commanded to bring offerings. Furthermore, sometimes the glory of Hashem appeared to them even for disaster (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it).<QC>
@p1[7]@p2<TIE>Aharon was ashamed@bo. [Rashi knows this] because it is not written: “Moshe said to Aharon: ‘Perform [the services of] your sin-offering<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.’” Why did Moshe need to say: “Approach the altar”? Furthermore, it already said (v. 2): “And bring them before Adonoy.” Rather, “[It was because Aharon was ashamed], etc.”<QC>
@d1Kid. @boRe’m writes: Rashi needs to explain that the people’s offering is the kid of goats, young calf, and lamb, to exclude the additional offerings of Rosh Chodesh that are also called “the people’s offering.” Because of these, he explains “your sin-offering and your burnt-offering<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” as well. You might ask: Why does Rashi need to explain this? Obviously, it definitely refers to the previously mentioned matter. Furthermore, Rashi explains, “wherever it states [@hh<HEB>עגל@ee<ENG> (a calf), it refers to a yearling] <TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” raises a difficulty: Why did he not explain this previously in verse (3) where it mentions “calf”? Re’m, too, points this out. There is another difficulty: We should also derive @hh<HEB>כבש@ee<ENG> (lamb) from here; why did Rashi not say: “wherever it states @hh<HEB>עגל או כבש@ee<ENG> (a calf @ITor a lamb@it)”? The answer is: I might have an erroneous assumption from the fact the verse uses a different expression, for with regard to Aharon it is written, “your sin-offering and your burnt-offering,” in a specific fashion, whereas regarding the people it is written, “the people’s offering,” in a general fashion, without specifying “their sin-offerings and their burntofferings.” Thus, it certainly [appears as though it] does not refer to the offerings mentioned previously. For this reason Rashi needs to explain that despite this, it does refer to the offerings mentioned previously. Rashi held the view that different expressions in the verse do not pose a difficulty at all. This is because regarding Aharon Scripture could not write the general term “your offerings,” since I would say it refers to the regular sin-offering brought by the @ITkohein godol@it, which is a bullock, for instance, the bullock of the anointed @ITkohein@it or the bullock of Yom Kippur. Therefore, it needs to specify “your sin-offering” — a young calf, etc. However, regarding the people there is no room for error, for their sin-offering was a kid goat, and also the regular communal sin-offering is a kid goat. @d1Wherever it states @HB<HEB>עגל@ee@BO<ENG> (a calf) it refers to a yearling@bo. Rashi needs to explain, so that you will not say since it is written regarding Aharon, “@hh<HEB>עגל בן בקר@ee<ENG>” and not just @hh<HEB>עגל@ee<ENG>, that it means to say an @hh<HEB>עגל בן בקר@ee<ENG> is the same as a bullock (@hh<HEB>פר@ee<ENG>), i.e., an @hh<HEB>עגל בן בקר@ee<ENG> is also three years old. [You might assume this] because the undesignated term @hh<HEB>עגל@ee<ENG> in the Torah refers to a two year old, except where it explicitly says “one year old.” Thus, as a matter of course, here, where it is written @hh<HEB>עגל בן בקר@ee<ENG>, it is three years old [(@hh<HEB>עגל@ee<ENG> = 2 years) + (@hh<HEB>בן בקר@ee<ENG> = 1) = 3]. If so, the aforementioned difficulty remains: Why does Scripture change the expression regarding Aharon, and does not write “your offerings” in an unspecified fashion? Because of this, Rashi explains: “Wherever it states @hh<HEB>עגל@ee<ENG> it refers to a yearling<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” You can learn, as a matter of course, that where it written @hh<HEB>בן בקר@ee<ENG> it is two years old. For this reason, Scripture could not write without being specific regarding Aharon, “your offerings,” for one would err and say that @hh<HEB>עגל בן בקר@ee<ENG> is the same as a @hh<HEB>פר@ee<ENG> [three years old]. Rather, wherever it says @hh<HEB>פר@ee<ENG> it is three years old, @hh<HEB>עגל בן בקר@ee<ENG> is two years old, and @hh<HEB>עגל@ee<ENG> undesignated is one year old, even if it does not specify clearly that it is one year old. “And from here you learn [this rule].” I.e., since Scripture uses a different term regarding Aharon, etc. as I explained. With this, Re’m’s difficulties are resolved, for he posed the difficulty: Why did Rashi not write this on the verse (v. 3): “and a calf and a lamb, both one year old”? Why did he wait until now? Similarly, why did he not say: “Wherever it states @hh<HEB>עגל בן בקר@ee<ENG> it refers to a two year old,” for both are true in Rashi’s view? Also, [this answers] that which Re’m asks: How does he know there is a @hh<HEB>בניין אב@ee<ENG> (comparison)? Perhaps, wherever it does not specify, it is two years old, except where Scripture clearly states otherwise. @p1[11]@p2<TIE>And all of them by Divine command@bo. Rashi is answering the question: Usually, the sin-offering is eaten! Alternatively: Rashi is answering the question: Since this entire section is about the avodah of the sin-offering, until (v. 12): “He slaughtered the burnt-offering,” Scripture should have written (v. 10): “Just as Adonoy commanded Moshe” after verse (11): “And the flesh<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” so that then it would refer to the entire section. Rashi answers: The burning of this sin-offering was not commanded to Moshe beforehand, only now, “for we do not find, etc. except this one and that of the installation.” For this reason, it was not written at the end [of the section] (@ITMinchas Yehudah@it). [You might ask:] Above, in [the parallel verse in] Parshas Tetzaveh (Shemos 29:14): Rashi explains: “We find no other outside sin-offering burnt @ITbesides this one@it” [and he does not mention the one of installation]! The answer is: He does not mean only this one; rather, this one and all that resemble it. For that one is also termed “one of installation.” It was only that the one [outside sin-offering] of the seven days of installation was for the inauguration of the kehunah, for from that point the designation of kehunah took effect upon them, although they did not yet begin avodah until the eighth day of installation. The one of the eighth day of installation was for the inauguration of the avodah. Similarly, the second young bull of the Levites in Parshas Behaloscha (Bamidbar 8:8), where Rashi explains: “What does it mean by ‘a second’? It teaches that just as a burnt-offering is not eaten, so is [this] sin-offering not eaten<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” This was also a sin-offering of installation, for the Levites were inaugurated with it for the avodah of the Levites (@ITRe’m@it).<QC>
@p1[15]@p2<TIE>As his calf. @boRashi is answering the question: Since it refers to the sin-offering (@hh<HEB>חטאת@ee<ENG>), which is a feminine noun, it should use [the feminine adjective form] @hh<HEB>כראשונה@ee<ENG> (as the first one)! He answers: The expression @hh<HEB>ראשון@ee<ENG> refers to the @hh<HEB>עגל@ee<ENG> (calf) which is also masculine. Therefore, Rashi did not use the expression @hh<HEB>כחטאת שלו@ee<ENG> (as his sin-offering). Alternatively, we can say that Rashi is answering this question: The expression of @hh<HEB>ראשון@ee<ENG> (the first one) implies that it refers to what is written previously. However, previously it mentioned a burnt-offering. How then could it say he should treat the law of a sin-offering like a burnt-offering? Therefore he explains: As his calf, i.e., it does not refer to what was mentioned previously; rather, [it refers to] what was mentioned ‘preceding what was mentioned previously,’ which is a sin-offering, that is: his calf (@ITRe’m@it). @p1[16]@p2<TIE>In a freewill burnt-offering@bo. Re’m writes: In Menachos (93b) and in Beitzah (20a): “The Tanna taught in front of Rabbi Yitzchok bar Abba: ‘He brought .<TIE>.<TIE>. and he did it @ITaccording to the rule’@it — as the rule of the freewill burnt-offering. This teaches that the obligatory burnt-offering requires laying [of hands]<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” We should not raise the difficulty: In Parshas Vayikro (1:4), Rashi explains on the verse: “the head of the burnt-offering” — [the word “burnt-offering” comes] to include an obligatory burnt-offering for laying [of hands]<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. If so, why do we need “according to the rule” to teach that the obligatory burnt-offering requires laying [of hands]? The answer is: The obligatory burnt-offering here is Aharon’s burnt offering that he brought on the eighth day, in which Scripture placed an obligation of the day on him. Above in Vayikro, Scripture comes to teach that an individual’s obligatory burnt-offering of generations requires laying [of hands]. Here, however, it speaks of the obligatory burnt-offering of [a specific] time, and one cannot derive the sacrifices of a specific time from sacrifices of generations. You might ask: How does Rashi know this [that it refers to the rule of freewill burnt-offering]? Perhaps it refers to the burnt-offering mentioned here, with regard to sprinkling the blood around the altar, with regard to cutting the limbs and washing the innards and the feet, as [we find concerning] the sin-offering (v. 15) which refers to the sin-offering mentioned here. The answer is: [Rashi knows this] from the fact that Scripture changes its language and writes regarding the sin-offering “as the first” but here [it writes] “according to the rule.” Perforce, we must say that “he did it according to the rule” means: as the customary rule of a burnt-offering. This must refer to the burnt-offering of Parshas Vayikro, where the customary rule of the burnt offering is detailed. @p1[17]@p2<TIE>Fistful. @boOtherwise, why would this meal-offering be different from the meal-offering of generations in Parshas Vayikro, more so than the burnt-offering? Could it be that the burnt-offering of [the specific] time was the same as the voluntary burnt-offering of generations, and yet the meal-offering of [the specific] time would not be the same as the mealoffering of generations? @d1After the [daily] burnt-offering@bo. Meaning: @ITIn addition@it to the burnt-offering of the morning, for if it meant: all these he did @ITwithout@it the burnt-offering of the morning, Scripture should write this at the end of the section after he brought the peace-offerings, because he offered the peace-offerings without the burnt-offering of the morning as well. Or, Scripture should write this at the beginning of the offering, and then it would reflect on the entire section. Why was it written specifically here? It is all right if we explain that all these he did @ITafter@it the morning burntoffering [as Rashi explains], then it is understandable why it is written specifically here: It comes to teach that these offerings were brought after the morning burnt-offering. But, if it was written at the end, it would imply that the peace-offerings as well were specifically after the morning burntoffering. This, however, is not so, because we can say there was no order for the peace-offerings in terms of which of them came first. Re’m explains: If so, it should say, “aside from the burnt-offering of the month,” as it says regarding the additional offerings of Shabbos, Rosh Chodesh, and Holidays. @p1[19]@p2<TIE>Covering the innards@bo. Rashi rectifies [the verse’s language] in that “the covering,” although it is unspecified, is none other than the fat covering the innards. This is because we do not find anything else called “the covering” besides for the fat covering the innards. @p1[20]@p2<TIE>To another @ITkohein@it to burn them@bo. Rashi is answering the question: In another place it is written (10:15): “The thigh that is the separated portion and the breast that is the wave-offering, on top of the fats of the fire offering,” implying that the thigh is on top and the fat below! In Parshas Tzav (7:30), Rashi explains this well.<QC>
@p1[22]@p2<TIE>May [He] bless you@bo. You might ask: Why does Rashi need to mention, “May [He] bless you, May [He] cause [His Face] to shine, May [He] lift up”? Since he mentioned Birkas Kohanim, surely it was, “May [He] bless you, May [He] cause [His Face] to shine, May [He] lift up”! The answer is: So that you will not raise the difficulty: How does Rashi know at all that he blessed them with Birkas Kohanim? Perhaps it was another blessing, such as the blessing of Shlomo, as it says (Melachim I, 8:22): “And he spread forth his hand<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Therefore, Rashi mentioned, “May [He] bless you, May [He] cause [His Face] to shine, May [He] lift up,” i.e., why did Aharon bless them? Because they offered a sin-offering, burnt-offering, and peace-offerings, which are alluded to in these blessings. See @ITBaal HaTurim@it [who explains the hints]. @d1From the altar@bo. And not that Aharon descended from the place of lifting his hands. According to this, the verse is reversed. Possibly, “he descended” can be explained: He had already descended. Examine what I wrote in Parshas Shemos on the verse (4:20): “And he returned to the land of Egypt and Moshe took the rod of Hashem in his hand.” Similarly, the Sages said in Toras Kohanim: “This verse’s text is distorted, and it should say: He descended after offering the sin-offering, the burnt-offering and the peace-offering, and Aharon raised his hands toward the people and he blessed them.<TIE>.<TIE>. [after he descended he raised his hands and blessed them].” The Sages in Megillah (18a) said the same (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it).<QC>
@p1[23]@p2<TIE>To teach him@bo. You might ask: How could they postpone bringing the incense until after all these offerings? [The Rabbis] taught [in a Mishnah] (Yoma 31b): The incense of the morning was brought between the sprinkling of the blood and the burning of the limbs. Furthermore, what did Moshe have to teach Aharon? Could it be that during the entire seven days of installation Moshe did not burn the incense in order to teach him [just as he brought the offerings to teach him]? The answer is: Scripture did not allow them to enter inside the entrance [of the Tent of Meeting] at all during the entire seven days of installation, as it is written (8:35): “At the entrance of the Tent of Meeting you shall sit day and night.” Since the incense is a service performed inside [the Tent of Meeting], Moshe could not teach Aharon during the seven days of installation, and he needed to teach him on the eighth day of the installation, after the Mishkon has already been erected and all the inner and outer services were permitted. Now, since the golden altar can be inaugurated only with the afternoon incense, as [the Rabbis] taught [in a Mishnah] (Menachos 49a), if so, the only purpose of the incense they burnt in the morning, before inaugurating the golden altar, was to teach Aharon so that he would know how to burn it in the afternoon. Because of this he was not concerned to burn it at the proper time, and he burnt it after bringing all the offerings (@ITRe’m@it). @d1May it be [His] Will that [the Shechinoh] should rest@bo. We should not say this was Birkas Kohanim, because Aharon had already blessed them. Furthermore, Moshe was a Levi; so how could he bless with the Birkas Kohanim?<QC>
@p1[2]@p2<TIE>Only because they rendered@bo. This raises a difficulty: There is no [liability for] punishment without a warning! I will answer this difficulty in the next comment. @d1Intoxicated with wine they entered@bo. [According to this] the explanation of “which He had not commanded them” is not the reason for their deaths. Rather, it only informs that they volunteered themselves to bring the incense, and not that He commanded them, as He had commanded Aharon (9:2): “Take, for yourself, a young calf<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” And the explanation of (16:1): “[After the death of two sons of Aharon] in their coming close (@hh<HEB>בקרבתם@ee<ENG>),” is: At the time of their bringing an offering, and not that they had died because of [using] a strange fire. Rather, the main reason for their death was because they were intoxicated with wine. If it were not that Hashem wanted to be sanctified by means of Nodov and Avihu, they would not have died now, even though death had already been decreed upon them at the time they peered [See Shemos 24:11, Rashi there: “They envisioned Hashem.” They (Nodov and Avihu) gazed at Him insolently while engaged in eating and drinking]. Similarly, they would not have died on this day which was a joyous occasion for Israel, if they had not rendered a halachic decision on this day. (See more about this in the following). Gur Aryeh answers that [although death was already decreed at the time of Matan Torah] since Hashem’s anger passes, as it is written (Yishayahu 26:20): “Hide for almost a moment, until the anger passes,” and since that anger had passed, another cause was necessary to be liable for death. Re’m poses another difficulty: They were liable for death from the time of the Golden Calf, as punishment for Aharon, and Moshe’s prayer only helped for half the decree — that two [of Aharon’s four] sons would die [see Rashi 10:12]. Nachalas Yaakov answers: According to the assumption that Aharon’s sons would die solely for the sin of the Golden Calf, Elozor and Isomor should have died, for they were presumably less righteous than, and they did not have as much merit as, Nodov and Avihu. Gur Aryeh answers: We find concerning the wicked that if they continue the deeds of their forefathers, Hashem punishes them for their forefathers’ deeds, so too, concerning a completely righteous person. If his son does any sin, Hashem punishes him for the deeds of his father, and if the son does not sin at all, Hashem does not bring the sin of the righteous man upon the son. This [concept] necessitates that when the sons sin, it is added to the forefathers’ sins and then the sons are punished even for the sin of the forefathers. [Thus,] the sin of the sons together [with the sin of the forefathers] causes the punishment. See Kitzur Mizrachi where he brings additional views: Rabbi Yossi HaGelili said: For drawing close, in which they entered the innermost (Holy of Holies) they died. Rabbi Akiva said: For drawing close, in that they brought a strange fire they died. Rabbi Elazar ben Azaryah said: Because of both reasons they died. Bar Kappara said in the name of Rabbi Yirmeyah ben Eliezer: Because of four things they died: 1) For coming close, 2) for the offering that they brought without being commanded, 3) for the strange fire, a fire from the Beis HaKirayim (house of ovens), and 4) because they did not ask advice from one another. @p1[3]@p2<TIE>That they are greater than I or you@bo. The difficulty is raised: Perhaps the sanctification needed to be with both of them [Nodov and Avihu], for one of them would not be sufficient, and the two of them together were greater. Thus, two were needed, and they were better than Moshe alone or Aharon alone. How does Rashi know they were greater than Moshe and Aharon together? Another difficulty: How could Moshe make such a big mistake in thinking that he and Aharon were greater than them, and yet [in truth] Nodov and Avihu were greater? It would be enough if Moshe thought that they were all equal, and he erred in [only] one level? It seems [that the answer is:] It is written: “@hh<HEB>בקרובי אקדש@ee<ENG> (through @ITthose@it that are near me I shall be sanctified),” and @hh<HEB>בקרובי@ee<ENG> with a @ITpasach@it is in the plural form. Moshe thought that they were all equal in goodness, and he said: I had known that the Temple would be sanctified with those singled out as special (@hh<HEB>במיודעיו@ee<ENG>) by the Omnipresent, and @hh<HEB>במיודעיו@ee<ENG> is in the plural form. I.e., two pairs are in the matter of “@hh<HEB>בקרובי אקדש@ee<ENG>” which is plural. If so, I thought: either me, and one of them, or you, and one of them, since we are all equal. But now that He did not want any of us, I see that they are greater than me or you (@ITRav Yaakov Trivash@it). @d1He received a reward@bo. Rashi is answering the question: Why is it written, “and Aharon was silent”? What could he have said about the decrees of Hashem? Could he challenge Hashem? With regard to this Rashi explains: He received a reward for his silence, i.e., for this reason it is written, “and [Aharon] was silent,” because he received a reward for his silence, for this reason Scripture writes, “and [Aharon] was silent.” Rashi reverses the order and explains “and Aharon was silent” before “through those that are near Me” in order to inform why Aharon was silent. Because he heard that his sons were Heaven fearing, near to, and singled out as special by Hashem. Therefore, he was silent. So, too, it is in the Midrash Rabboh (@ITGur Aryeh@it). The reason Rashi reverses the order is to prove why Aharon received reward for his silence. This is because in the natural order of things one who consoles does not praise the departed person in the presence of his relatives. On the contrary, they say words that are not painful to the mourner, such as we find concerning the daughter of R. Shmuel bar Yehudah (Bava Metzia 38a), where they told him that if something good was destined to come from her she would not have died. But here Moshe praised the departed ones in front of Aharon, [saying] that they were closer to Hashem than them. Aharon, then, should have intensified his crying, nevertheless, he was silent. Therefore, he was worthy of good reward (@ITDivrei Dovid@it). @d1To him alone@bo. I.e., [“To him, alone”] implies two [rewards]. Because of his silence he merited that he heard @ITdirectly@it the Divine command which he had not been privileged until now. This is because: “[Rabbi Yehudah says:] Thirteen instances of ‘speaking’ are recorded in the Torah [directed] to Moshe and Aharon, and thirteen exclusions corresponding to them, [in order] to teach you that they were not said to Aharon but to Moshe, for him to tell Aharon” [see Rashi 1:1]. Furthermore, he merited that this section was said to him @ITalone@it, and he did not share with Moshe, so that it would not seem that because of Moshe’s merit he heard the Divine command. Thus, it goes well even according to the Rabbis who disagree with Rabbi Yehudah, who is cited by Rashi above at the beginning of Vayikro. @d1Exalted@bo. See Kitzur Mizrachi as to why Rashi did not give this explanation on the phrase “@hh<HEB>בקרובי @hhאקדש@ee<ENG> (through those that are near Me I shall be sanctified)” since he brings the proof from the verse (Tehillim 68:36): “@hh<HEB>נורא אלקים ממקדשיך@ee<ENG> (“You are awesome, O God, from Your Sanctuaries).”<QC>
@p1[4]@p2<TIE>Uziel was the brother of Amram@bo. [Rashi mentions this so that you would not erroneously] explain that @hh<HEB>דוד@ee<ENG> is referring to the husband of his aunt, as in Parshas Acharei Mos (18:14), where we find that @hh<HEB>דודתך@ee<ENG> is referring to the wife of your uncle. Alternatively, this is so that we will not err by saying that “Aharon’s uncle” refers to Mishael and Elzafan. Therefore, Rashi explains: Uziel was the brother of Amram. @d1So as not to disturb@bo. Otherwise, it should say: Come closer and carry your brothers and bury them. Why does it say, “from the presence of the Sanctuary”? Rather: “Take away .<TIE>.<TIE>. [so as not to disturb].” Rashi is answering the question: Why did Moshe not call Elozor and Isomor? It is explicit in Scripture (21:2): “for his brother” he may become impure. To this, Rashi answers that this taking out was not for the sake of burial. Rather: “from the presence of the Sanctuary” — “As a man who says<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Therefore, Elozor and Isomor were not permitted to become impure. And this is even though in fact Elozor and Isomor did not become impure even for the sake of burial from the strength of a Divine command (v. 7): “From the entrance of the Tent of Meeting you shall not go forth” (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it).<QC>
@p1[5]@p2<TIE>Of the dead men@bo. As it is written, “@hh<HEB>בכתנתם@ee<ENG> (in their tunics),” and every @hh<HEB>כתונת@ee<ENG> mentioned in Torah Kohanim (Vayikro) is referring to garments of kehunah. Mishael and Elzafan, however, were Levites and not kohanim; so from where would they have tunics? Rather, it must refer to [the tunics of] the dead men. @p1[6]@p2<TIE>Do not let [your hair] grow@bo. Meaning: the hair of his head. I.e., someone whose hair grows long, the hairs become divided one from the other and become disheveled (@hh<HEB>פרע@ee<ENG>). [You might ask:] Rashi explains later in Parshas Sotah (Bamidbar 5:18): “And [the @ITkohein@it shall] expose (@hh<HEB>ופרע@ee<ENG>) the [hair on the] head of the woman” — “He unravels the braids of her hair<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” and yet here he explains that @hh<HEB>פרע@ee<ENG> means growing [the hair long]! The answer is: The unraveling of her hair braids is the ‘growth’ of her hair in terms of appearance, because until now it was braided and it seemed she had no hair, but with the unraveling of her hair it seems as if her hair grew. @d1From here [we learn] that a mourner@bo. Re’m writes: In Moed Katan (14b) Rashi explains that the fact the verse needs to permit the sons of Aharon implies that others are prohibited [to take a haircut], because Rashi holds the view that the verse, “Do not let [your hair] grow long” comes to @ITpermit@it Aharon’s sons [to take a haircut], and for that reason they inferred: This implies that every other mourner is prohibited. For if the verse comes to @ITcaution@it them — that they are not permitted to let their hair grow long, how could they infer from here that others are prohibited to take a haircut and are obligated to let their hair grow? In truth, the only inference that could be made is since Aharon’s sons are prohibited from letting their hair grow, this implies that other mourners are permitted to let their hair grow. However, this poses a difficulty: If the verse comes to permit Aharon’s sons [to take a haircut], but they are not obligated to let their hair grow, why does Scripture write, “So that you will not die” afterwards? This implies that if they let their hair grow they will die, as Rashi himself explains: Therefore, if you do so, you will die. If so, Rashi’s words seem to be contradictory. This matter needs analysis. See there where Re’m dwells at length on this matter. Perhaps [we can say:] Rashi sensed this difficulty and therefore explained in his commentary on Chumash: “From here [we learn] that a mourner is forbidden [to take] a haircut<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @d1Therefore, if<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. @boRe’m explains: Rashi explains this here, although it is obvious you can infer the positive statement from the negative statement, and so we infer throughout the entire Torah. [Here, however, it is] to teach that the verse’s intention is the affirmative statement that is inferred from it, and not the prohibition itself. This is because even in the rest of the optional matters that do not have the death penalty it is applicable to say with regard to them that if he will not do them he will not die. In this way we can explain “and you will not die” of (v. 9), “[do not drink] wine or any other intoxicant.” Rashi relies on his explanation here and does not explain similarly over there. It is from the superfluous phrases “you shall not die” that Rashi derives this, [because it did not need to be said] since Aharon’s sons were permitted to take a haircut, perforce they will not die. It seems that Rashi infers that this verse implies that other mourners are forbidden [to cut their hair], for if everyone else was permitted, and the verse only comes to caution that Aharon’s sons should not let their hair grow, if so, it would be difficult: Why does the verse need to caution them, since everyone else is permitted, why would you think that they would let their hair grow? Why should they be stringent and disturb the Omnipresent’s celebration? Furthermore: Why does it need to say, “and you will not die” — “therefore, if you do so, you will die”? Why do I need so much — a warning after a warning? It is understandable if all other mourners are prohibited [to cut their hair], for this reason we need a warning after a warning, so that you will not say that although Aharon’s sons were permitted to cut their hair, nevertheless, they could be stringent with themselves and go beyond the letter of the law since other mourners are prohibited [from taking a haircut]. For this reason Scripture needs to caution them, and write, “and you will not die” — “therefore, if you do so, you will die.” With this it seems to me that all Re’m’s difficulties are resolved. @d1Must [be mourned] by all. @boI.e., everyone is obligated to mourn if a Torah scholar is in pain, as the example here, in which Aharon was in pain. We should not say, however, perhaps this implies that if a Torah scholar died he must be mourned by all, as it is written: “And the entire House of Israel shall weep<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” For if so, Scripture should have written, “and @ITtheir@it brothers,” i.e., the brothers of the dead ones, which refer to all of Israel, “shall weep over the conflagration.” However, since it is written: “And @ITyour@it brothers,” it implies the brothers of Aharon, Elozor, and Isomor — the ones to whom Moshe was speaking.<QC>
@p1[9]@p2<TIE>In a manner which intoxicates@bo. Meaning: If he took a break [in drinking] or he mixed it with the smallest measure of water he is exempt. [You might ask:] Rashi writes, without any qualifications, that one who enters the Tent of Meeting [while he is intoxicated] is liable the death penalty. However, Toras Kohanim it implies that only if one was intoxicated @ITand@it performed Divine service is he liable death! The answer is: Since it is derived from a @ITgezeiroh shovoh@it, and regarding sanctification of the hands it is written in Parshas Ki Sisa explicitly (Shemos 30:20): “Or whenever they approach the Altar for Divine service,” which is only at the time of Divine service, therefore it was unnecessary for Rashi to specify here.<QC>
@p1[10]@p2<TIE>Between@bo. I.e., that there should be a distinction between proper service and [one which is] improper, for the services that are done in intoxication are always improper [and then there is no distinction between proper and improper]. This is what Rashi explains: “Thus you learn that if he performed [the Temple service his service is] invalid.” This is because it is written (v. 9): “When you enter the Tent of Meeting and you will not die,” and we derive through a @ITgezeiroh shovoh@it from sanctification of the hands and feet. There, it is specifically written when he performs Divine service, as I explained above. And perforce, if one performed Divine service while being intoxicated, he is liable the death penalty. If so, @ITall @itthe services that are performed while being intoxicated are improper, and if so, why does is it written, “to distinguish”? Rather, perforce we must say that it means, “in order that you should distinguish, etc.” Even though regarding [the next phrase], “To distinguish .<TIE>.<TIE>. between what is impure and what is pure,” this explanation is not applicable — that we would say: If you drink there will be no difference between the pure and the impure, and they will all be impure. Could it be that an intoxicated @ITkohein@it who performed the Divine service would make it impure? It is improper [but not impure]! Perforce, we must say: “To distinguish .<TIE>.<TIE>. between what is impure<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” [means:] You should know how to distinguish, and not that there should be a distinction, etc. Despite this, Rashi had to explain [the aforementioned] way regarding the Divine service. Accordingly, one time the explanation of the word @hh<HEB>ולהבדיל@ee<ENG> is: “in order that @ITyou should@it @ITdistinguish@it<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” in reference to [to the first phrase in the verse that teaches about the] Divine service, and another time: “in order that @ITyou know@it<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” in reference to impurity and purity. With this it seems we can answer the difficulty raised by Re’m: Concerning the phrase: “To distinguish .<TIE>.<TIE>. between what is impure and what is pure,” this explanation is not applicable! Re’m answered what he answered, see there at length.<QC>
@p1[11]@p2<TIE>Perhaps he is@bo. Meaning: And the @hh<HEB>ו@ee<ENG> of @hh<HEB>ולהבדיל@ee<ENG> and the @hh<HEB>ו@ee<ENG> of @hh<HEB>ולהורות@ee<ENG> are in addition to the first subject [prohibition of entering while intoxicated] and they too are liable the death penalty. @d1Kohanim in their service@bo. [Rashi knows this] because Scripture should have written only: “you and your sons.” In effect, when it is written, “with you,” it is as if it said “your sons will be with you.” But why do I need it? It is already written, “you and your sons.” Rather, it is to teach: “Kohanim in their service<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” This answers Re’m’s difficulty: From where does Rashi derive this? The verse, “you and your sons” is needed for itself, [to teach] that the sons are included in the warning as well. We cannot say that he derives it from the word “you,” and it comes to exclude, for if so, it would have to mean only “you” [Aharon, and not even his sons,] are worthy of death. Meaning: Since the verse put “and you will not die” is juxtaposed to “you and your sons,” which is a command that refers to their service, perforce: Kohanim in their service [are worthy of] death, but halachic decision making, which is a command to all of Israel is not [worthy of] death. According to the assumption that halachic decision making is worthy of death as well, it should say, “and you will not die” (v. 9) after, “[And that you may] teach” (v. 11), so that it would refer to the entire subject matter (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it).<QC>
@p1[12]@p2<TIE>For the sin of the Golden Calf@bo. You might ask: Above (v. 2), Rashi brings a Tannaic disagreement: One view holds because they rendered halachic decisions in the presence of their master, and the other holds because they entered the Sanctuary intoxicated with wine. The answer is: Both factors were the cause. If there had been only the deed of the Golden Calf, why did Hashem wait until now? Alternatively, why did He kill Nodov and Avihu, and not Elozor and Isomor? Rather, it must be [that the cause of death] can be attributed to another sin as well, each Tanna according to his reasoning. But if it was only for the last reason, I would say that there is no punishment without [a prior] warning, therefore the sin of the Golden Calf was necessary as well, since it had a warning. @d1And I also prayed@bo. [The word] “also” includes the [Aharon’s] children. @d1And holy things are forbidden to an @hb<HEB>אונן@BO<ENG> @bo(mourner on whom the obligation of burying the deceased still rests). Otherwise, why does it need to say this to them? It already speaks about it in Parshas Tzav (6:9): “Whatever remains from it shall be eaten by Aharon and his sons” (@ITRe’m@it). @d1Meal-offering of the eighth@bo. The twelve princes began to bring offerings and Nachshon was the first. [You might ask:] There was also the [meal-offering of the] he-goat of Rosh Chodesh, and so there were three he-goats! [The answer is:] Nevertheless, Rashi did not want to mention the he-goat of Rosh Chodesh since Moshe did not command him to eat that meal-offering, as it is implied at the end, when Aharon told Moshe: If you heard [this law] regarding holy offerings of a [specific] time, etc. (see Rashi, end of v. 19). Moshe agreed [with the rationale of] Aharon’s words. This implies that Moshe did not explicitly say to eat it in the first place.<QC>
@d1What does this verse teach? @boYou might ask: Above, as well, why did Rashi not explain: “Take the meal offering” — What does this verse teach? Because it is [a communal mealoffering,] etc.? Why did he need to explain: “Even though you are @hh<HEB>אוננים@ee<ENG> and holy things are forbidden to an @hh<HEB>אונן@ee<ENG>”? Another difficulty: Nearby (v. 13), Rashi explains: “For so have I been commanded” — “That they should eat it while they are @hh<HEB>אוננים@ee<ENG>.” Perhaps “for so have I been commanded” [means] they should eat the meal-offering as matzos? The answer is: “For so I have been commanded” implies a novel law — even though the law is otherwise regarding other meal-offerings. If it refers to [the law] that they should eat the meal-offering as matzos, this is obvious, for every meal-offering is eaten as matzos. Therefore, Rashi needs to explain: They should eat it while they are @hh<HEB>אוננים@ee<ENG>. Also, this is why he needs to explain above: “Take the meal-offering” — “Even though you are @hh<HEB>אוננים@ee<TIE><ENG>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” because the verse, “For so have I been commanded” refers back to it. However, if he was to explain above [on “Take the meal-offering”]: Because it is a communal meal-offering, it would no longer be applicable to write: “For so I have been commanded,” because with one command alone, in which He commands them regarding a meal-offering that this meal-offering will be treated like any other meal-offering, it would be sufficient. Why does it say again: “For so I have been commanded”? Rather, perforce, it was because of @hh<HEB>אנינות@ee<ENG> He commanded, which is contrary to the precedent that an @hh<HEB>אונן@ee<ENG> is prohibited to eat holy sacrifices.<QC>
@d1[14]@p2<TIE>Of the communal peace-offerings@bo. Re’m writes: I do not know why Rashi does not include here the breast of Nachshon’s peaceofferings that was brought on that day, as he included Nachshon’s meal offering with the communal meal-offering of the eighth day, etc. (see Rashi v. 12). [The answer is:] Regarding the meal-offering, concerning which the verse comes to permit [to be eaten although they are] @hh<HEB>אוננים@ee<ENG>, Rashi found it necessary to include Nachshon’s meal-offering, so that you would not say that the verse only means to permit a communal meal-offering about which it revealed the law explicitly; Nachshon’s meal-offering, however, which was not revealed in the verse, was not permitted and is prohibited to be eaten by @hh<HEB>אוננים@ee<ENG>. [Therefore, Rashi lets us know otherwise in v. 12]. However, concerning the breast of the wave-offering, about which we have not been taught any novel law that is not included in other peace-offerings, why would Rashi need to include Nachshon’s peace-offerings, for what difference would there be between Nachshon’s peace offerings and these peace-offerings? (@ITGur Aryeh@it). @d1Within the camp of Israel@bo. Meaning: Even though those impure from contact with the dead and the other types of impure persons are found there. Rashi’s proof is from the fact Scripture did not write: “In a sacred place,” perforce it means a place that is partially pure. And since it says above regarding the meal-offering (v. 13): “You shall eat @ITit@it in a sacred place,” [this implies:] It, and not another. [Thus, the place of eating the breast] is removed from the place of the Shechinoh and established to be in the camp of the Levites. Furthermore, since it is written afterwards: “In a pure place,” this implies a further leniency, and it may be eaten in the Israelite’s camp, for it is obvious that they may not eat it in an impure place.<QC>
@p1[16]@p2<TIE>Additional sacrifices for Rosh Chodesh@bo. This is the goat of additional offerings of Rosh Chodesh that is offered as a communal sinoffering, as it is written (v. 17): “And He gave it to you, to bear the iniquity of the congregation.” Which goat bears the sin of the congregation? This is the goat of Rosh Chodesh. @d1Why was. @boThe following is Re’m’s text: “Why was this one burnt and why were these @ITnot@it eaten?” I.e., they did not eat it [the goat of the additional sacrifices for Rosh Chodesh] during the day because of @hh<HEB>אנינות@ee<ENG> but rather left it to be eaten towards evening, when the time of @hh<HEB>אנינות@ee<ENG> would be finished, according to the view of Rabbi Yuda and Rabbi Shimon (Zevachim 101a) who said that the prohibition of @hh<HEB>אנינות@ee<ENG> is permitted at night. It was burnt and not eaten because it was touched by something impure [and so it could not be rectified, thus, it was immediately burnt]. But, according to Rabbi Nechemiah [ibid.] the reason was because it was of the sacrifices [ordained] for the generations [which were not permitted to @hh<HEB>אוננים@ee<ENG>] and @hh<HEB>אוננים@ee<ENG> are prohibited to eat from offerings both during the day and the night by Torah law. Thus, they burnt it immediately (@ITRe’m@it). However, if we have the text: “And why were these eaten?” it is then entirely one inquiry: Why was this one [the goat of the additional sacrifices for Rosh Chodesh] burnt and this one [the he-goat of the installation or the goat offered by Nachshon] eaten? Either both of them should have been burnt or both of them eaten! This, however, is one inquiry, [yet Rashi writes there were two inquires], therefore, we should use the text: “And why were these @ITnot@it eaten?” Gur Aryeh uses the text: “Why were these eaten?” He explains, however, that there are two inquires: “Why was this one burnt? If it was because of @hh<HEB>אנינות@ee<ENG> — is it not true that @hh<HEB>אנינות@ee<ENG> is permitted to you! According to your response that you were not allowed to eat them because of @hh<HEB>אנינות@ee<ENG>, why, then, did you eat the other sin-offerings?” This is considered two inquires — the first is according to the truth and the second is according to their response. @d1He turned.@bo Otherwise, why was he angry at them? Aharon was included in the anger as well, and he was required to respond (v. 19): “and then such [tragedy] befell me!” This is how it appears in Toras Kohanim — that he was angry with Aharon as well. @d1Answer. @boRashi was forced to explain this way, because wherever it says “@hh<HEB>לאמר@ee<ENG>” in the Torah [it means] to tell others. Alternatively, “@hh<HEB>וידבר@ee<ENG>” is a general rule, and “@hh<HEB>לאמר@ee<ENG>” is a detail (@hh<HEB>כלל ופרט@ee<ENG>). Here, however, these explanations are not applicable, and therefore Rashi has to explain: “Answer my questions!” @p1[17]@p2<TIE>Did [they then eat it] outside? @boMeaning: You would assume the question “why” refers to the phrase “in the sacred place,” as if Moshe asked: Why did you not eat it in the sacred place?” For this reason, Rashi is answering the question: Did they then eat it outside the sacred place? Rashi answers: The word “why” refers to “did you not eat it,” and the meaning of “in the sacred place” is: @ITSince@it it was in the sacred place, and did not go out [from its permitted boundaries] to become invalid. However, it would be impossible to make this statement if Moshe did not ask them first whether it went out [from its boundaries] and they answered him that it did not. Therefore, Rashi inserts: “Perhaps it went out ‘beyond the curtains’ and became invalid?” The statement, “for it is holy of holies” is the reason for the statement, “Perhaps it went out beyond the curtains<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (@ITRe’m@it). @d1Did not [come] for atonement. @boYou might ask: In the beginning of the parshah it is written (9:7): “and atone on your behalf,” which refers to the sin-offering of the eighth day. Perforce, these also came for [the purpose of] atonement. The answer is: When it is written “and atone on your behalf” it does not really mean atonement, but rather it is only an expression of cleansing and preparation. Similarly, we find regarding the person with tzora’as, where it is written (14:19): “and atone (@hh<HEB>וכפר@ee<ENG>) for the person undergoing purification from his impurity.” What was his sin for which he needs atonement? Rather, it must be that there as well it is an expression of becoming fit. @p1[18]@p2<TIE>You should have. @boIt does not mean they should eat it now, as the expression implies, since it was already burnt.<QC>
@d1Regarding the meal-offering. @boThis is because it [the goat of Rosh Chodesh] is holy of holies and should be eaten in the sacred place like it [the meal-offering]. However, we should not say that “as I have commanded you” refers to the breast that is the wave-offering and the thigh that is the separated portion, regarding which Moshe instructed them to eat as well (v. 14). This is because they are sacrifices of lesser sanctity, and they are eaten in a pure place, thus, we cannot derive [laws pertaining to] sacrifices that are holy of holies [which must be eaten in the sacred place] from those of lesser sanctity. It appears to me that the answer is: [Moshe could not be referring to the breast and the thigh] because Hashem did not command explicitly regarding eating the breast and the thigh, but rather only regarding the meal-offering, as Scripture states (v. 12): “Take the meal-offering .<TIE>.<TIE>. and eat it [as] matzos.” Moshe, however, added them by his own reasoning by comparing the eating of the breast and thigh to the eating of the meal-offering (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it). @p1[19]@p2<TIE>The term “speaking” is an expression of harshness@bo. Meaning: [This is true] where it is not written afterwards @hh<HEB>לאמר@ee<ENG>, as I explained in Parshas Va’eira (6:2). Alternatively, when the speech comes in a private conversation, such as (Bamidbar 21:5): “The people spoke (@hh<HEB>וידבר@ee<ENG>) against Hashem and against Moshe, ‘Why have you brought us up<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.’” in which it should say @hh<HEB>ויאמר@ee<ENG> since it is a private conversation. Here, too, it should say @hh<HEB>ויאמר אהרן וגו'@ee<ENG>, since it is a private conversation (@ITRe’m@it). And this is what I wrote in Parshas Va’eira. @d1Rather@bo. Meaning: Why does it need to say: “Behold, today they brought<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”? It would have been sufficient to say: “Such [tragedy] befell me, if I had eaten<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Rather, this is what it means to say: Moshe said to them [Elozor and Isomor]: Perhaps you sprinkled its blood as @hh<HEB>אוננים@ee<ENG> after the death of your brothers, and an @hh<HEB>אונן@ee<ENG> who performs the service profanes it? Therefore, you did not eat it. Moshe did not see their actions because he was heavily involved with the Shechinoh on that day And he was afraid they found the blood of this he-goat that had not yet been sprinkled and they sprinkled it. Aharon answered him: “And did they, who are ordinary kohanim, bring [it], so that you would think it is invalid? I brought [it], for it is incumbent upon me, as it is written (9:7): “Approach the altar,” and a @ITkohein godol@it may bring [a sacrifice while being] an @hh<HEB>אונן@ee<ENG>. Accordingly, the @hh<HEB>ן@ee<ENG> of @hh<HEB>הן היום@ee<ENG> is in place of a @hh<HEB>ם@ee<ENG>, [meaning: Did @ITthey@it bring today?], as in (Rus 1:13): “@hh<HEB>הלהן תשברנה@ee<ENG> (Would you wait for them?).” Re’m explained this at length, but I was brief. Re’m writes: “[You might ask:] Bringing a sacrifice is more lenient than eating it, for a @ITkohein godol@it may bring a sacrifice while he is an @hh<HEB>אונן@ee<ENG> but he may not eat from it, and here they were permitted even to eat from it while they were @hh<HEB>אוננים@ee<ENG>, so much more so they [would be permitted to] bring the sacrifice. [The answer is:] Nevertheless, Moshe said to them: “Perhaps you erred and thought<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” This raises a difficulty, though, for according to Re’m’s words — that the bringing of the sacrifice is more lenient and it is permitted [to an @hh<HEB>אונן@ee<ENG>] — if so, why did Aharon reply: “And did they bring it<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” which implies that it would be invalid if they indeed brought it, from the perspective of bringing it. [On the contrary,] Aharon should have answered better: “Would it be invalid today? It is permitted! Rather, the reason it was burnt was because such [tragedy] befell me, and there was no one to eat it, since there is a difference in the law between the sacrifices earmarked for a [specific] time and the sacrifices prescribed for generations.” Therefore, it appears to me that it should be interpreted according to its plain meaning: An @hh<HEB>אונן@ee<ENG> who performs Divine service actually profanes it, and Aharon ruled as the law is for [future] generations. The @ITkal vachomer@it, indeed, can be refuted, because the leniency for eating the sacrifices of an @hh<HEB>אונן@ee<ENG> is different here, in that it was only so the sacrifices would not become @hh<HEB>נותר@ee<ENG> (left-over), for there were no other kohanim in the world, only these, and they were @hh<HEB>אוננים@ee<ENG>. This is not so regarding the bringing of the sacrifice, however, since the @ITkohein godol@it was permitted to bring it. Thus, it remained prohibited [for an ordinary @ITkohein@it to bring it]. It would be impossible, however, for the @ITkohein godol@it to eat the entire amount, and ultimately it would become @hh<HEB>נותר@ee<ENG>. This is the reason for the law of [future] generations as well: A @ITkohein godol@it may bring sacrifices while he is an @hh<HEB>אונן@ee<ENG> since there are many Divine services that only he is allowed to perform. However, [regarding to eating from the sacrifices] all kohanim are allowed to eat from the sacrifices, therefore, the @ITkohein godol@it may not eat. [The point is that] it is not because the prohibition of eating the sacrifice is more stringent than the prohibition of bringing it, and therefore there is no @ITkal vachomer@it (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it). Gur Aryeh explains that Divine service is more stringent than eating [sacrifices], because we find that a @ITkohein@it with a blemish may eat sacrifices, but he is invalid to perform Divine service. If so, we cannot use the [following] @ITkal vachomer@it: Eating [sacrifices] is more stringent because it is prohibited to a @ITkohein godol@it when he is an @hh<HEB>אונן@ee<ENG>, yet it was permitted to the sons of Aharon while they were @hh<HEB>אוננים@ee<ENG>, then the Divine service, which is more lenient, in that it is permitted to the @ITkohein godol@it when he is an @hh<HEB>אונן@ee<ENG>, is it not logical that it should be permitted to the sons of Aharon who are @hh<HEB>אוננים@ee<ENG>! [This @ITkal vachomer@it can be refuted] because we can object: Eating has a leniency that it is permitted to a @ITkohein@it with a blemish [whereas such a @ITkohein@it is invalid to perform Divine service]. @d1And if I had eaten@bo. Meaning: [Rashi adds @ITif @itbecause the expression] @hh<HEB>ואכלתי@ee<ENG> implies he had already eaten it, but this was not so, for it had been burnt (@ITKitzur Mizrachi@it). @d1Permitted, for [the laws applying to] an @HB<HEB>אונן@ee@BO<ENG> [relate] only<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. @boYou might ask: This answer is only according to the view that it was burnt because it had touched something impure; for if it was because of @hh<HEB>אנינות@ee<ENG> (the state of being an @hh<HEB>אונן@ee<ENG>), so much more so it would pose a difficulty: Why did they burn it, they should have waited until the night [to eat it], as Ramban writes. If so, what difference does it make that he answered him that it was prohibited due to the @hh<HEB>אנינות@ee<ENG> of the day, but not at night, considering that it was burnt because it touched something impure. What kind of answer was this? We can give a forced answer: Moshe was not asking that perhaps it touched something impure, because according to his reasoning they should have eaten it right away. If so, they certainly could have prevented it from touching impurity in the short amount of time from sprinkling the blood until eating. Probably, they would have eaten it right away, as those with alacrity perform mitzvos as soon as possible. Thus, Aharon answered: “Today” — i.e., there is a prohibition for @hh<HEB>אנינות@ee<ENG> in the day, and they were forced to leave it [i.e., not to eat it] until the evening. This made created the possibility for it to have been touched by impurity and therefore it was burnt. @p1[20]@p2<TIE>He admitted and was not ashamed<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo [Rather Moshe said: I heard and I forgot (Zevachim 101a)]. This raises a difficulty: Where does the verse hint that he admitted by saying: “I heard [and I forgot],” perhaps he admitted by saying: “I never heard”? The answer is: The phrase, “Moshe heard” is superfluous, for it is obvious he heard, as he spoke with Aharon. Rather, this is what it means: Since Moshe had already heard previously, Aharon’s words were good in his eyes afterwards, for he had forgotten what he had heard (@ITDivrei Dovid@it). Rashi’s words raise a difficulty, however, because it should not say “@hh<HEB>וישמע@ee<ENG>,” but rather: “.<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>@hh<HEB>ומשה שמע@hh@ee<ENG>’,” which is in the past tense. Then, it would mean that because he had already heard it was therefore good in his eyes. Another difficulty: Rashi should have made his comment on the s.v. @hh<HEB>וישמע@ee<ENG> and not on “It was good in his eyes.” Therefore, it appears that the verse’s language is surely reversed, and the word “@hh<HEB>וישמע@ee<ENG>” is superfluous as well. It should say only: “And it was good in Moshe’s eyes.” Although the word @hh<HEB>וישמע@ee<ENG> hints at hearing, as implied by Targum Yonasan (see there), nevertheless, we should derive from the fact that it should say: “He heard and it was good in Moshe’s eyes.” However, [according to the way it is] now, “it was good in his eyes” does not refer to Moshe alone, but rather comes to hint that we should also explain: “It was good in his eyes,” i.e., in @ITAharon’s@it eyes. [This follows the saying]: Hashem spoke once and we heard twice. Thus, since @hh<HEB>וישמע@ee<ENG> comes to teach regarding ‘hearing,’ it must be that Moshe admitted he had heard and forgot, and therefore, “it was good in his eyes,” i.e., also in Aharon’s eyes, for he was happy that his understanding [of the matter] was in agreement with the Omnipresent’s point of view (@ITRav Yaakov Trivash@it). Some raise the difficulty: It implies here that it is a greater shame if he would say “I forgot” than if he said “I never heard,” and yet in Shabbos (119b-120a): “Rabbi Katina said: Even at the time of Yerusholayim’s shame there were still honest men there, as it is written (Yeshayahu 3:7): ‘[I will not be a ruler,] while in my house there is neither bread nor clothing,’ which refers to Torah, and they would not say: I learned and I forgot.” [Thus, they were honest because they would admit to being completely unlearned although they could have said: I learned and forgot]. This poses a difficulty: Perhaps [they were not honest at all but] they just did not want to say “I learned and I forgot” because it is a great shame. [Otherwise, they might have lied]. However, there is no difficulty at all. There, it is referring to the entirety of Torah — that he does not know anything about it — in such a case it is a great disgrace if he says he never learned any Torah. It would be better for him to say: I did what is incumbent upon me and I learned, but I forgot for some reason. However, this is not so here where it refers to one matter. It would have been more comfortable for Moshe to say I learned much Torah, but one matter I have not learned yet. Furthermore, we can say: How could Moshe say: “I never heard”? If so, from where would Aharon know? For if Moshe never heard, [from where would Aharon know? Rather,] the praise of Moshe’s admission was in this: Regarding anything that has two types of rationale, one to permit and one to forbid, people will often rationalize one way and then later retract from their original line of reasoning, because the second line of reasoning seems more logical. Thus, there is no shame in retracting. Therefore, if Moshe would have said: I never heard, but my reasoning was originally to permit, but Aharon posed a difficulty on it. And since there was an opposite reasoning [not to permit], it would not be shameful for Moshe [to retract from his original position]. However, now that he [originally] heard it was forbidden, and he forgot and ruled to permit from the strength of his reasoning, and then he remembered that he heard explicitly to forbid, this clarifies now that his reasoning was wrong. In this, there is great shame. If so, the Gemara in Shabbos (ibid.) presents no difficulty, for there it is not applicable to say they relied on rationale that would result in shame (@ITDivrei Dovid@it). @p1[1]@p2<TIE>To tell Aharon@bo. Thirteen instances of “speaking” are recorded in the Torah [directed] to Moshe and Aharon, and thirteen exclusions corresponding to them, [in order] to teach you that Hashem did not speak to Aharon but to Moshe alone, as mentioned above in Parshas Vayikro. Although Rashi already explains above in Parshas Vayikro (1:1), he explains here again so that you will not explain that as a reward for “Aharon was silent” Aharon merited that the Divine word was specially [directed] to him alone, together with Moshe, as he merited regarding the laws of those intoxicated by wine. Furthermore, we can explain that although in general the Divine word was spoken simultaneously by the two of them — that was when they spoke to Israel. Here, however, Moshe told Aharon that he alone would be the messenger to tell them (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it). @p1[2]@p2<TIE>An expression of life@bo. Otherwise, it should say: “These are living things (@hh<HEB>חיה@ee<ENG> instead of @hh<HEB>החיה@ee<ENG>) that you may eat from among all the animals.” @d1Hold@bo. Meaning: [Rashi adds this explanation] because the word @hh<HEB>זאת@ee<ENG> [implies] one points with his finger to the subject about which he is hinting, but when Hashem was speaking to him there was nothing impure there. Re’m wrote at length [but] I made it brief. @d1This teaches@bo. [Rashi knows this] because it should only say: @hh<HEB>זאת@ee<ENG> (these are), why does it say @hh<HEB>החיה@ee<ENG>? [You might ask:] Rashi [already] derived from the word @hh<HEB>החיה@ee<ENG> — “an expression of life”! The answer is: He derives that from the extra @hh<HEB>ה@ee<ENG> in the word @hh<HEB>החיה@ee<ENG>. However, [the extra word itself] comes to teach [that animals<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.] @p1[3]@p2<TIE>“Split.” @boI.e., this is not translated as “hoof,” but rather as “split.” And the word @hh<HEB>פרסה@ee<ENG> means @ITplante@it in Old French, or @ITkaput@it (hoof) in German. The Targum’s proof is that it is written (v. 5): “The rabbit, for it chews its cud but does not have a cloven hoof (@hh<HEB>ופרסה לא @hhיפריס@ee<ENG>),” but in fact, all ruminants have hooves with which they walk upon the earth. Perforce, @hh<HEB>מפרסת@ee<ENG> is translated as “split.” @d1Extraneous@bo. [Rashi knows this] because it is already written (v. 2): “that you may eat from among all the animals.” Rather, [it must be that] this is an [apparently] extraneous word<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. It is as if it is written, “You may eat the animal that is inside an animal,” which refers to the embryo found within an animal, for the phrase “that you shall eat from among all the animals” refers to the entire section. @d1A positive commandment.@bo [It is a positive commandment] because a negative command that is derived from a positive command is considered a positive commandment. The negative commandment is written clearly nearby (v. 4): “However, these in particular you may not eat<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” However, it does not come to teach the plain meaning — that it is permitted to eat — for it already says (v. 2): “That you may eat from among all the animals.” @p1[8]@p2<TIE>Kal vachomer@bo. You might ask: We may not derive a warning [for punishment] based on a @ITkal vachomer@it! The answer is: It is different here where there is a positive command (v. 3): “You may eat @ITit@it,” upon which Rashi explains: “And not an impure animal.” This refers to every impure animal, since it is written, “you may eat it,” which implies that the ones written in the parshah are permitted to be eaten, but the rest of the animals that do not have signs are forbidden to be eaten although they are not written in the parshah. If so, since there is a positive command also for the animal that has no permitting sign, we may derive a warning based on a @ITkal vachomer@it so that there will be a negative command as well. However, where there is no positive command we may not derive the warning from a @ITkal vachomer@it (@ITRe’m@it). [Alternatively:] Perhaps we do not derive a warning from a @ITkal vachomer@it where we wish to derive from the essence of the law. [For example,] the Torah prohibited [relations with] one’s granddaughter and we wish to derive [the prohibition also applies to] one’s daughter from this. In such a case we say that we may not derive a warning [based on a @ITkal vachomer@it], for perhaps it is a Scriptural decree and thus we cannot derive the warning based on a @ITkal vachomer@it. However, when the Torah gives a reason [for prohibiting] and states: “The rabbit, for it chews its cud but does not have a cloven hoof,” then certainly we may clearly derive that if an animal has no sign at all there is more reason to forbid it, and it may be derived correctly through a @ITkal vachomer@it. When [the Torah gives] a reason it is not applicable [to say] “we do not derive a warning<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (@ITGur Aryeh@it).<QC>
@d1On a festival@bo. “On a festival” means on Yom Tov, i.e., when the people of Israel are obligated to purify themselves on the festival, because one is obligated to bring the burnt-offering of being seen, to the Temple courtyard. This [reason] is not applicable during the rest of the year. @p1[11]@p2<TIE>To forbid their mixtures@bo. [Rashi knows this] because this is an extra verse, for it is written above: “They are repulsive.” [Enough to] impart [their] taste. @boThis is only when one kind is mixed with a different kind, but if one kind was mixed with its own kind, one impure mixed with two hundred pure is permitted. @d1Gnats. @boMeaning: A [creeping] thing that originates and develops in the water inside of vessels is not subject to the prohibition. The verse: “And their carcasses shall be repulsive to you” comes to include [in the prohibition] immediately when [the creeping things] are separated from the water, for instance, he filtered them from the water. They are forbidden because they have been separated from the place of their proliferation. @p1[12]@p2<TIE>What does this verse tell [us]? @boThis is an extra verse, for it is written above (v. 10): “All that do not have fins<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @d1I might know only<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. @boI.e., were this verse not written, I would have thought: “I know only<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @d1Although it lost them in being brought up@bo. However, this cannot be derived from the first verse (10), for if so, it should say “in the water,” and not “in the oceans and rivers.” Rather, it teaches that in the oceans and rivers, which are running, flowing water, the fish without signs are forbidden, but in vessels, ditches, and cisterns, even though they have no signs they may be eaten. See there (Chulin 67a). @p1[13]@p2<TIE>“To be eaten.” @bo[Rashi knows this] from the fact Moshe Rabbeinu changed the expression in Mishneh Torah (Devarim 14:12) and wrote: @hh<HEB>לא תאכלו@ee<ENG>, and did not write @hh<HEB>לא יאכלו@ee<ENG>, which implies both the prohibition of eating and obtaining benefit, as he heard the Divine word from Hashem. Rather, it must be that this was how he received it at Sinai: [The phrase] @hh<HEB>לא יאכלו@ee<ENG> written regarding impure birds does not come to prohibit one to receive any benefit from them. Perforce, then, it [comes to make] liable one who feeds them to a minor. @d1All of them are of one species@bo. You might ask: How does this relate to what Rashi explains beforehand? The answer is: Since he explains beforehand that the impure birds written in the Torah explicitly are permitted for one to receive benefit, for it is written: @hh<HEB>לא תאכלם@ee<ENG>, we can explain where it is written, @hh<HEB>למינה למינו למינהו@ee<ENG>, even if they do not resemble each other, either in appearance or name, they are of one species. However, if those that were written in the Torah explicitly were forbidden for one to receive benefit, because it is written: @hh<HEB>לא יאכל@ee<ENG>, we would then explain that where it is written @hh<HEB>למינה למינו למינהו@ee<ENG> it does not teach they are actually one species, but rather those that resemble each other in appearance and name are prohibited [also for one to receive benefit] as these which are written explicitly. However, those that do not resemble them, either in appearance or name, are not the same species, and are not as stringent as the ones written explicitly in the Torah in that they are not forbidden for one to receive benefit; they are only prohibited to be eaten. But now that we say even those that are written in the Torah explicitly do not have a prohibition for one to receive benefit, if so, we cannot say those that are written explicitly are more stringent. Perforce, it comes to teach that they are of one species.<QC>
@p1[23]@p2<TIE>It has five [feet], it is [ritually] clean@bo. Otherwise, why does it say this when above it is written (v. 21-22): “However, these you may eat of all the flying insects that walk on four [legs]<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” which implies that only these four species [mentioned] are permitted, but the rest of the flying insects that have four feet are prohibited to be eaten? Rather, it must be: “[This] comes and teaches [us].<TIE>.<TIE>.” This raises a difficulty: Perhaps [we should instead learn] from this that if it has two legs it is pure? [The answer is:] It seems that a verse is surely not needed for one with two legs, for Scripture only says: “that walk on four [legs]” and not on two. A verse is needed, however, for five legs, because four legs are included in five. Therefore, it is needed to exclude that if it has five it is pure (@ITGur Aryeh@it). @p1[24]@p2<TIE>There is uncleanness with their touch@bo. I.e., not that He commands them to become impure. Rather, this is what it means: If you touch them you will be made unclean. @p1[25]@p2<TIE>The uncleanness [caused by] carrying is more severe than [that caused by] touch. @boRe’m writes: I have not heard a correct explanation as to what Rashi is coming to let us know with this rule. It is explicitly written here that the impurity caused by touch does not require washing of clothing and impurity caused by carrying requires washing of clothing! If it is to inform us that everywhere else it is as it is written here — what practical difference does that make? Perhaps the answer is: Rashi is coming to let us know that the impurity of touch is not derived through a @ITkal vachomer@it from the impurity of carrying and it would thus require washing of clothing, [as follows:] [The impurity acquired by] carrying is @ITnot@it applicable to creeping creatures [and the impurity of a seminal discharge], yet it requires washing of clothing, then [the impurity of] touch, which @ITis@it applicable to all types of impurities, is it not logical that it requires washing of clothing? For this reason Rashi explains: “Wherever the uncleanness [caused by] carrying is mentioned, it is more severe than [that caused by] touch,” and you will not find any place where Scripture obligates washing clothing for the impurity of touch. If the impurity of touch required washing of clothes from a @ITkal vachomer@it, then Scripture would not have neglected to write in some place regarding the impurity of touch: “He shall wash his garments.” The same type of argument is found in the first chapter of Chulin (22b) (@ITRe’m@it). This does not seem to be true, because if Rashi means this, he should say the opposite: “Wherever the uncleanness [caused by] touch is mentioned, it does not require washing of clothing.” And a further difficulty: Rashi should explain that Scripture is coming to let us know that the impurity of carrying is not derived from the impurity of touch to be exempt from washing clothing, [as the Sages derived in Toras Kohanim]: [The impurity of] touch is more allencompassing, yet it does not cause impurity to clothing, then [the impurity of] carrying, which encompasses less [types of impurities], is it not logical that it should not cause impurity [to clothing]? Therefore, the Torah teaches, etc. It seems to me that Rashi is coming to inform us not to say [the impurities of] touch and carrying are the same. Because if so, when the Torah writes that creeping creatures and seminal discharge cause impurity through touch, they should also cause impurity by carrying. With regard to this Rashi says in any case the impurity [caused by] carrying is more severe than [that caused by] touch, in that it requires washing of clothing. If Scripture’s intent was that they [creeping creatures and seminal discharge] cause impurity also with carrying, it would not have remained silent, for washing of clothing cannot be derived from [the impurity of] touch, since, “it is sufficient for that which is derived through logical means [such as through comparison or @ITkal@it @ITvachomer@it, to be like that from which is was derived].<TIE>.<TIE>.” (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it). @p1[26]@p2<TIE>At the end of the parshah it explains [the rule] regarding a [ritually] clean animal. @boI.e., Scripture divides them into two categories to tell us that the [proper] slaughter of a treifah (debilitated animal) renders it pure from the impurity of neveilah (carcass, an animal that died without slaughter). For this reason it is written there (v. 39): “If [any animal] dies<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” [which implies] specifically one that dies [without slaughter] causes the impurity of neveilah, but a treifah, although it will eventually die, if it was slaughtered it is pure from the impurity of neveilah. However, an impure animal, whether it died or was slaughtered, is not purified from the impurity of neveilah by means of slaughtering. Therefore, it is written regarding it (v. 27): “[All who touch] their carcasses,” without specifying whether it died or was slaughtered (@ITRe’m@it). @p1[27]@p2<TIE>Bear and cat@bo. Meaning: Their paws are not covered with hooves.<QC>
@p1[32]@p2<TIE>After its immersion it is unclean@bo. I.e., you should not say that because it was put into water, that is, it was immersed, it would be impure until evening, as would be understood from, “shall be brought into water and is unclean until the evening.” Therefore, Rashi adds “even after its immersion” — it does not depart from its impurity until after the setting of the sun. Meaning: For terumah, whereas for ma’aser (tithes) it is pure immediately after it is immersed and comes out, as it says in Yevamos (75a) (@ITKitzur Mizrachi@it). @p1[33]@p2<TIE>Except through its interior@bo. I.e., if the impurity entered its interior space but did not touch it, it is impure. From the outside, however, it remains pure even if the impurity touches it. This is derived from, “everything that is within it becomes unclean,” [by means of a comparison:] We find that the interior — when the vessel causes impurity to the @ITfood@it within — even if the impurity never touches [all the food contents] it becomes impure, for even if the vessel was full of mustard seeds, everything is impure, although the vessel does not [directly] touch all the seeds, but only the seeds that are adjacent to its walls. You cannot say that this seed causes impurity to that one, and this one causes impurity to that one, since food cannot cause impurity to food. Furthermore, if it did, this would become a Second [level of impurity], and the next one a Third, but a Third does not cause impurity to make a Fourth. Perforce, the mustard seeds become impure by being in the interior of the vessel. So too, the interior mentioned in the imparting of impurity to the vessel — even though the impurity never touches the vessel, but it is only suspended within [the interior of] the vessel, the vessel becomes impure (@ITRe’m@it). @d1In turn causes impurity@bo. [Rashi knows this] from the fact that it is not written “everything that it touches within it.” Rather, even if it does not touch anything but only enters the interior, whatever is in it is impure (@ITMinchas Yehudah@it). Alternatively, it is not as if the vessel is full of impurity and whatever is in it is touching the impurity, for if so, why are vessels excluded from the law of becoming impure from the interior of an earthenware vessel, as Rashi explains later (v. 34)? Rather, it must be that the vessel itself becomes impure from the creeping creature in its interior, and the vessel becomes a First [source of impurity]. It then in turn causes impurity to whatever is in its interior to make it a Second. Thus, vessels are excluded, because a vessel that is a First does not cause impurity to another vessel (@ITRe’m@it). @d1Cannot be purified@bo. I.e., if you want to purify it from its impurity you must break it until it is no longer fit for its original use. If it was made to hold food items, one makes a hole until olives would fall out, and if it was made for liquids, he bores a hole until it can no longer hold liquid. @p1[34]@p2<TIE>To the verse@bo. This is because it is not connected with the juxtaposed verse: “you shall break it.” The meaning of “@hh<HEB>אשר יבא עליו מים@ee<ENG> (upon which water @ITcomes@it),” is: “@hh<HEB>אשר באו עליו@ee<ENG> (upon which [water] @ITcame@it).” This is because the expression @hh<HEB>אשר יבא@ee<ENG> [seemingly] instructs that after the food was within the impure earthenware vessel — if water will come upon it — it will become impure. This, however, is not so, for the Torah enjoins (v. 38): “If water was once placed on seeds and part of their carcasses fall upon them” — then it will become impure. Rashi then adds: “While it is within an unclean earthenware vessel.” So that you will not say that since the food entered the interior of an impure vessel and then was taken out from the vessel, it will become impure if water now came upon it, because we would say the impurity returned and awakened after the water came upon it. Therefore, Rashi says: “[Water comes] while it is within the vessel” (@ITRe’m@it). @d1Even when dry. @boThis is because Scripture makes its being subject to impurity dependant only on whether water comes on it, without specifying; it does not differentiate whether it is dry or moist. @d1Food or liquid become unclean from the interior of an earthenware vessel. @boRe’m writes:@BO @boIt seems to me that the phrase “or liquid” is a misprint, and the correct text is “food becomes unclean from the interior of an earthenware vessel,” and not “food @ITor@it @ITliquid@it.” This is because the word “beverage” that is written in the verse was already explained by Rashi as referring to preparing it for impurity, and according to Rabbi Eliezer, but it does not refer to causing impurity from a beverage, as the view of Rabbi Yuda and Rabbi Yossi (Pesachim 16a). If so, [that “beverage” refers to preparing for impurity], how could Rashi write later: “Furthermore, our Rabbis learned from here [food @ITor liquid@it becomes unclean from the interior of an earthenware vessel, but not vessels]<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”? Also, in Toras Kohanim and in Pesachim (20b) it is only written: “Food becomes impure from the interior of an earthenware vessel, but vessels do not become impure from the interior of an earthenware vessel.” @d1After it had been picked@bo. Meaning: After the food had been detached from the earth, otherwise, there is no [vegetation] that had not been exposed to water [through rain], so why then does it say [impurity is only applicable]: “Upon which water comes”? @d1Unless there is an egg’s-volume@bo. I.e., people that eat less than this amount are not impure. However, this does not mean that food does not cause other items to become impure when it does not have this amount, because even if it has the minimum amount through which it becomes impure it does not cause other things to become impure. This is because foodstuffs do not cause other foodstuffs to become impure by Torah law (so I found). The fact that it does not cause impurity to other things is derived from [the fact] that Scripture does not write @hh<HEB>טמא@ee<ENG> but rather, @hh<HEB>יטמא@ee<ENG>, which is as if it says: It is impure but it will not cause other things to become impure. @p1[35]@p2<TIE>Which may be moved@bo. [Rashi knows this] because if they were vessels that are not movable, but rather attached to the ground, they would not become impure, for every item attached to the ground is like the ground [which does not become impure]. And from the fact it is written, “it shall be shattered,” which implies it cannot be purified in a mikveh, Rashi infers that the verse refers to earthenware vessels. And since they are earthenware vessels, we must say they have an interior, for earthenware vessels become impure only from their interior. However, this does not mean specifically earthenware, for an oven is not fired in a kiln. Rather, since ovens are made from clay and dried in the sun they are called earthenware, and they have the same law as earthenware vessels (@ITRe’m@it). This raises a difficulty: Scripture already wrote the law of earthenware vessels, as it is written (v. 33): “Every earthen vessel”! Re’m wrote that an earthenware vessel is fired [in a kiln] and is made from clay, but the oven and hearth are only made from clay and dried in the sun. However, I do not know what difference this makes. Thus, it appears to me that above it lets us know that an earthenware vessel that became impure can be rectified through purification by breakage, as it says in Toras Kohanim: “And you shall break it” — it has rectification through breaking it. [If it was used for food] he breaks it partially until it has a hole that makes it unable to be used for foodstuff. If Scripture had only written the verse above, I would think (v. 33) “and you shall break it” means entirely, and it cannot be purified by partially breaking it. Thus, the verse (35): “it shall be shattered” lets us know, [because] it means that it cannot be purified through immersing [in a mikveh] and remain as it is. Boring a hole, however, helps. This is because we cannot say “it shall be shattered” means literally [to completely shatter it], for it says afterwards “and they shall be unclean to you,” upon which Rashi explains he is not obligated to shatter it, but may keep it for the days when he is impure. However, [if it only said this verse, “and he shall shatter it,” I might think it has no purification in a mikveh and he must keep it for the days of his impurity, but] to purify it through breakage does not help, thus, it lets us know with the verse above that it can be purified through boring a hole (@ITDivrei Dovid@it). @p1[36]@p2<TIE>Attached@bo. You might ask: Above, Rashi derives that (v. 34): “Every beverage that is drunk, in any vessel, shall be impure” refers to the preparation [of foodstuffs] for impurity, and not impurity [of liquids themselves]. This is because Rashi holds like the view that there is no impurity of liquids by Torah law, and this is according to Rabbi Eliezer’s view (Pesachim 16a). Here, though, Rashi explains that specifically the water attached to the ground do not acquire impurity. Hear from this that @ITthere is@it impurity of liquids by Torah law, which follows the view of Rabbi Yuda (ibid.)! The answer is: This is why Rashi adds: “Moreover, you have still to learn<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” which is according to Rabbi Eliezer. [You might ask:] Why does Rashi not say, “And there are those that explain”? The answer is: Rabbi Yuda would also agree with this, for he holds that both can be derived, since they are equal, and therefore both may be learned (@ITRe’m@it). It appears that there is proof for both these teachings, for the first explanation alone presents a difficulty: Why does it say: @hh<HEB>יהי' טהור@ee<ENG>? Why doe we need the word @hh<HEB>יהי'@ee<ENG>? Rather, it refers to someone who is now impure that he can be pure through immersion in these waters. And the second explanation alone poses a difficulty [as well:] What is the relevancy of this to here, which deals with the way in which a vessel acquires impurity? Perforce, here also it lets us know that water cannot become impure in any way (@ITDivrei Dovid@it). @d1Well-spring or pit. @boI.e., if he touches a carcass and he is inside a well-spring or pit, he becomes impure. This exegesis is based on the extra verse, which is expounded as follows: “However, a well-spring and a pit, a gathering of water” — an impure person that immerses in them — “shall be pure.” But — a pure person that stands in them and touches a creeping creature that falls into it — “shall be unclean.” @d1For you should not propose a @HB<HEB>ק"ו@ee<ENG>. Re’m writes: However, [the Rabbis] taught in Toras Kohanim: The earth uplifts impure items from their impurity, for if impure seeds were planted, which then took root in the earth, they become pure, and a mikveh also purifies the impure, thus, just as the earth saves the pure, i.e., the seeds that take root in the earth [are saved] from becoming impure, so too, water [accomplishes] the same. Therefore, it says: “That which touches their carcasses shall be unclean” — water does not save from becoming impure. @p1[37]@p2<TIE>To be called “food.” @boMeaning: From that which it is written in the next verse: “If water was once placed on seeds and part of their carcasses fall upon them, they are unclean,” it implies that previously where it is written, “it remains [ritually] clean,” is dealing in a case where a part of their carcasses fell upon them before water came upon them. See Re’m where he cites the difficulties raised by Toras Kohanim and the Talmud: Why do we need a verse when it can be derived from that above (v. 34)? He brings the answers the Sages answered there. This raises a difficulty: This can be derived from (v. 38): “If water was once placed,” which implies that without water it cannot become impure! It appears to me that upon analysis of Scripture that first it says: “on any sowing seed that will be planted,” and then afterwards it says, “If water was once placed on seeds” where it mentions only “seeds.” Consequently, one could err and make a distinction between seeds that grow on their own without planting and those that are planted. I might think that when we say seeds are prepared to acquire impurity specifically through water being placed on them — that refers only to seeds that grew on their own without any action, but seeds that were planted and designated as food do not need require that they be prepared with water [in order to become impure]. Therefore, Scripture lets me know [that this is not true] (@ITDivrei Dovid@it). @p1[38]@p2<TIE>Or other liquids@bo. For we derive a @ITgezeirah shavah@it from @hh<HEB>מים מים@ee<ENG>, from the word @hh<HEB>מים@ee<ENG> above (v. 34) regarding earthenware vessels, where other liquids are regarded the same as water. @d1Whether the seed falls into them@bo. As it is written: “If water was once placed on seeds,” and it is written nearby: “@hh<HEB>ונפל וגו'@ee<ENG> (and falls<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.).” [Thus,] the word @hh<HEB>ונפל@ee<ENG> should also be read with what precedes it: And seed falls into water. [And the word @hh<HEB>זרע@ee<ENG> is interpreted both with the previous phrase and the next phrase: “Water upon seed,” and “seeds falls<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”] (@ITRe’m@it). @p1[39]@p2<TIE>Not bones@bo. Meaning: This is when they are separated from where they are attached. But when they are attached to the flesh, one who touches them is like he is touching the flesh — either because they serve as a ‘handle’ or as a ‘protective agent.’ @p1[40]@p2<TIE>The uncleanness of carrying is more severe. @boI explained this above (v. 25). [You might ask:] Why does Rashi explain this here when he already explained it above? The answer is: Since it is written here: “Whoever eats of its carcass” — To provide a [minimum] measure for one who carries or touches [it] — I might think that since Scripture equates them for the minimum measure of impurity, the same also applies for the washing of clothing. For this reason, Rashi needed to once again explain here. We should not ask: How does Rashi know this? Re’m already answered: Since Scripture would not have neglected to mention in some place regarding impurity [caused by] touch that one must wash his clothing. @d1Perhaps. @boRashi explains this out of order, after the phrase “Whoever carries its carcass,” so that he could connect the one who carries with the one who touches — to inform us about the difference between them, that is, that the impurity of carrying is more severe than the impurity of touch, as explained above, for otherwise, what is it coming to let us know? @d1As much as for eating — and that is an olive’s-bulk. @boThat is, a @IThalf of an egg@it. [You might ask:] Rashi explains above (v. 34): “food which is eaten in one [gulp], and the Sages estimated that the gullet cannot hold more than a hen’s egg [at once],” i.e., @ITan entire egg@it! [The answer is:] That is referring to a forced situation and here it is referring to an unforced situation. This raises a strong difficulty: In the end, it is not possible that Scripture should write a falsehood! The one who eats it does not need to wash his clothing, only the one who carries it! It appears to me: Certainly, the verse goes according to its plain meaning, that is, whoever eats of its carcass, in that he stuck it into his gullet by himself, is not impure due to the eating but he is impure due to carrying the [minimal] amount of eating (@ITGur Aryeh@it). @d1The setting of the sun@bo. I already explained this above regarding (v. 32): “shall be brought [put] into water, and remains unclean until the evening,” and here its explanation is the same. Re’m explains this in another way: Although he immerses [in a mikveh] he needs the setting of the sun, for if not, it should say: “After he washes with water he shall be pure.” “@hh<HEB>הערב שמש@ee<ENG>” means the setting of the sun, which is the coming out of the stars, for the expression @hh<HEB>וטהר@ee<ENG> (22:7) means the cleansing of the @ITday@it. Otherwise, it should say @hh<HEB>ויטהר@ee<ENG> (Berachos 2b). Rashi explains this here and not in another place [where it says “he is unclean until the evening”] because this verse does not come to teach that he should be impure until the evening [and not seven days] as the others. Rather, it teaches the minimal amount for the one who carries or touches. Meaning, although it says in Parshas Emor (22:7): “@hh<HEB>ובא השמש וטהר@ee<ENG> (When the sun sets he is pure),” that is said in regard to the other types of impurity, but this one is for the carcass of an animal. The Torah writes it for both. Up to this point are the words of Re’m, but I wrote what appears [to be correct] in my eyes (@ITMinchas Yehudah@it). @p1[41]@p2<TIE>Short feet@bo. You might ask: How does this relate to what Rashi explained beforehand? He should have brought this explanation on the verse! The answer is: This is so that you will not contend: Perhaps “@hh<HEB>לא יאכל@ee<ENG> (it may not be eaten)” comes to prohibit one from deriving any benefit from @hh<HEB>שרצים@ee<ENG> (creeping creatures), and the phrase (v. 42): “@hh<HEB>לא תאכלם@ee<ENG> (you may not eat them)” of @hh<HEB>שרצים@ee<ENG> comes to prohibit eating a creature which is low with short feet although it is not considered [in the category of] @hh<HEB>שרצים@ee<ENG>. For this reason Rashi explains: “[The word] @hh<HEB>שרץ@ee<ENG> denotes only a [creature which is low, with short feet].” If so, something low @ITis@it the @hh<HEB>שרצים@ee<ENG> spoken of in the Torah. Therefore, “@hh<HEB>לא תאכלם@ee<ENG>” (v. 42) comes only with regard to @hh<HEB>שרצים@ee<ENG>. Consequently, perforce, “@hh<HEB>לא יאכל@ee<ENG>” (v. 41) does not come to teach a prohibition of deriving benefit, for later it is written, “@hh<HEB>לא תאכלם@ee<ENG>” (see Pesachim 21b). Similarly, that which Rashi explains above (v. 13): “Any fowl of which it is said: ‘to its kind’<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” needs to be explained in this way (so I found). @p1[42]@p2<TIE>Worms@bo. These are the long worms that come out of the ground that have no legs, found in garbage, and especially in the summer days after the rain stops. @d1And whatever is similar to anything similar to it@bo. I.e., they have slight signs of legs but they crawl on their belly like a snake. @p1[44]@p2<TIE>As I am holy@bo. Meaning, because every use of the word @hh<HEB>כי@ee<ENG> is to provide a reason for what precedes it. Therefore Rashi explains: “Just as I<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @d1Sanctify yourselves. @boThis is an extra phrase, for it would be sufficient to say: “You shall sanctify yourselves for I am Holy,” [and omit the phrase: “and you shall become holy”]. Rather, it is extra in order to expound in this manner. @d1Many negative commandments. @boOtherwise, it is already written above (v. 43): “and do not make yourselves unclean<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”<QC>
@p1[47]@p2<TIE>You must know@bo. Meaning: That which it cautions: “To distinguish<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” is not only that he should learn and know their laws, but he also needs to put in an effort so that he is able to recognize which is impure and which is pure as well. @d1A donkey and a cow. @boMeaning: Their signs were already explained as to which are impure and which are pure. If so, why does it say: “To distinguish”? @d1That which is clean to you@bo. Meaning: What is unclean for you by your own doing or clean for you by your own doing. @d1And when the greater part of has been cut through@bo. I.e., if you slaughter the animal’s entire gullet but only half of the wind-pipe, you have made it unclean for eating although it is a clean species. However, when [the entire gullet and] the greater part of the wind-pipe is cut, you have made it clean for eating. Although it was forbidden to be eaten until now due to the prohibition of a limb from a living animal (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it). @d1Characteristics [which render the animal] forbidden [but] it is kosher. @boFor instance, the windpipe had a hole, or the skull was opened but the brain’s membrane was not pierced, and the like, which are kosher. @d1Characteristics [which render the animal] forbidden@bo. And these are all the eighteen treifos enumerated by the Sages. See all this in the Chazkuni commentary. Chazkuni writes: “Between [those] in which there have arisen characteristics [which render the animal] forbidden [but] it is kosher” — for instance, he cut the wind-pipe and then the lung developed a hole before he cut the gullet, which is a characteristic of treifah but it is kosher, because the lung’s vitality depends on the wind-pipe [and the lung is as if it is “placed in a basket” after the wind-pipe is severed, thus, it has no influence on the kashrus of the animal]. “And [those] in which there have arisen characteristics [which render the animal] forbidden and it is [indeed] not kosher” — for instance, the lung developed a hole before the cutting of the wind-pipe. This is found in Maseches Chulin (32b). However, I say this is not the way, since Rashi did not say these words on his own, but rather, it is a Baraisa in Toras Kohanim, and the majority agree that the halachah is not like Reish Lakish [who says if he cut the wind-pipe and then the lung developed a hole before cutting the gullet it is kosher] (@ITTzeidah L’Derech@it).<QC>
@p1[2]@p2<TIE>In the Work of Creation.@p3 You might ask: Why did the creation of animals and beasts precede the creation of man? The Sages already answered in Sanhedrin (38a): “Why was man created on Erev Shabbos? So that they [i.e., the heretics] would not say Hashem had a partner in the Work of Creation. Another explanation: Because if man would be haughty they can say to him: The mosquito preceded you. Another explanation: So that he would immediately become obligated in a mitzvah [Shabbos]. Another explanation: So that he would find everything immediately prepared for his meal. This can be compared to a king<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” You might ask: If the Torah explains according to the order of creation, then Parshas Metzoro should come before Parshas Ki Tazria, because Metzoro speaks of a man and Tazria speaks of a woman, and Adam was created before Chavah! The answer is: It is more common for a woman gives birth than for a man to become afflicted with @ITtzora’as@it. Furthermore, we can say: The reason Tazria comes before Metzoro is because the main reason a person is afflicted with @ITtzora’as@it is because he has relations with his wife when she is a menstruant, as the Gemara says (Erachin 16a, and Tanchuma Tazria 11). Another answer: The woman is compared to the earth’s soil, which causes what is planted (@hh<HEB>שזורעים@ee<ENG>) in it to grow. Man, as well, was created from the earth’s soil. Therefore, it is written regarding a woman: “When [a woman] conceives (@hh<HEB>תזריע@ee<ENG>) and gives birth to a male child,” i.e., the male is created from the female who is likened to the earth’s soil. This raises a difficulty: What practical difference does this comparison make? Furthermore, Re’m raised the difficulty that the Gemora says in Sanhedrin (38a) that the reason Adam was created last was so that if he would be haughty it can be said to him: The mosquito preceded you in the work of creation, and so that he would find everything prepared for his meal, [and more reasons,] all of which are not applicable here! He also asks: Why does it mention the law [of @ITtzora’as@it]: “When a man will have in the skin of his flesh” after the law pertaining to a woman: “When [a woman] conceives”? The woman was created last! It appears to me the answer is: All this is what R. Simlai [who is cited in Rashi] means to say: Just as there is a good reason why Adam was created last — so that he would come and find everything ready for his meal — so too, regarding the law of man: It was explained after the laws of animals, beasts and birds, i.e., with regard to what is forbidden and permitted [among them]. This follows what it says in the Midrash (Vayikro Rabboh 13:3) on the verse (11:2): “These are the living things” — “Every word of Hashem is refined” (Mishlei 30:5), “The mitzvos were given to Israel” — i.e., what is forbidden to be eaten — “only for the sake of refining the people with them.” In this way Hashem demonstrates his love for us, as it says in the Midrash that someone who loves his servant cautions him from eating harmful food. Therefore, R. Simlai said that just as Adam was created last at the time of Creation for his advantage, so that he find his provisions prepared, so too, regarding Torah and mitzvos, Hashem gave them to Israel for their benefit, to refine them. Therefore, mankind was mentioned last so that they would have the refinement of mitzvos by means of the laws pertaining to animals, beasts and birds. Therefore, there is no difficulty posed from: “When a man will have, in the skin of his flesh” [the law of @ITtzora’as@it of a man is mentioned after the section dealing with a woman], for there [the concept of] refinement is not relevant (@ITDivrei Dovid@it). @d1Mushy.@bo [Rashi knows this] because it should only say: “When a woman gives birth to a male child.” [Why does it add “conceives”?] Rather, this comes to include even [when the embryo] is born mushy. One should not object: [The Rabbis taught (Berachos 60a)]: This teaches that if a woman emits seed first [the child will be a male, thus,] it is needed for that! [The answer is:] If so, it should say: “@hh<HEB>כי תזריע האשה וילדה זכר@ee<ENG>.” Rather, it juxtaposes “conception” to “giving birth” and writes @hh<HEB>וילדה זכר@ee<ENG> with a @hh<HEB>ו@ee<ENG>, which indicates certainty, and does not write “if,” the way it does (v. 5): “@ITIf@it she gives birth to a female.” Perforce you have both [explanations]. [You might ask:] Rashi explains above in Parshas Vayigash (Bereishis 46:15): “These are the sons of Leah<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. along with his daughter Deenah.” — “The males are attributed to Leah while the females are attributed to Yaakov, to teach you that if the woman emits seed first then she will give birth to a male [and if the man emits seed first then she will give birth to a female].” Why is this needed? It is derived from here! The answer is: From here we can only derive that a woman who emits seed [first] gives birth [to a male], however, [it is inconclusive in the event] the man emits seed first or they both emit simultaneously, that she will give birth to a female. Therefore, Scripture lets us know: “along with his daughter Deenah,” that if they [both] emit seed simultaneously they each cancel the other [and she will give birth to a male or female]. And from there alone, however, it cannot be derived, because we can say Scripture attributes the males to Leah because it cannot attribute them to Yaakov, who had other male children, [and if it said “these are the sons of Yaakov” I might think that these alone are the sons of Yaakov]. The female [Deenah] was attributed to him, though, since he had no other daughter besides her. [Thus,] from both [verses] it is derived well. Re’m dwelt at length on this but I shortened it (@ITMinchas Yehudah@it). @d1As semen@bo. Rashi’s explanation implies that first, before it was born, it was somewhat formed as a fetus, but afterwards it became crushed. [He knows this] from what is written, “when [a woman] conceives,” which implies even if she only gave birth to something resembling semen. But it is written, “and gives birth to a male child,” implying that it was a fully formed embryo. How [can this be resolved]? Perforce, we must say that originally it was a fully formed fetus, but afterwards it was crushed and became as semen. @d1Mentioned in regard to a menstruant woman@bo. She causes impurity due to lying down or sitting, as does a menstruant woman, and all the laws of impurity apply to her. You might ask: How does Rashi know this? Perhaps the verse means: “as the days of her menstrual flow” — which is seven days — so too, the amount of impurity for childbirth is seven days. The answer is: This would not require a verse, for it clearly says: “she will be ritually unclean for seven days.” If so, why does it say: “as the days of her menstrual flow”? Rather, it comes to teach about other [laws of menstrual] impurity. You might ask: This is obvious! She is a menstruant woman, for at the time of her difficulty [in birth] she saw blood. Therefore, Rashi explains: “even if the womb opens without blood.” @d1Which flows@bo. [Rashi knows this] because the @hh<HEB>ז@ee<ENG> is interchangeable with the @hh<HEB>ד@ee<ENG>, as [we see from the fact that] the Aramaic translation of @hh<HEB>זב@ee<ENG> (discharge flow) is @hh<HEB>דב@ee<ENG> (15:2) [and the @hh<HEB>ו@ee<ENG> and the @hh<HEB>ב@ee<ENG> are interchangeable since they have the same source of pronunciation]. If so, it is as if Scripture had written @hh<HEB>זבותה@ee<ENG> (her flow). @p1[4]@p2<TIE>Even if@bo. Otherwise, why does it say: “@hh<HEB>בדמי@ee<ENG>”? Alternatively, this is the explanation: Would it be insufficient that she does not see blood, that it was written with the expression “@hh<HEB>תשב בדמי@ee<ENG> (she will remain in the blood)”? Therefore, Rashi explains: “even if [she sees blood]<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”<QC>
@d1To one who eats@bo. As it is written nearby: “and she shall not come into the Sanctuary,” and the one who enters the Sanctuary in impurity is liable @ITkoreis@it (excision), as it is written at the beginning of Parshas Chukas (Bamidbar 19:20). [Thus,] the Gemora (Yevamos 75a) makes a comparison between “she shall not touch anything holy” and one who enters the Sanctuary, just as one who enters the Sanctuary involves @ITkoreis@it, so too, when it is written, “she shall not touch anything holy,” it refers to @ITkoreis@it. If so, perforce we must say that “she shall not touch” is a warning to one who eats, for one who eats sacrifices in the state of impurity is liable [@ITkoreis@it. Regarding @ITterumoh@it, though, which Rashi derives above from “anything holy,” the punishment is] death [at the hands of Heaven], as it is written (22:9): “And die because of it for having profaned.” However, one who touches sacrifices in the state of impurity is not liable @ITkoreis@it [and the reason the verse teaches eating with an expression of ‘touching’ is to let us know that one who is forbidden to eat sacrifices may also not touch them]. Furthermore, we can say that Rashi [knows that ‘touch’ refers to eating from that which he] explains nearby “anything holy” — “to include [@ITterumoh@it].” Perforce, he did not intend to explain the verse, for the phrase “anything holy” is written before “she shall not touch,” so why does Rashi reverse the order? Rather, this refers to what precedes his explanation on “anything holy.” And this is its explanation: “She shall not touch” — “A warning to one who eats,” but how do we know it is a warning to one who eats? Thus, he explains: Because “anything holy” includes @ITterumoh@it, and “she shall not touch” also refers to it. If so, we cannot say “she shall not touch” is a warning for actual touching, since it is permissible to touch @ITterumoh@it immediately after immersing [in a @ITmikveh@it], and she immersed immediately after the seven days. A @hh<HEB>טבול יום@ee<ENG> (one who immersed and is waiting for sunset) is permitted to touch @ITterumoh@it. Rather, [it must be] a warning for one who eats. This raises a difficulty: In the verse it is written @hh<HEB>קדש@ee<ENG> (holy) and not @ITterumoh@it! Upon this Rashi answers: The proof is from that which it is written: “until the @ITdays@it of her purity are completed,” which is applicable only to @ITterumoh@it, “for this one is [considered] as one who has immersed [in a @ITmikveh@it but whose purification is concluded only] after a long day, [thus,] the expression “days” is applicable to her. However, sacrifices cannot be eaten until one brings his [sacrifice of] atonement, and it does not depend on days alone. [Thus,] although the [warning] itself comes for one who eats sacrifices, nevertheless, the exclusion from “anything” comes to prohibit eating @ITterumoh@it (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it). @d1One who has immersed after a long day@bo. Meaning: We need not ask: Terumoh is permissible to be eaten after the sunset, so why should it be forbidden to be eaten after the end of the seven days? Rashi answers: “For this one is as one who has immersed after a long day<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” until the fortieth day when they bring their offerings of childbirth, and at sunset before the fortieth day she is permitted to eat @ITterumoh@it. @p1[7]@p2<TIE>One of them@bo. Rashi is answering the question: Scripture should have written: “He will bring @ITthem@it” since childbirth requires two offerings — a lamb in its first year and a young pigeon or turtledove. Rather, [it must be:] “This teaches you<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @d1On it the purification depends@bo. For in every place regarding to the sin-offering it is written: “The @ITkohein@it will atone for him and he shall be forgiven.” [You might ask:] Why does Rashi bring the verse at the end of the section (v. 8) and not the verse preceding it (v. 7): “and atone for her and she will be cleansed”? The answer is: This verse (7) does not prove that the sin-offering comes for atonement, for perhaps the burnt-offering comes for atonement. The other verse (8), however, demonstrates this well, since it is written: “And one as a sin-offering<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” which implies that the sin-offering comes to atone. Another answer: Because the verse placed the burnt-offering before the sin-offering, and it placed it first “only for [the purpose of] reading [the Torah scroll].” However, this poses a difficulty: For what practical difference does Scripture place it first? Rather, it is to juxtapose “and he will atone” to “sinoffering” to teach that the atonement depends on the sin-offering. You might ask: Let the Merciful One [in the Torah] write [only]: “And he will atone” and it need not say, “And he will bring it,” and it would imply the one upon which the atonement depends! This is no difficulty, for Scripture had not written “and he will bring it” I might think that “he will atone” refers to the burnt-offering as well, since it is written regarding the burnt-offering (1:4): “And it will be favorably accepted from him to achieve his atonement.” However, now that it is written, “And he will bring it,” which implies one [of them], it is more reasonable to establish it as [referring to] the sin-offering that atones, since he is obligated to bring it to atone, and to exclude the burnt-offering that although it atones, he is not obligated to bring it as atonement. Even when the burnt-offering is obligatory, it comes as a present (@ITGur Aryeh@it). @d1That until now she is considered unclean@bo. Rashi’s view in this is so that you will not raise a difficulty upon what he explains (above): “only one of them prevents her from eating holy food,” if so, this implies only sacrifices are forbidden and not @ITterumoh@it. However, above he explains (v. 4): “Anything holy” — “to include @ITterumoh@it”; that it too, is forbidden to be eaten. Therefore, he explains: “And she will be cleansed. Therefore, [we learn] that until now she is considered unclean.” Perforce, this impurity refers to prohibiting [eating from] sacrifices, since @ITterumoh@it is permitted to be eaten from sunset of the fortieth day and onwards, which implies that sacrifices are prohibited [to be eaten] until after her atonement. Therefore, he explains: “from eating holy food.” @p1[8]@p2<TIE>[The verse] placed it first@bo. Meaning: For the purpose of reading the Torah that the one who reads in the Torah will read the word “burnt-offering” first, “but as to [the order of] offering<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” [You might ask:] Why does Rashi not explain this above, where it is written: “She shall bring a lamb, in its first year, as a burnt-offering and a young pigeon or a turtledove as a sin-offering”? This is because above it is logical that it should place the burnt-offering first, since it is speaking about a rich person who brings a lamb as a burnt-offering, and a young pigeon or a turtledove as a sin-offering, and even for bringing the offerings the burnt-offering comes first, since a lamb is more important. Here, however, [it is speaking] of a poor person who brings two turtledoves or two young pigeons, which are both the same, so I might think that also for bringing the offering the burnt-offering comes first since it was placed first, etc. Therefore, Rashi explains: “The verse placed it first<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1[2]@p2<TIE>A Scriptural decree.@bo Rashi’s view is so because it is written nearby: “He shall be brought to Aharon, the @ITkohein@it, or to one of his sons, the @ITkohanim@it.” Why does it need to say, “one”? Also, Scripture does not need to write, “of his sons, the @ITkohanim@it,” but rather only: “Or to his sons.” Thus, “one” comes to include even a non-@ITkohein@it, [in the case] that the @ITkohein@it was ignorant of Torah law he may show [the signs] to a man who knows [the laws of] signs of impurity, although he is a non-@ITkohein@it. And that which it is written afterwards, “of his sons the @ITkohanim@it” is to teach that although the @ITkohein@it does not know the signs of impurity, and needs to show [them] to a Torah scholar who may not be a @ITkohein@it, nevertheless, the Torah scholar is not allowed to say: This is a sign of impurity or this is a sign of purity. Rather, he must teach the @ITkohein@it the laws of impurity and purity so that the @ITkohein@it will tell the person who has the skin-eruption: You are pure or impure. Upon this Rashi explains: “It is a Scriptural decree<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”<QC>
@p1[3]@p2<TIE>Within the skin-eruption@bo. That which Rashi explains: “Within the skin-eruption” is to tell you that you should not think “has turned white” [means] if there is a white hair @ITnear@it the skin-eruption it is a sign of impurity. Therefore, he explains that only when it is within the skin-eruption. Also, you should not say that if it turned white before he has a skin-eruption it would be a sign of impurity, therefore, he explains: “Within the skin-eruption.” Furthermore, Rashi is answering the question: Since it is written in Scripture: “In the skin-eruption” — to say that only if the skin-eruption preceded the white hair, but if the white hair preceded the skin-eruption it is pure, hear from this that sometimes a hair can turn white even without a skin-eruption. If so, when the hair turns white within the skin-eruption it will not be impure, for perhaps it did not turn white due to the plague, maybe it was a some coincidence that it turned [white]. Thus, with regard to this Rashi explains: “The minimum [amount of] hair is two.” Since two hairs turned white, it is surely because of the plague and not a coincidence, for any matter [that occurs] in multiplicity is not a coincidence. @d1The minimum [amount of] hair is two@bo. I do not know how the Rabbis knew that @hh<HEB>שער@ee<ENG> indicates a multiplicity of hairs, etc. (@ITRe’m@it). See Tosafos Yom Tov, Negaim (4:1). @d1As the appearance of the sun@bo. [Rashi knows this] because it is written, “and the appearance of the plague [is deeper]<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” which implies that the @ITappearance@it is deeper than his flesh and not that the plague is actually deeper than his flesh. Why does the white appearance seem deeper? The answer is: Because a person’s main vision is through the black in his eye, and when he looks at something that has black and white, for instance: the sun which is white and shade which is black, it seems to him the black is closer to him that the white, because the black in the eye receives more of the vision of something that is black than something white. @d1He must say to him@bo. I.e., not that he should manually make him impure with something that is one of the Fathers of impurity. And this is what Rashi writes, “for white hair is a sign of uncleanness<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1[4]@p2<TIE>I do not know its [proper] interpretation@bo. It appears that Rashi is bothered by the difficulty: It should say: “@hh<HEB>ואין מראה עמוק מן העור@ee<ENG>,” [instead of @hh<HEB>ועמוק אין מראה@ee<ENG>]! So Rashi answers: If Scripture had written so, it would imply that the appearance is not deep at all. If so, it would pose a difficulty: Why does it require confinement, since it does not have a white appearance and the hair has not turned white? Now, however, that it says: “@hh<HEB>ועמוק אין מראה@ee<ENG>,” it implies that there is a small amount of depth [appearance], but it is not deeper than the skin. Thus, it does not have the minimal amount, and it has not reached [the level of] the four appearances [as described in Mishnah Negaim (1:1)]. Nevertheless, it is deep and therefore requires confinement. With regard to this Rashi says: “I do not know its interpretation,” i.e., the explanation of its minimal amount: which depth requires confinement and which depth does not require confinement. Divrei Dovid explains in this way as well, and he follows his view (see there). Rashi [said he does not know] because it posed a difficulty to him: Since a snow-white spot (@hh<HEB>בהרת@ee<ENG>) is white, why is it not deeper [in appearance] than the skin? Every white appearance is deeper than the dark [background], as I explained! Due to this difficulty, Rashi did not know the verse’s explanation. Ramban explains similarly. The explanation lying behind his explanation is that according to the view of Rambam and Rashi all the four appearances [of the signs of skineruptions] are deeper [than the skin]. They explain that a spot of intense whiteness (@hh<HEB>שאת@ee<ENG>) is slightly higher [in appearance] than @hh<HEB>בהרת@ee<ENG>, as Rashi explains in Shavuos (5b), and so the Kesef Mishneh explains in Hilchos Tzora’as (1:6). However, it was momentarily hidden from the Beis Yosef that Rashi explains the same way as he explained Rambam. This is not so according to the view of Targum Yonoson and Ra’avad, [who explain] that @hh<HEB>שאת@ee<ENG> is higher [than the skin itself], according to the plain meaning of the Baraisa, and only the strong @hh<HEB>בהרת@ee<ENG> is deeper [than the skin]. And if we explain, “@hh<HEB>ועמוק אין מראה@ee<ENG>” according to the view of Rabbi Akiva, [it means] as compared to the skin of a white man. However, the Sages said: These and these are [judged] like an average person, i.e., for a German (who is very white) or a Kushi (Ethiopian, very dark skinned), we place medium-darkness paint around the skin-eruption [to judge it]. Still, it remains difficult: Which medium paint? There are a number of levels of “medium”! [Thus,] Rashi did not know how to interpret this (@ITRav Yaakov Trivash@it). Ramban answered this question according to the view he had in Rashi’s opinion. [Rashi was bothered by the difficulty mentioned above that a white mark will always appear “deeper” than a dark background. Ramban explains that since the hair has not turned white, the skin-eruption’s whiteness is dimmed by the black hair within it, and so it does not seem so deep]. @d1One house@bo. Meaning: The @ITkohein@it confines the man afflicted; as a result, the plague is confined as well. [It does] not [mean] he should cover the skin-eruption for seven days (@ITRe’m@it). [Rashi explains this] so that you should not say that during the seven days he might be confined once in this place and another time in that place in a way that each day is a [different] confinement. Therefore, Rashi explains that the confinement should be one time in one house, and he will not be seen seven days. This excludes that if he would be seen during the seven days, even if the skin-eruption spreads, he is not impure, because possibly it could change at the end (@ITDivrei Dovid@it). @p1[5]@p2<TIE>Its appearance and original size.@bo That which Rashi explains also, “and original size” is not an explanation of the expression @hh<HEB>בעיניו@ee<ENG>. Rather, it refers to what it is written, “the skin-eruption did not spread,” rather, it is still its original size. You might ask: Why does Rashi need to explain this? It is clearly written: “The skin-eruption did not spread”! Furthermore, Rashi should have explained this on the verse: “Did not spread” — “And is like its original size.” Another difficulty: That which Rashi explains: “And confine him .<TIE>.<TIE>. a second time.” — “Thus, if it spread<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” — This is obvious, since it says, “and behold! <TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. did not spread .<TIE>.<TIE>. [the @ITkohein@it] shall confine him<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” which implies that if it did spread he is definitely impure. The answer is: Rashi’s view is to say that we must infer that it is in its original appearance and also its original size — that the skin-eruption did not spread — then, he must be confined a second time and he is not yet definitely impure. However, if it spread he is definitely impure. [Accordingly, the s.v. “And confine him .<TIE>.<TIE>. a second time” is actually a continuation of the s.v. “Maintained its hue,” and they are both parts of one s.v.]. However, you should not infer [from the word] @hh<HEB>בעיניו@ee<ENG> [that it means] only if it is in its original appearance, then he must be confined, but if it did not maintain its original appearance, for instance, it became whiter, he would be definitely impure, for this is not relevant: Since it was already white [which is a sign of impurity] it is not relevant that it becomes whiter. Rather, we should infer that only if it maintains its original appearance, that is, its original whiteness, and also it did not spread, i.e., from its original size, then he needs to be confined. However, if the skin-eruption spread and remained in its original whiteness, he is definitely impure. But if it did not maintain its hue, for instance, it became less white, even though the skin-eruption spread, it is still not definitely impure. This is because it is not written, “or it did not spread,” which would imply either this or that. These are the principles of Re’m’s explanation, see there at length. However, he raises a difficulty there: Why did [the Rabbis] teach [in a Mishnah] (Negaim 3:3) there are three signs of impurity: the white hair, healthy flesh, and spreading? There are actually four, including the maintaining of their hue! This can be resolved: [The Rabbis] taught in the Mishnah only those signs of impurity that pertain to the first week; this is not the case of maintaining their hue, which is relevant to the second week. @d1If it spread@bo. Although the entire Torah is general rules, and from the negative rule you derive the positive one, [Rashi needs to explain here] because two inferences that can be derived from here: One is, “if it spread,” and the other is, “if [its hue] became stronger.” [Therefore,] he needs to say that the inference here is only one: “If it spread,” and not “if it became stronger.” This is because even if its appearance became stronger, since the first and the last appearances are both appearances of impurity, we apply the verse that it “maintained its hue” (@ITRe’m@it). @p1[6]@p2<TIE>Or it spread, he is impure@bo. I.e., you should not infer: [If it] became dimmer than its [original] appearance, even though the skin-eruption spread, or it did not spread, even though it maintained its hue — he does not need confinement and is pure. Rather, you should infer: [If it] became dimmer and also it did not spread, then he does not need confinement and he is pure, as it implies: “became dimmer @ITand@it [the skin-eruption] did not spread.” But, if it maintained its appearance even though it did not spread, or it spread even though it became dimmer, he must be confined and is impure. This is implied nearby: “If [the white discoloration] has spread,” and it is not written: “And it maintains its hue.” [Thus,] it implies either this or that (@ITMinchas Yehudah@it). [This contradicts what Re’m explained in Rashi above, however, see Ramban: “This is the implication of the verse, but according to the drashah of Chazal it is not so (Negaim 1:3).” There, it is explained that after the second week even if it maintains its hue, as long as it does not spread, it is pure. See also Divrei Dovid]. @p1[8]@p2<TIE>And a sacrifice@bo. I.e., this is not the case regarding a @ITmetzoro@it who is [only] confined, who does not have any of these. Because the impurity of a confined @ITmetzoro@it is mentioned here as well as the impurity of a @ITmetzoro@it who is definitely impure, as [we see that] “impurity” is mentioned with regard to both of them, as it is written concerning the confined one, “and he shall wash his clothing,” which implies that he is impure, and regarding the definitely impure it is written, “the @ITkohein@it shall declare him unclean<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” [Therefore,] Rashi here lets us know the difference between them as well. @d1This@bo. Rashi needs to explain this because @hh<HEB>מספחת@ee<ENG> (white discoloration) is the special name for a pure skin-eruption, [therefore,] he needs to explain that the word @hh<HEB>היא@ee<ENG> refers to the word @hh<HEB>המספחת@ee<ENG>, and its explanation is that the skineruption, which we would have thought is a @hh<HEB>מספחת@ee<ENG> and thus pure, is actually @ITtzora’as@it and is impure. Above, however, concerning (v. 6): “@hh<HEB>מספחת היא@ee<ENG> (it is [merely] a white discoloration),” it surely refers to the word @hh<HEB>בהרת@ee<ENG> above, and since @hh<HEB>בהרת@ee<ENG> is a general expression for every brightly hued skin-eruption, it is fine to say, “@hh<HEB>מספחת היא@ee<ENG>,” that is, the mentioned above @hh<HEB>בהרת@ee<ENG> [is merely a white discoloration]. There, Rashi does not need to explain anything (@ITRe’m@it). @d1@HB<HEB>נגע@d1<ENG> is masculine@bo. Rashi is answering the question: Above, it is written, “@hh<HEB>נגע צרעת הוא@ee<ENG>” [in the masculine form] which implies that @ITtzora’as@it is masculine, but here it is written, “@hh<HEB>נגע צרעת כי תהיה@ee<ENG>,” which is the feminine form. For this reason Rashi explains: “Tzora’as is of feminine gender, but @hh<HEB>נגע@ee<ENG> is masculine.” Because of this, it is written above, “@hh<HEB>נגע צרעת הוא@ee<ENG>”; the word @hh<HEB>הוא@ee<ENG> refers to @hh<HEB>נגע@ee<ENG> which is masculine. @p1[10]@p2<TIE>As well as healthy [flesh] without white hair@bo. [Rashi knows this] because later in this section it is written (v. 14), “On the day that healthy flesh appears on him he will become unclean,” which implies that if there is healthy flesh he will become impure even when the hair does not turn white. If so, that which it is written here: “and it has turned the hair white or there is healthy flesh” means: The hair turned white without healthy flesh or there is healthy flesh without the hair turning white. @d1It is a sign of uncleanness@bo. [Rashi knows this] because we include from that which is written, “@hh<HEB>נגע צרעת@ee<ENG>”; why does Scripture need to write @hh<HEB>נגע@ee<ENG>? It should have written only @hh<HEB>צרעת@ee<ENG> [or only @hh<HEB>נגע@ee<ENG>]! Rather, [it must be that] it includes every appearance of a @hh<HEB>נגע@ee<ENG> if it has the signs which it continues to explain, constitutes a sign of impurity. @p1[11]@p2<TIE>It has produced healthy [flesh], I will declare it clean@bo. Re’m writes: This raises a strong difficulty: From here it implies that healthy flesh is a sign of purity, and therefore one [might] say: “Since it has produced healthy [flesh], I will declare it clean.” Above, however, Rashi says: “Or there is healthy flesh” — “This too is a sign of uncleanness<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”! It appears to me that Rashi is coming to answer why does Scripture need to write: “It is an old @ITtzora’as@it<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” It should have written only, “or there is healthy flesh in the spot of intense whiteness, and the @ITkohein@it shall declare him unclean.” Rashi answers that Scripture itself comes to give the reason why we declare him impure when he has healthy flesh, [since,] on the contrary, he should be declared pure because the skin-eruption has begun to heal since it has healthy flesh. For this reason Scripture explained: “It is an old @ITtzora’as@it.” @p1[12]@p2<TIE>Of a man@bo. And not from the head of the skin-eruption until its feet, for head and foot are not applicable with regard to it. Meaning: We should not say: from the head of the skin-eruption, for afterwards Scripture said: “The @ITkohein@it shall see and behold! The @ITtzora’as@it has covered all of his body” — of a man (@ITKitzur Mizrachi@it). @p1[14]@p2<TIE>Healthy [flesh] could be seen@bo. Meaning: “On the day” does not come to teach that the healthy flesh is a sign of impurity, since it has already indicated: “Or there is healthy flesh in the spot of intense whiteness, it is an old @ITtzora’as@it.” Rather, it teaches about the tips of the limbs where the skin eruption cannot be seen all at once, since [the limbs] slope on either side, [the healthy flesh will @ITnot@it be a sign of impurity,] as it is written: “[The @ITkohein@it] will see it,” [and the Rabbis taught in Toras Kohanim that he must see it] entirely [as one]. [If that limb subsequently became fat and the tip broadened so that its slope was exposed and now the entire skin-eruption can be seen at once,] I might think that since originally it was not seen in its entirety, now also, when it fattened and broadened and is entirely seen, the healthy flesh will [still] not be a sign of impurity. Therefore, it lets us know [that it is].<QC>
@d1From here they [the Sages] said: A bridegroom@bo. [Rashi knows this] because it should say [only]: “@hh<HEB>ובהראות@ee<ENG>.” @d1@HB<HEB>ולאיצטליתו@hb@ee<ENG>. Meaning: His clothing, for the Targum Onkeles of (Bereishis 45:22):@hh<HEB>חמש חליפות@ee<ENG> (and five changes of clothing) is @hh<HEB>חמש איצטלוון@ee<ENG>. @d1During a festival, he is given all the days of the festival.@bo Meaning: The @ITkohein@it may not declare other people [other than bridegrooms] impure during a festival, until after the festival passes. @p1[18]@p2<TIE>Because of a wound@bo. [This raises a strong difficulty: Why did Rashi not include an inflammation that came by itself and not because of a wound? (@ITRe’m@it)] It seems Rashi’s intention is that so much more so [there is impurity regarding] an inflammation which occurred by itself and not because of a wound. Rashi only comes to exclude an inflammation that was caused by a fire, since that is called a @hh<HEB>מכוה@ee<ENG> (burn). All this is obvious in Toras Kohanim and Chulin (8a). Re’m brought the Gemora in Chulin and the Toras Kohanim but did not realize it is a @ITkal vachomer,@it and therefore he wrote what he wrote (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it). @d1The inflammation@bo. [The inflammation healed] but not the flesh that had the inflammation, for you would not say the flesh “healed” as long as it has the @hh<HEB>שאת@ee<ENG> (spot of intense whiteness). Rather, it means the inflammation healed but the flesh is still afflicted. @p1[19]@p2<TIE>@HB<HEB>פתוך@ee<ENG>. In Shavuos (6a) Rashi explains @hh<HEB>פתוך@ee<ENG> means intermingled.<QC>
@p1[30]@p2<TIE>The black hair in it [turned] golden@bo. [Rashi knows this] from that which is written (v. 31): “When the @ITkohein@it will see the skin eruption of nesek,” [thus,] “skin-eruption” is connected to “nesek”: Just as [we find concerning] the skineruption the white hair in it only makes one impure if it turned [from being black], so too, a nesek, the golden hair in it only makes one impure if it turned, as if it said: “And the hair in the skin-eruption @ITturned@it golden.” @d1Such is the name@bo. Otherwise, why does it change the name of this impure skin-eruption from the name of the impure skin-eruption [mentioned] above, as it is written (v. 25): “it is the skin-eruption of @ITtzora’as@it”? (@ITRe’m@it). @p1[31]@p2<TIE>If there was a black hair in it, he is [ritually] clean@bo. [Rashi explains this] so that you will not explain: “And behold! it does not appear deeper than the skin,” even if it has a black hair, and I might think that a black hair is a sign of impurity, or if it has no black hair, even if its appearance is deeper than the skin, it requires confinement, and the @hh<HEB>ו@ee<ENG> of @hh<HEB>ושער שחור@ee<ENG> is like @hh<HEB>או@ee<ENG> (or). Therefore, Rashi explains that everything depends on the black hair, as it says: “And a black hair [grew in it, the nesek is healed, he is clean].”<QC>
@p1[32]@p2<TIE>Or there was in it a golden hair@bo. [Rashi explains this so] that you should not infer: “And behold, it did not spread,” even though it has a golden hair, or if it does not have a golden hair, even though it spread, it [only] requires confinement, and the @hh<HEB>ו@ee<ENG> of “@hh<HEB>ולא היה בו שער צהוב@ee<ENG> (and there was no golden hair in it)” is instead of @hh<HEB>או@ee<ENG> (or). If it had both signs, however, it would be definitely impure. Rather, you should infer as follows: “And behold, it did not spread” — and also — “there was no golden hair in it” — then, it requires confinement, as it implies: “And behold! the nesek did not spread and there was no golden hair in it,” the @hh<HEB>ו@ee<ENG> adds to the first subject. However, if it spread, even though it does not have a golden hair, or if it has a golden hair, even though it did not spread, it is unclean, as it is clearly written later in this section (v. 36): “The @ITkohein@it shall see him and behold! the nesek has spread in the skin. The @ITkohein@it shall not [even] look<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” This implies that he is impure immediately when it spreads even though there is no golden hair. Consequently, we say the opposite as well: If there is a golden hair even though it did not spread [it is impure] (@ITRe’m@it). @p1[37]@p2<TIE>@BITzohov@d1 [is] like @BIzohov@bo. That which Rashi explains this here and not above [where it says] (v. 30): “and there is a golden hair in it,” is because above it could be explained that whatever is not black is called @ITtzohov,@it but after he explains that red and green are included in the word “@hh<HEB>ושער@ee<ENG> (@ITand@it hair)” and are included in “black,” if so, it poses a difficulty: What does @ITtzohov@it mean? Thus, he explains, etc. (@ITDevek Tov@it).<QC>
@d1Thus, an unclean [person]. Is not clean@bo. You should not say since it is a Scriptural decree that the impurity and purity of skin-eruptions depends on the @ITkohein@it’s declaration, [and] although a skin-eruption has all the signs of impurity he is not impure as long as the @ITkohein@it does not say, “impure,” the same applies if he has signs of impurity and the @ITkohein@it declares him pure he will be pure. Therefore, it lets us know: “He is clean, and the @ITkohein@it shall declare him clean,” etc. Re’m writes: “The same applies if he was pure and the @ITkohein@it declared him impure, he is not impure.” This lets us know that the impurity of skin-eruptions and their purity are only according to the word of the @ITkohein@it, and the explanation is thus: Although a pure person developed certain signs of impurity, he only loses his previous presumption (@ITchazokoh@it) [of being pure] by the word of the @ITkohein@it who says to him, “You are impure.” The proof is from a bridegroom and festival (see Rashi 13:14). Similarly, a person that was certainly impure who was healed and developed the signs of purity only loses his @ITchazokoh@it of being impure by the word of the @ITkohein@it who tells him, “You are pure.” (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it). The same applies if he was pure and the @ITkohein@it declared him impure and erred, he will be pure. You need not ask: Why did Scripture not write this, which would be a greater novelty — that we are lenient and do not pay attention to that which the @ITkohein@it declared him impure? [The answer is:] It is obvious that immediately when the @ITkohein@it’s error in declaring him impure is discovered it will be as if the @ITkohein@it never said anything. Consequently, the person is pure. This is not so regarding someone who is truly impure and the @ITkohein@it erred to declare him pure, [it is not enough to say that it is as if the @ITkohein@it never said anything], for the @ITkohein@it needs to explicitly declare him impure, since any truly impure person is only impure when the @ITkohein@it declares him impure (@ITDivrei Dovid@it).<QC>
@p1[44]@p2<TIE>Other afflicted persons@bo. Meaning: I [know] only of @ITnesokin@it that require that “his garments shall have a tear in them and his hair<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” You might ask: Rashi should explain this on [the verse that follows:] “His garments shall have a tear in them.” The answer is: This is Rashi’s view: Do not think you should say [the phrase] “his skin-eruption is on his head” is extra, as [I might think since] the entire section speaks about the head. Perforce, it comes to include other types of afflicted persons. You cannot say this, because we only learn from “his skin-eruption is on his head” other afflicted persons that are [of the sort] of skin-eruptions of @ITnesokim@it, which resemble the baldness in back of the head or in front of the head, both of which are in the head — that his garments shall have a tear in them and all the rest of the laws of the impurity of baldness in back of the head or in front of the head, and that the @ITkohein@it shall declare them impure. From where [do I know] to include even the other afflicted persons with @ITtzora’as@it of the skin or flesh — that the ones afflicted with them shall tear their garments, their hair shall grow long, and the rest of the [matters] mentioned, and that the @ITkohein@it shall declare them impure? The Torah states: “@hh<HEB>טמא יטמאנו@ee<ENG> (shall surely declare him unclean),” a twice repeated verb, to include all of them. This is what Rashi concludes at the end: “Regarding all of them it says: ‘His clothes shall have a tear in them’” (@ITRe’m@it). @p1[45]@p2<TIE>[So that people] will keep away from him.@bo Not that he should call others impure as what seems to be understood from Scripture.<QC>
@p1[46]@p2<TIE>By his slanderous tongue, he separated@bo. For this reason he is called a @ITmetzoro@it — @hh<HEB>מוציא רע@ee<ENG> — one who slanders. @d1Beyond the three encampments@bo. Meaning: From that which is written: “He shall dwell alone,” which implies that even other impure persons, [such as] a @ITzov@it (one with a discharge) or impure person due to [defilement by] a corpse, should not sit with him. If so, perforce, “beyond the encampment” means beyond the three encampments, for an impure person from a corpse is permitted to be in the Levite camp but prohibited from the camp of the Shechinoh, and the @ITzov@it is prohibited in the Levite camp but permitted in the Israelite camp, as it is written (Bamidbar 5:3): “and they not cause impurity in their camps (@hh<HEB>מחניהם@ee<ENG>),” and it does not say “@hh<HEB>מחנם@ee<ENG>.” This implies you should give one camp to this one and one camp to that one; one camp for the impure person due to [defilement by a] a corpse, and one camp for the @ITzov@it. I will write more about this, God willing. @p1[48]@p2<TIE>Or of wool@bo. The @hh<HEB>ל@ee<ENG> is like the @hh<HEB>ל@ee<ENG> of (Bereishis 32:18): “@hh<HEB>למי אתה@ee<ENG>” which means: To whom do you belong?<QC>
@p1[51]@p2<TIE>Prickly@bo. Rashi explains: “As in the expression, ‘a prickly brier,’ which means a painful thorn. It is a verse in Yechezkel (28:24). Radak explains: A painful thorn, and the same appears in his @ITShoroshim@it. @p1[52]@p2<TIE>Of wool@bo. Not that the @hh<HEB>ב@ee<ENG> is instead of @hh<HEB>של@ee<ENG> (of), but rather instead of a @hh<HEB>מ@ee<ENG> (from), as in (8:32): “@hh<HEB>והנותר בבשר ובלחם@ee<ENG> (and the left over from the flesh and bread).” @d1To exclude.@bo And the @hh<HEB>ב@ee<ENG> is in its plain meaning, connected with the phrase, “he shall burn.”<QC>
@p1[54]@p2<TIE>The place of the eruption alone@bo. Meaning: [You might think] only the place of the eruption is required to be washed but not the garment in which there is the eruption. [Therefore] the verse says: “the article having the eruption<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @d1The verse says: “the eruption.”@bo Meaning: Later in this section it is written regarding the washing of an eruption (v. 56): “And behold! The eruption grew faint after it was washed,” which refers to the eruption. Meaning: We cannot say the place of the eruption alone, since it says, “the article having the eruption,” and we cannot say the entire garment, because it should say “they shall wash [it]” [and not mention the eruption]. Would we not know that the eruption is in the garment? (@ITGur Aryeh@it). @p1[55]@p2<TIE>It did not fade@bo. You should infer: Thus, if it did fade it is pure. [Its explanation is] not that it did not increase [from its appearance], and you would infer that if it increased it is pure or confined, for that is more severe than if it did not change its hue, which is impure (@ITRe’m@it).<QC>
@d1All the more so if it did not turn [color] but spread.@bo For spreading is more severe than not spreading, which is impure. @d1What should be done with it@bo. This is because it is not mentioned in any place if [the case where] it turned is more severe than [the case where] it did not turn, or not. @p1[56]@p2<TIE>And burn it.@bo Not that he should tear it alone, but rather he should also burn it. Even though burning was not mentioned [here,] it was already mentioned above (v. 55), and here it returns to explain the manner of burning — how it should be. Meaning: We cannot say the garment is just torn, for it is written, “from the garment.” (@ITGur Aryeh@it).
@p1[2]@p2<TIE>That we do not proclaim him pure at night@bo. You might ask: Why does Scripture need to write, “on the @ITday@it of his purification”? It is written elsewhere (7:38): “On the day that he commanded” — in the day but not at night. The answer is: If it did not write, “on the day of his purification,” I might think that since his sacrifice is different than any other sacrifice, in that it requires waving while [the animal is] alive (v. 12), then its law is different as well. Therefore, it needed [to say,] “on the day of his purification” (so I found).<QC>
@p1[3]@p2<TIE>Beyond the three camps@bo. You might ask: Why does Rashi need to explain this? He already explained this above regarding (13:46): “Beyond the encampment.” The answer is that he explains a second time here for the following reason: So that you will not say that since it is written, “he shall be brought to the @ITkohein@it,” it implies that the one who is afflicted with @ITtzora’as@it should go to one of the camps, and there the @ITkohein@it will examine him. Therefore, Rashi had to explain as he did, because it is written: “[The @ITkohein@it] shall go out beyond the encampment.” And that which it is written, “he shall be brought<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” does not refer to the one who is afflicted with @ITtzora’as@it, but rather to the purification [process] of the one who is afflicted with @ITtzora’as@it, i.e., [the means of] how the @ITmetzoro@it is purified from his @ITtzora’as@it is by him being brought to the @ITkohein@it. @p1[4]@p2<TIE>Excluding @HB<HEB>טריפות@ee<ENG>. Rashi is answering the question: Why does it say @hh<HEB>חיות@ee<ENG>? A bird is not a @hh<HEB>חיה@ee<ENG> (beast)! We cannot say that @hh<HEB>חיות@ee<ENG> means that they have to be alive and not dead, because it is written afterwards, “and he slaughters the one bird,” and it is written, “and send the live bird into the open field.” Rashi answers: “Excluding @hh<HEB>טריפות@ee<ENG>,” meaning: We require that they should be fit to be alive and not a @hh<HEB>טריפה@ee<ENG> because a @hh<HEB>טריפה@ee<ENG> cannot live. We need the exclusion for @hh<HEB>טריפות@ee<ENG> so that we will not say since it is not an offering, but rather it is slaughtered outside the encampment, @hh<HEB>טריפות@ee<ENG> would be acceptable for the @ITmetzoro@it’s purification. Thus, it lets us know [otherwise]. @d1Because@bo. Re’m writes: This implies that Rashi holds the view that the expression @hh<HEB>ציפרים@ee<ENG> does not refer to a pure bird, but rather it refers to [both] impure and pure [ones]. This raises a difficulty, because in (Chulin 139b) [the Rabbis] taught: “An impure bird is exempt from [the mitzvah of] sending [away the mother bird]. What is the source of this? Rabbi Yitzchak said: As it is written (Devarim 22:6): ‘If a bird’s nest (@hh<HEB>קן ציפור@ee<ENG>) chances before you on the road.’ — The expression @hh<HEB>עוף@ee<ENG> implies both impure and pure, [but] @hh<HEB>ציפור@ee<ENG> — we find that a pure bird is called [@hh<HEB>ציפור@ee<ENG>]; an impure [bird] is not called [@hh<HEB>ציפור@ee<ENG>], etc.” Thus, [the expression] @hh<HEB>ציפרים@ee<ENG> in Scripture refers to pure and not to impure. It appears to me that Rashi was aware of this difficulty and answered it with that which he wrote: “Because [these] eruptions come<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” [This poses] a difficulty: Why did he not explain this regarding “two birds,” but rather waited until here? It must be Rashi is coming to answer [the question:] Why does it say, “pure”? [The expression] @hh<HEB>ציפרים@ee<ENG> in Scripture refers to pure [ones]! Rashi answers: “Because, etc.” If so, hear from this that because of the chattering sounds he brings birds and not animals. If so, I might think that so much more so he should bring impure birds [which twitter and emit sounds more than pure birds, and that which it says in the verse @hh<HEB>ציפרים@ee<ENG> is not meant to exclude impure birds], but rather to include even pure birds, and so much more so impure [birds]. For this reason Scripture specified “pure.” Alternatively, the reason it is written, “@hh<HEB>ציפרים@ee<ENG>” is to indicate the twittering, because they twitter from the morning (@hh<HEB>צפרא@ee<ENG>), and @hh<HEB>ציפור@ee<ENG> (bird) is from the expression @hh<HEB>צפרא@ee<ENG> (morning), as Ramban writes. Nachalas Yaakov explains that Rashi is answering the question: Why does Scripture exclude impure? They are not offerings; but rather he slaughters it outside the encampment in an earthenware vessel! On this he answers that the pure species include birds that chatter incessantly with twittering sounds, which is not so regarding the impure species.<QC>
@d1For haughtiness@bo. This is why he needs to take cedarwood which is tall and the most beautiful of all the trees. You might ask: Scripture requires that he take cedarwood regarding @ITtzora’as@it of houses as well, but what haughtiness of spirit does a house have? The answer is: The @ITtzora’as@it that Hashem placed in houses was because the Emorites hid treasures in the walls of their houses, and therefore Hashem placed @ITtzora’as@it in the houses so that the Jews would need to break down the houses and thus they would find the [hidden] treasures, as Rashi explains later (14:34). And someone who has a lot of money becomes haughty of spirit, as it says in Parshas Eikev (Devarim 8:13): “And your herds and your flocks multiply<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” after which it is written: “And your heart grows haughty, and you forget, etc.” Therefore, Scripture requires him to take cedarwood, as if to say: Do not be haughty of spirit due to the large amount of money that [was hidden] in the house’s wall, which I gave you (@ITMahara’i@it). Above, Rashi explains: [Because eruptions come] for [the sin of] lashon hara! Both of them are one reason: One speaks lashon hara about others because of his haughtiness of the spirit, since they are not considered important at all in his eyes. You might ask: This explanation is valid for skin-eruptions on a person, but what will you say regarding eruptions in houses? There is no difficulty! The eruptions of houses come for the transgressions of people as well, as the Midrash says: The Merciful One does not afflict people first. Thus, all the eruptions are for the sake of a person’s atonement, because they come on account of him (@ITDivrei Dovid@it). @d1A stick@bo. This does not mean a cedar tree as the word @hh<HEB>עץ@ee<ENG> usually connotes, for how could he take the entire tree? @d1A strip (@HB<HEB>לשון@d1<ENG>).@bo I.e., the wool was long like a tongue (@hh<HEB>לשון@ee<ENG>) and dyed crimson. @p1[5]@p2<TIE>First in a vessel@bo. Because at first it is written, “in an earthenware vessel,” and afterwards it is written, “over running water.” How could that be? Rashi answers: Both are true: He [first] places [the water in a vessel]<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. @d1A fourth@bo. [Rashi knows this] from that which is written afterwards: “And immerse them and the live bird in the blood of the slaughtered bird<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” This implies that the blood should be recognizable in the water. @p1[6]@p2<TIE>That he does not tie it with them@bo. Rashi is answering the question: It should say “taking” once on all of them: “The [living] bird<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. [and the cedarwood, the crimson thread] and the hyssop he shall take them.” @d1Are wrapped together in the [crimson] strip@bo. I.e., the cedarwood and hyssop, and also the crimson strip are wrapped together in a bundle, but the crimson strip is not wrapped around the [other] two. Rather, it was wrapped with them in a bundle with the remnants of the strip. @d1It is not included in the [requirement] of dipping@bo. It appears to me that we should not explain that [Rashi means] it would not be included at all in [the requirement of] dipping, because Scripture writes: “and the live bird in the blood of the slaughtered bird.” Rather, it appears to me that this is what he means: Perhaps, just as it is not included in [the requirement of] tying together, but rather is taken by itself, so too it is not included in [the requirement of] dipping with the bundle. Instead, [it would have a] dipping by itself. [Therefore,] the verse says, “and he shall dip them and the live bird” — one dipping for all of them (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it).<QC>
@p1[8]@p2<TIE>That he is forbidden marital relations@bo. [Rashi knows this] because we derive “his tent” from “your tents” as it is written concerning Matan Torah (Devarim 5:27): “Go say to them, ‘Return to your tents’,” where marital relations were permitted to them. Meaning: We cannot say [it means] that he should not enter his home, because since he has entered the Israelite encampment why should he not enter his home? (@ITGur Aryeh@it).<QC>
@p1[9]@p2<TIE>Every place in which there is a collection of hair [which] is visible@bo. “He shall shave off all of his hair,” a general statement; “his head, his beard, and his eyebrows,” a statement of particulars; “he shall shave off all of his hair,” again a general statement. [This constitutes a] @hh<HEB>כלל ופרט וכלל@ee<ENG> — and you must judge only like the particulars [i.e., the general statement must conform to the particulars listed between the general statements in the verse]. Just as the particulars are clearly in a place where there is a collection of hair which is visible, so too every place in which there is a collection of hair which is visible, such as the mustache. This excludes the hair of the armpits or of the genitals that although it is a collection of hair, it is not visible. And it excludes the hair on the hands that although it is visible, it is not a collection of hair as [written in] the statement of particulars.<QC>
@p1[10]@p2<TIE>For a sin-offering@bo. One lamb came for a guilt-offering, as it is written (v. 12): “The @ITkohein@it shall take one lamb and bring it as a guilt-offering.” It did not specify anything, however, regarding the other lamb and the one ewe; it only states without specifying that one is for a burnt-offering and one is a sin-offering. However, the second lamb must be for the burnt-offering, because a female is not brought for a burnt offering, as it is written in Parshas Vayikra (1:3). Therefore, the ewe must be for the sin-offering (@ITRe’m@it). @d1Require drinkofferings@bo. I.e., [you might ask:] the other sinofferings and guilt-offerings do not require drink-offerings, as we derive (Menachos 91b) from Scripture: “For an expressed vow or for a voluntary offering” (Bamidbar 15:3) — that which comes as a vow or voluntary offering requires drink-offerings, but that which does not come as a vow or voluntary offering does not require drink-offerings. If so, I might think that these three tenths here are referring to a meal-offering that comes by itself, and not the meal-offerings of drink-offerings. [This cannot be,] for if so, it would require only one tenth for the burnt-offering. Therefore, Rashi needs to explain that they come for these three sheep. @d1And for placing on his thumbs@bo. Rashi wants to give a reason for this log: Why is it not mentioned in any one of the drink-offerings of animals? On this he explains: “To sprinkle<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (@ITRe’m@it). It appears that we can explain that Rashi is coming to explain so that we should not err to say that [this log] is for the oil of the meal-offering of drink-offerings. Concerning the difficulty raised by Re’m: How could we err to say [that this log is the oil that was mixed with the fine flour when it already says beforehand, “a meal-offering mixed with oil”?], etc. The answer is: This is what the verse says: “A meal-offering mixed with oil” — and how much oil does one [need to] mix with the meal-offering? — One log of oil. Therefore, Rashi needs to explain [what he does with the leftover oil]: “To sprinkle<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1[11]@p2<TIE>At the Nicanor Gate@bo. [This gate] was in the eastern section of the Courtyard and a person who stands there and faces the west sees the entrance to the Sanctuary, and that is “before Hashem.” The interior space of Nicanor Gate was not sanctified with the holiness of the Courtyard so that the @ITmetzoro@it, who was missing atonement could stand there in order to put his hand inside [the Courtyard], to sprinkle on him. This was because someone who is lacking atonement that enters the Courtyard is liable @ITkoreis@it. Therefore, the Sages did not sanctify it [the interior space of Nicanor Gate] with the holiness of the Courtyard. See Re’m. @p1[12]@p2<TIE>Into the [outer] court.@bo [Rashi knows this] because it is written in the next verse: “He shall slaughter the lamb,” which implies that it is still alive. Thus, how could [it mean] they bring it as an offering? Rather, [it must mean] they bring it into the outer court. Rashi gives the reason for this [in the next comment:] In order to wave it when it is alive because “it requires waving [while it is still] alive,” unlike the fats of the peace offering [that require waving after slaughtering], etc. @d1The guilt-offering and the log@bo. I.e., but [it does] not [refer to] the two lambs, the ewe, and the three tenths of the beginning of the section. Or, [perhaps] we should say that the lamb is not included in the waving, since the “bringing” refers especially to the lamb and the “waving” to the log. And why does it say “[he shall wave] @ITthem@it” which is the plural form? — To include the log and the tenths, but not the lamb. [Therefore, Rashi needs to say that even though “he shall bring it” refers specifically to the lamb,] nevertheless, since it is written afterwards, “and with the log of oil,” it is as if it says, “and he shall bring it and also the log of oil,” for both of them are included in this bringing. And when it repeats and says, “and he shall wave them,” it refers to the lamb and the log. Similarly, it is written explicitly regarding [the section] “If he is poor” [in v. 24]: “The @ITkohein@it shall take the [guilt-offering] sheep [and the log of oil and the @ITkohein@it shall wave them]” (@ITRe’m@it). @p1[13]@p2<TIE>To be subject to being placed@bo. You might ask: Why does Scripture not reveal with regard to the sin-offering and the burnt-offering that they too must be slaughtered in the north? They too departed from the general rule of sin-offerings and burnt-offerings to be subject to being placed [at the Nicanor Gate], as it is written (v. 11): “The @ITkohein@it shall place,” which refers to all the offerings needed by the one undergoing the purification. The answer is: Why would you think they do not need to be slaughtered in the north? With regard to the guilt-offering it is understandable that Scripture needs to reveal [that it must be slaughtered in the north], because a guilt-offering is different in that its blood has to be put on the thumb and the ear’s middle ridge of the man undergoing the purification. [Thus,] I might think that it is permitted to slaughter the guiltoffering in the place where the man undergoing the purification is standing, since the @ITkohein@it brings the blood there to put on his thumbs and the middle ridge of his ear. But with regard to the sin-offering and burnt-offering — no blood is needed there at all! @d1Has been made similar@bo. The meaning of, “regarding all the services which depend on the @ITkohein@it” is that just as with regard to the sin-offering the animal comes from unconsecrated [livestock], [it is offered] in the day, [the service is done] with the right hand, and it requires a [sacred] vessel, so too this guiltoffering. [But] it is not like a sin-offering to be given to the @ITkohein@it. @d1Above as a sin-offering@bo. Meaning: It is known that the height of the altar is ten amos, and in the middle of its height there was a red line around the altar to divide between the blood [placed] above and that [placed] below. Regarding the sin-offering it is written (4:25): “[The @ITkohein@it shall take some blood of the sin-offering with his finger and put it] atop the corners of the altar.” Perforce [the sin-offering is] of the [offerings whose blood is] put above. But, regarding the guilt-offering it is not is written “corners,” perforce its blood is [put] below. @d1The verse says, etc.@bo The verse says, “This is the teaching of the guilt-offering.” The word @hh<HEB>תורת@ee<ENG> always comes to include, so that the guilt-offering of the @ITmetzoro@it should have its blood placed below the red line, even though it is connected to the sin-offering pertaining to other matters. @p1[16]@p2<TIE>Toward the Holy of Holies@bo. Because now he is not lacking atonement and it is permitted for him to go to the Courtyard and within. Furthermore, this sprinkling is not at the Nicanor Gate, and so perforce this expression “before Hashem” means opposite the Holy of Holies. @p1[20]@p2<TIE>The meal offering [accompanying] the drink-offering@bo. I.e., that is brought with an animal, which is the meal-offering of a drinkoffering and not a meal-offering that is brought on its own, because the meal-offering that is brought on its own has a fistful taken and the remnant is eaten by the @ITkohanim@it. But this meal-offering is compared [through a @hh<HEB>היקש@ee<ENG>] to the burnt-offering which is entirely burnt, and so too, this meal-offering is entirely burnt.<QC>
@p1[21]@p2<TIE>One tenth as its drink-offering@bo. [Rashi is answering the difficulty] that it did not need to say “@ITone@it [tenth fine flour].” It is fine that it mentions “one lamb,” that is understandable, since a wealthy person brings three animals it emphasizes that the poor person [brings only] one. But regarding the tenth, we cannot say this, since the tenth is secondary to the animal it only needed to say “a tenth fine flour.” Therefore, we need to say that the explanation of the verse is: “One tenth (ephah) fine flour, for this lamb, which is a [single] one.” Accordingly, the word “one” is connected to “lamb” and refers to the word “one” written by the lamb (@ITGur Aryeh@it). Meaning: Rashi is answering the question: Why is it different from above where it requires three tenths but here one tenth? We cannot say because it decreased the [amount of] lambs, for this is fine [regarding] the lambs, because it requires in their place turtledoves or young pigeons, but nothing was required in place of the tenths at all. On this Rashi answers: Since the tenths are only brought only on account of the lambs and not for a meal-offering on their own, therefore, he brings only one tenth (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it). @d1The verse did not have to specify@bo. You might ask: Why did Rashi not explain this above (v. 10) concerning the three sin-offerings [i.e., the three animal sacrifices of the wealthy man], where it requires three tenths for three mealofferings? There, as well, it is not written how much oil is needed for the drink-offerings of the meal-offering! The answer is: From that which Rashi explains: “One tenth fine flour, for this lamb,” he wishes to prove what he explained above — that the @ITmetzoro@it’s sin-offering and guilt-offering require drink-offerings. This is in order that you will not ask: How does Rashi know? Perhaps the three tenths are for the drink-offerings of the burnt-offering alone, but the @ITmetzoro@it’s sin-offering and the guilt-offering are like the rest of the sin-offerings and guiltofferings that do not require drink-offerings. [Thus,] he explains: Regarding the poor man it says, “One tenth fine flour,” — “for this lamb, which is a [single] one,” he must bring @ITonly@it one tenth [as its drink-offering]. Consequently, it is impossible to say that regarding a wealthy man, three tenths [of flour] are for the burnt-offering alone, and there is nothing for the sin-offering and the guilt-offering. For if so, why does the poor man bring only one tenth? Since concerning the rich man everything depends on the animal, and he needs to bring three tenths for one animal, then concerning the poor man there should be three tenths as well. Rather, [it must be] as I explained: The @ITmetzoro@it’s sin-offering and guilt-offering require drink-offerings. If so, the remaining two [are distributed] one for the sin-offering and one for the guilt-offering. Rashi is answering the question: Because of his [i.e., the one being purified] poverty, should he not bring less oil as well. On this Rashi answers: [This amount of oil is necessary] to put on his thumbs, which includes sprinkling seven times, upon the [ear’s] middle ridge, and upon the head of the one being purified. Therefore, this log is needed in his poverty as well (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it). @p1[23]@p2<TIE>The eighth day from when the birds [were brought] and the sprinkling@bo. Rashi is answering the question: It implies that on this [day], the eighth day from when the birds were brought, he is pure, but this cannot be, for on the eighth day he brings the offerings and, perforce, he is not pure beforehand. Upon this Rashi explains: “The eighth day from [the day when] the birds [were brought]<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” and that day is also called purification from causing impurity due to lying down or sitting. You need not ask: How does Rashi know it is the eighth day from the sprinkling? Perhaps it refers to the day of bringing the burnt-offering, sin-offering, and guilt-offering. The answer is: Because it says above (v. 9): “It shall be, that on the seventh day, he shall shave off,” thus, it must be that “the eighth day” refers to [the day after] “the seventh day.” And even though above it also says (v. 10): “On the eighth day, he shall take two lambs<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” — and there Rashi does not explain anything — that is because earlier it is written (v. 8): “He must remain, outside of his tent, for seven days,” and [in the next verse] it is written: “It shall be, that on the seventh day,” and then immediately afterwards: “On the eighth day.” [Thus,] it must surely refer to what precedes it.<QC>
@p1[28]@p2<TIE>Even if it had been cleaned@bo. So much more so if the blood had not been cleaned, and you should not say if the blood is there it is an interfering factor between the oil and the thumb, [because] that it why it is written above (v. 17): “on [over] the blood of the guilt-offering.” And so the Gemora says in the first perek of Menachos (10a) (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it).<QC>
@p1[34]@p2<TIE>This is an announcement@bo. Otherwise, it should say: “When there will be.” Why does it say, “And I shall put”? You might ask: This [reason] is fine regarding the eruptions in houses, but what is the reason for the eruptions on clothing? The answer is: Because they did not know which garments were used for idolatry and the eruptions came in those garments, and they had to burn them (so I found). Some raise the difficulty: This [reason] is fine regarding a returning eruption, whose law is to tear down the house, however, with a non-returning eruption — what can we say [i.e., what is the reason for such eruptions]? Furthermore, some ask: The Gemora says (Erichin, 16a) that eruptions of the house come because of miserliness! It seems that one [question] is answered by the other. Certainly, the eruption of a house comes because of a transgression, but Hashem’s kindness makes it possible that sometimes goodness will come out of the punishment, which [in this case] is the hidden [treasures]. This is included in the language of the Sages: A goodness [resulting] from miserliness, and this is the announcement (@ITDivrei Dovid@it).<QC>
@p1[35]@p2<TIE>Something like an eruption@bo. The Torah teaches good character traits. A person should use an expression of doubt, as Chazal said (Berachos 4a): Teach your tongue to say, “I do not know.” And with this, Rashi is answering the question: At first it said, “I shall put the eruption of @ITtzora’as@it,” which implies that it is surely an eruption of @ITtzora’as@it in the eyes of the beholder. Why then does it say afterwards that he says: “@ITSomething like@it an eruption,” an expression of doubt? Rather, Scripture is teaching us that even if he is a learned man and knows for certain that it is an eruption that causes impurity, nonetheless, it is a Divine decree that he should only say an expression of doubt. Furthermore, Rashi is answering the question that according to the plain meaning I might think that it is a Divine mitzvah for the house-owner to come and declare this. However, this cannot be. Do you think that if the @ITkohein@it happens to be there, or if he did not say the expression — “something like an eruption” — it would not be fine? Therefore, Rashi lets us know that this is only a warning that one should not decide the matter with absolute clarity; but if he is completely silent [and says nothing pertaining to the eruption], that too is fine (@ITDivrei Dovid@it). @p1[36]@p2<TIE>And sees.@bo I.e., immediately when the @ITkohein@it sees the eruption everything in the house becomes impure, even if he does not tarry in the house the time it takes to eat a half a loaf [of bread]. Otherwise, what is Rashi coming to let us know? It is something that is obvious even to schoolchildren! @d1And with what was [the Torah] concerned@bo. This raises a difficulty: How does Rashi know that the Torah was concerned with earthenware vessels? Perhaps it is for silk garments or other things that if he were to immerse them [in a @ITmikveh@it] they would be ruined. The answer is: All the important [i.e., expensive] vessels are derived from what is written: “And they shall empty the house,” which is because of impurity. And if it comes to specify the reason explicitly it should [just] say: “so that which is in the house shall not become impure.” Why does it say, “everything”? Rather, this is to say he should empty the house even of objects that are not important [i.e., objects that are not expensive such as earthenware] (@ITKitzur Mizrachi@it in name of @ITPaneach Raza@it). @d1With earthenware vessels@bo. You might ask: Let us say that he should use them when he is impure, as we say regarding impure food, of which he eats when he is impure. The answer is: Food is different because it is eaten over a minimal period of time and we are not concerned about a stumbling block [i.e., he will eat when it is prohibited for him to do so]. However, regarding a vessel, which lasts a long time, we are concerned perhaps it will come to be a stumbling block — that he will use it on the days he is pure or it will come in contact with @ITterumoh@it or sacrifices (@ITDevek Tov@it). @p1[37]@p2<TIE>Sunken@bo. Re’m writes: This is very difficult in my eyes: If so, why does Scripture write afterwards: “And they appear to be lower than the [surface of] the wall”? Perhaps the answer is: Scripture itself is explaining itself what is the meaning of @hh<HEB>שקערורות@ee<ENG>.<QC>
@p1[40]@p2<TIE>As: “and she shall remove.”@bo I.e., the explanation of [the Targum] @hh<HEB>וישלפון@ee<ENG> is “he shall carry them away.” Afterwards, Rashi shows how Targum knows this explanation, and he says: “As [in the expression], ‘and she shall remove his shoe.’” However, Rashi is not able to explain that the @ITverse@it means: “he shall carry them away,” because how would he know that? However, I do not understand his words: Is it not explicitly stated in the verse: “And cast them away”? Also, there is another difficulty: Every place where Rashi explains, “according to its Targum,” [he means to say] the explanation is not like the Hebrew, but here the Hebrew too is the same, as in “@hh<HEB>וחלצה@ee<ENG> (and she shall remove)”! Thus, it appears that Rashi is answering the question: It should say @hh<HEB>וחָלצו@ee<ENG> with a @hh<HEB>קמ"ץ@ee<ENG> under the @hh<HEB>ח@ee<ENG>, as in @hh<HEB>וחלצה@ee<ENG>, and not with a @hh<HEB>חירי"ק@ee<ENG>, which is @hh<HEB>הפעיל@ee<ENG> (a causative verb form). This is because it is written, “The @ITkohein@it shall command,” so it should use @hh<HEB>ויפעלו@ee<ENG> (direct verb form) and not @hh<HEB>ויפעילו@ee<ENG> (causative). Therefore, Rashi brings the Targum @hh<HEB>וישלפון@ee<ENG>, and this completes the explanation. Furthermore, @hh<HEB>חילצו@ee<ENG> with a @hh<HEB>חירי"ק@ee<ENG> means ‘urging,’ but an expression of urging is not relevant here, therefore he brings the Targum (@ITRav Yaakov Trivash@it). @d1While they are still there@bo. However, if they are not there they do not cause impurity to the place, because the earth cannot acquire impurity. This is similar to the house afflicted with eruptions — anyone who enters it is impure because of the eruptions that are in the house. Similarly, as long as the stones with the eruptions are in their place they cause impurity to the place because of the eruptions that are in the stones (@ITGur Aryeh@it). @p1[41]@p2<TIE> From within@bo. @hh<HEB>מבית@ee<ENG> does not mean “from the house,” because it is missing the @hh<HEB>ה@ee<ENG> (@hh<HEB>מהבית@ee<ENG>). Also, it would not be understandable to say that he should scrape the house from the house. @d1Around the eruption@bo. Because we cannot say all around the house, from the four walls, for if so, why does it say, “all around”? It is already written, “He shall scrape the house from the inside”! @d1Wherein they scraped@bo. Because the word @hh<HEB>הקצו@ee<ENG> is of the form (Tehillim 106:33): “@hh<HEB>המרו את רוחו@ee<ENG> (They rebelled against His spirit),” and [since] the intention here is the scraping and not the border [i.e., edge], therefore, Rashi says it refers to that which they scraped within the border of the eruption all around. If it said, “@hh<HEB>אשר קצעו@ee<ENG> (which they scraped),” we would not know where that scraping is. @p1[43]@p2<TIE>An expression of something having been done@bo. Meaning: This is the passive conjugation (@hh<HEB>נפעל@ee<ENG>), and so too @hh<HEB>הטוח@ee<ENG>, because the @hh<HEB>ה@ee<ENG> has a @hh<HEB>חיריק@ee<ENG> it is an expression @hh<HEB>התפעל@ee<ENG> (reflexive), i.e., the house was scraped within the border of the eruption, “but [the phrase] @hh<HEB>חלץ את האבנים כו'@ee<TIE><ENG>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @d1Intense conjugation@bo. I.e., it is one of the stressed letters, therefore it is vowelized with a @hh<HEB>חירי"ק@ee<ENG>, as in @ITdibbeir@it (he spoke), @ITkippeir@it (he atoned). @p1[44]@p2<TIE>“And if the eruption returns.”@bo Meaning: The phrase “prickly @ITtzora’as@it” does not refer to “the @ITkohein@it shall come,” but rather to (v. 43): “If the eruption returns.” It is as if it says: “If the eruption returns” until “and after it was plastered” [skipping “the @ITkohein@it shall come and see and behold, the eruption has spread in the house”] “prickly @ITtzora’as@it is in the house, it is impure. He shall dismantle the house.” Then, [it returns to explain the laws of the confined house] (v. 46): “Whoever will come into the house<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” until (v. 47): “Whoever will eat inside the house shall wash his garments,” and afterwards [we go back to] (v. 44): “The @ITkohein@it shall come and see and behold! The eruption has spread,” he shall remove the stones, scrape, and plaster, “and the @ITkohein@it shall return” as above (v. 39) [as Rashi explains further on]. @d1And finds that it spread@bo. Meaning: The phrase, “[The @ITkohein@it shall come] and see; and behold! [The eruption] has spread” does not refer to [the case where it] returns and sprouts, because we derive @hh<HEB>ממארת@ee<ENG> through a @ITgezeiroh shovoh@it above (3:51) that even though it does not spread it is impure. If so, in [regard to] what is the verse speaking? If regarding [a case] where [the eruption] spread during the first [week], it was already mentioned (v. 39): “The @ITkohein@it shall return on the seventh day and shall see; and behold! The eruption has spread.” [It must be then that it speaks] only regarding the @ITkohein@it who comes at the end of the first week and found it unchanged in his sight and it spreads in the second [week]. [In this case] we derive “coming” from “returning” through a @ITgezeiroh shovoh,@it just as later [he removes the affected stones and] scrapes and plasters and gives it another week, so too here. And the verse (45), “and he shall dismantle the house” refers to (v. 43) “If the eruption returns and sprouts,” of which Scripture did not speak at all, and it explains here that it must be dismantled. However, if it remains unchanged in the first week and spreads in the second week, he removes the stones, scrapes, plasters, and gives it a week. @d1And gives it a week@bo. Meaning: I only know that he [removes the stones,] scrapes, plasters, and gives it a week; and if it returns and sprouts, he dismantles [the house] when it spreads at the end of the first week, because it had a spreading, and even if it remains unchanged in his eyes in the second week. Or, it was unchanged in the first week and spread in the second [week] he removes the stones, scrapes, and plasters. This is because we derive “coming” from “returning,” according to the aforementioned. However, where it is unchanged in his eyes during the first and second week — how do we know that even in this case he removes the stones, scrapes, plasters; and gives it a week, as in the case where there is a spreading? The verse says, “(@hh<HEB>ובא@ee<ENG>) he shall come,” and (v. 48): “(@hh<HEB>ואם בא יבא@ee<ENG>) and if he shall come he will come.” Meaning: It (v. 48) should say: @hh<HEB>ובא@ee<ENG>, why does it say: @hh<HEB>ואם בא יבא@ee<ENG>, twice? Perforce, it is to compare the two “comings” one to another: Just as regarding the first “coming” he removes the stones, etc. @d1If regarding [a case] where [the eruption] spread.@bo I.e.,@ee@BO@bo we have not yet determined from this verse that it refers to [a case] when it is unchanged in this and that [week]. Because of this Rashi says: “In [regard to] what is the verse speaking? If regarding [a case] where [the eruption] spread during the first [week],” and he did not remove the stones, and in the end, when he comes on the second week to remove the stones it spread, behold, [it was already mentioned] he must remove the stones, scrape, and plaster, even though it did not spread in the second [week]. This is because it says (v. 39): “The @ITkohein@it shall return on the seventh day<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” implying that since it spread [at the beginning], he must remove the stones even though it remained unchanged afterwards. If it spread in the second [week], and he did not remove the stones and it was unchanged in the third week, and then, at the end of the third week, he found that it remained in the area to which it spread the first time, i.e., the spreading of the second week, [this too, has been mentioned] that since it spread he must remove the stones, etc. This is because it says (v. 44): “The @ITkohein@it shall come and see; and behold! the eruption has spread,” which we established as referring to when it spread in the second [week], which implies he should remove the stones, etc. even though it is unchanged in the third [week]. @d1Thus, “he shall come,” “and if he shall come,” must deal<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo We@ee@BO@bo should not have in our text here, “he shall come,” “and if he shall come<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Rather, the correct text is: Thus, “and if he shall come,” must deal with [a case] in which [the @ITkohein@it] came at the end of the first week, even though it did not spread it is not pure. He confines the house and comes at the end of the second [week] and it did not spread. Even though it did not spread he removes the stones, etc. as Rashi explains in [the case where it is] unchanged. Re’m dwelt at length here but I shortened it. @p1[46]@p2<TIE>[But] not the days in which he scraped@bo. Meaning: All the days of confinement perforce the impurity is there, and therefore a person who enters is impure. However, the days [after] he removes the stones, scrapes, and plasters do not cause impurity to a person who enters since the impurity is gone, until he begins to count the weeks of confinement. This raises a difficulty: Why would you think that a [house that has been] declared [unclean] would be lenient, and a person who enters it would not become impure? [A house that has been] declared [unclean] is more severe than a confined [house], as it says in Toras Kohanim and the Mishnah (Negaim, 13:4): “A confined house causes impurity from the inside and a declared [unclean house causes impurity] from the inside and from the outside”! It appears to me the answer is: Only when the stones upon which the eruption returned are in the wall does it cause impurity, even from the outside. However, if he scraped the stones even though the house stands to be dismantled [I might think] it will not cause impurity to a person who enters during the intermediate days. Therefore, it lets us know: “Any of the days<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it). @d1Declared [unclean] which had been scraped@bo. This is a house in which the eruption sprouted after he removed the stones, scraped, and plastered. The eruption returned and sprouted, and its eruption was scraped and the stones with the eruption were taken out. [I might think] that someone who enters will not become impure, [therefore,] the verse says, “any of the days.” Scripture should have written: “In the days of its confinement,” why does it say, “any”? This is to include [a house that has been] declared [unclean], even though it has had its eruption scraped, it causes impurity. Since it is standing to be dismantled, the entire house is impure and it causes impurity to a person upon entering. @d1That it does not cause impurity to clothes@bo. Otherwise, Scripture should have written, “and he shall wash his garments and he shall be impure until the evening.” @d1As that in which one might eat half a loaf@bo. Meaning: The volume of four eggs. [You would assume that it does not] cause impurity to clothes because Scripture writes without specifying: “Whoever will come inside the house<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. shall be impure until the evening,” which implies even if he stays there the entire day it does not cause impurity to clothes. Rashi continues explaining: “The verse says: ‘Whoever will eat<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. ’” I.e., just as whoever will eat stays there and his clothes become impure, the same applies to what Scripture writes: “Whoever will come inside the house” as well — if he stays [the period of time] in which one might eat half a loaf, it will cause impurity to clothes although he does not eat. This is because we cannot say only eating [causes impurity to clothes], but one who lies down, in which only staying is applicable, does not [cause impurity to clothes], since the verse says: “Whoever will lie down.” This teaches that the reason that “whoever will eat” [causes impurity to clothes] is not because of eating. Rather, it is because he stays, and the same applies to coming inside as well — if he stays [the period of time] in which one might eat [half a loaf] it causes impurity. We cannot say that the verse means only eating or lying down [causes impurity to clothes], but if he did not lie down or eat, for instance, he only came inside, even though he stays [the period of time in which one might eat half a loaf] it does not cause impurity to clothes. [Because] if so, why does the verse say: “he must wash.<TIE>.<TIE>.he must wash” two times. Scripture should have written: “Whoever will lie down inside the house or whoever will eat inside the house shall wash his garments.” Rather, perforce, it includes a person who comes inside and stays although he does not eat or lie down, but [only] stays, causes impurity to clothes. Then, Rashi continues and asks: If so, that the matter depends on staying, why does it say, “whoever will lie down”? It is fine [that it says] “Whoever will eat”, [because] it is needed to give the minimal amount of staying — as the minimal amount of eating. [But why is “whoever will lie down” needed?] If it is because of the extra phrase “he must wash,” which includes even someone who only stays without eating or lying down, then Scripture should write “whoever will come inside” in place of “whoever will lie down,” since coming inside is included in lying down. Why does the verse say, “whoever will eat” and “whoever will lie down”? Rather, it is to teach that a minimal amount of time is necessary for one who lies down. Rashi explains this verse (46) after (v. 48): “If the @ITkohein@it shall come,” which is out of order, in order to juxtapose “If the @ITkohein@it shall come” with (v. 44): “The @ITkohein@it shall come and see,” because both are of one matter. Re’m dwelt at length but I made it short. Many raise the difficulty: Why is this different than a prohibition of eating, where the Torah prohibits an olive’s bulk? Why here is it the volume of four eggs? It appears to me that there is no difficulty at all: In all the other places Scripture does not intend to give the minimum amount, rather, it mentions the prohibition alone. However, we have established from a halachah of Moshe from Sinai [that the minimum amount is] an olive’s bulk. This is not the case here, where it intends to let us know the minimum amount. If it means to say as all the minimum measurements of all prohibitions — there is a prohibition in eating any amount at all, for example: something that is a living creature. Rather, it is referring to something that is the amount of a meal, which is the volume of four eggs (@ITDivrei Dovid@it). @p1[57]@p2<TIE>What day he is to declare [the house] pure.@bo The @hh<HEB>ב@ee<ENG> of @hh<HEB>ביום טהרתו@ee<ENG> is like the @hh<HEB>ב@ee<ENG> of “@hh<HEB>ובחרושת אבן למלאות ובחרושת עץ@ee<ENG> (to cut stones for setting, to carve wood)” (Shemos 31:5), which means with regard to cutting stone. The same applies here as well, Scripture instructs with regard to the day of becoming impure and the day of becoming pure. [However, in Toras Kohanim the Rabbis taught: This teaches that in the day he declares impure and in the day he declares pure], that is, during the day but not at night, because we do not declare impure nor do we declare pure at night. [Rashi did not use this explanation because he already explained (v. 2): “on the day of his purification” — “This teaches that we do not proclaim him pure at night.” Also, from the verse above (13:14): “On the day that healthy flesh appears on him” the Rabbis derived (Moed Katan 8a): “This teaches that we do not proclaim him impure at night.”] @p1[2]@p2<TIE>Perhaps [a discharge] flowing from anywhere@bo. Meaning: [I might think] even a flow from his mouth or nostrils or ears should be impure. @d1[The Torah] declared a male with a discharge unclean and a female with a discharge unclean@bo. If the verse did not distinguish, I might think that a [discharge] flowing from anywhere should be impure, even if it flows from the mouth or from the ear or from the nostrils. We cannot derive through a @ITgezeiroh shovoh@it from a female, because we can refute: What [special characteristic does] a female have [that causes the law]? Because she becomes impure as a @ITzovoh@it only through three sightings [of discharge] on three consecutive days to require seven clean [days] and an offering. However, three sightings on one day does not impart the law of @ITzovoh@it. A male, on the other hand, has the law of @ITzov@it even with three sightings on one day. If so, I might think [a discharge] flowing from anywhere would make him impure. However, now that the verse reveals: “@ITfrom@it his flesh” — and not all his flesh — that [a discharge] flowing from anywhere does not make a @ITzov@it impure, nevertheless, we do not yet know from which flesh a discharge flowing renders him impure and from which flesh a discharge flowing leaves him pure. [Therefore Rashi explains:] “I may argue<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @d1With a less severe impurity —@bo @hh<HEB>נדה@ee@BO<ENG>.@bo Rashi calls @hh<HEB>נדה@ee<ENG> a less severe impurity because it does not require seven clean [days] and an offering, which is not the case regarding @ITzovoh gedolah@it (a female who has had three sightings on three consecutive days), who requires seven clean [days] and an offering. @d1A drop [of discharge] that it causes impurity@bo. You might ask: This is obvious! The @ITzov@it becomes impure from that same drop of impurity with such a severe impurity that it causes impurity to people and vessels. Is it not more so that the drop [itself] causes impurity? The answer is: If Rashi did not explain I would have said that the drop does not cause impurity, because we can learn from the goat that is sent away — the one who deals with it becomes impure and causes impurity to others, but it itself is not impure. I might think that the same applies to a flow [of discharge], and therefore Rashi explains: “This teaches in regard to a drop<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @d1And dissolved@bo. @hh<HEB>ודחוי@ee<ENG> means thin. @d1To the white of an egg which is crushed.@bo Meaning: [An egg] from a hen that rubbed on the ground and not from a male. Rashi means to say that you should not be troubled: Since its impurity is so severe that even one drop of the @ITzov@it causes impurity, how will we know if one drop discharges from him? Perhaps it is a drop of semen and he is pure, or [perhaps] a @ITzov@it and he is impure. Upon this Rashi explains: “[This] discharge resembles water of dough<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1[3]@p2<TIE>And the third requires him [to bring] a sacrifice@bo. Meaning: If he sees the first sighting he is like someone who sees semen who only causes impurity [to another person] through touch, and with the second sighting he causes impurity also with carrying, lying down, sitting, and he must count seven clean [days]. Upon the third sighting he must also bring an offering, as it says in the first chapter of Megillah (8a): The only difference between the second sighting and the third sighting for a @ITzov@it, is the offering.<QC>
@p1[4]@p2<TIE>The verse says: “Upon which he lies.”@bo Meaning: For instance, a bakers’ plank or large kneading trough. @d1Get up so that we can do@bo. I.e., when it is being used for other work it is impossible that he could continue lying on it. @p1[5]@p2<TIE>Secondary source of uncleanness@bo. I.e., the bed that the @ITzov@it touches is a primary source of impurity, and it causes impurity to a person [who in turn] causes impurity to clothing that he is wearing, as it is written, “shall wash his garments and bathe in water.” However, something which is not specifically [used] for lying down and is touched by the @ITzov@it, is not a primary source of impurity. Rather, it is a secondary cause of impurity, which is only a first. When in contact with the @ITzov@it, the item causes impurity to a vessel which it touches that is purified by immersion; but it does not cause impurity to a person or earthenware vessels. After the @ITzov@it separates from it, the item only causes impurity to food or drink. The meaning of “more severe than touch” is [that it is more severe than touch that is] not [associated] with lying down. @p1[6]@p2<TIE>Even ten vessels one on another@bo. As it is written, “Whoever sits on the vessel that was sat upon by a @ITzov@it.” This makes a comparison between the sitting of the pure person and the sitting of the @ITzov@it: Just as the sitting of the @ITzov@it causes impurity to the vessels even though he does not sit on the vessel, such as the case of the “placed” stone (see later), so too is the sitting of the pure person who acquires impurity from the vessel which contracted impurity from the @ITzov@it, even if he does not touch it. A “placed” stone is a stone placed on pegs with vessels underneath it, as it is written (Daniel 6:18): “And a stone was brought and placed on the mouth of the pit.” If a menstruant woman or a @ITzov@it sit on it, even though their weight is not felt on the vessels, the vessels are impure, as it is written (v. 10): “Anything which is beneath him.” Rashi (Shabbos 82b). @d1And so [too] in regard to a bed@bo. [Rashi knows this] because we derive through a @hh<HEB>מה מצינו@ee<ENG> (comparison) from sitting. Meaning: If a pure person lies down on a “placed” stone (see above) and a @ITzov@it’s bed was underneath the stone, the pure person becomes impure even though the stone separates between them, and the stone does not acquire impurity; nonetheless, he is impure. Although it is written only regarding sitting, we derive lying down from it as well, since lying down and sitting are equal in their severity of touch, to cause impurity to clothing, [thus,] they are one matter. @p1[8]@p2<TIE>Because spittle causes uncleanness by means of carrying@bo. This is how it is derived: “If the @ITzov@it spits on a ritually clean person (@hh<HEB>בטהור@ee<ENG>),” and it is not written, “upon (@hh<HEB>על@ee<ENG>) the ritually clean person,” i.e., [he spits] on what is in the hand of the pure person, that is, if he spits on the staff that is in the pure person’s hand who is carrying it, he becomes impure. @p1[9]@p2<TIE>Even if he had not sat@bo. Meaning: He does not actually sit on it, which would be sitting mentioned in the verse (6). Rather, [this refers to] the side of the saddle, which is the wood in the front and back of the saddle that he does not sit upon, but rather the rider holds onto it so he will not slip forwards or backwards. Therefore, it is called the ‘hold,’ since he holds onto it. @p1[10]@p2<TIE>[Beneath] the @BIzov@bo. I.e., not beneath “anything used for riding” which is juxtaposed to this phrase. Rather, it refers to the @ITzov@it — that is, [a pure person who] touches the saddle that was underneath the @ITzov@it, becomes impure but he does not require washing clothes. @p1[11]@p2<TIE>As he did not immerse@bo. This refers to the @ITzov@it and not to the one who touches him, to teach that before he immerses he is impure and requires washing clothes. Otherwise, Scripture would only need to write, “If a @ITzov@it touches anyone, he shall wash his garments and bathe in water.” Why does it say, “And his hands were not rinsed”? Meaning: We cannot say it means literally “his hands,” literally, because it is written (v. 13): “and bathe his @ITbody@it in [running] water, and he will be purified” (@ITDivrei Dovid@it). @d1Hidden parts.@bo For instance: Inside his mouth, the opening of the male member below, or inside of body folds, which although the water does not enter there, he is pure. We only require that it should be fit for the water to enter. @p1[12]@p2<TIE>This is [when one] causes it to move@bo. Meaning: Its movement to and fro is caused entirely by the @ITzov@it’s power, because there is no [such thing as] partially moving, only entirely. The reason Scripture uses the expression “touching” for “moving” is to say that touching is compared to moving — just as touching is [accomplished] with his hands from outside, so too, moving is [accomplished] with his hands from outside — to exclude [the case of] a reed [held] in the @ITzov@it’s body folds. If there was a reed in his body folds and he moved a pure [object with it], it is pure, since the moving is caused only by his hidden parts. @p1[13]@p2<TIE>When he stops@bo. That is, the purity [cessation] of blood [i.e. discharge] and not the purity [cessation] of his impurity, for it is written afterwards: “and bathe in running water and he will be purified.” @d1That he not see@bo. Meaning: These seven days have to be pure from the impurity of discharge, otherwise, why does it say, “When a @ITzov@it will become ritually clean<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. he shall count for himself<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” which implies if it does not stop he does not count? If these days will not be pure from discharge, he has not stopped! Rashi continues to explain: “And all of them consecutive,” as it is written, “for his purification” — that his purification shall be as one. Meaning, he did not see a discharge in the middle, and if he saw in the middle, it disrupts the first days and he must begin to count another seven clean days.<QC>
@p1[18]@p2<TIE>Contact with one’s inner parts@bo. And contact with inner parts is pure even regarding a @ITzov@it. [This is because] from a @ITzov@it we learn that contact with inner parts does not cause impurity, from that which Scripture uses the expression “touching” in the case when the @ITzov@it moves something. We learn from here that all contact with inner parts does not cause impurity, because it is “a Royal decree.”<QC>
@p1[19]@p2<TIE>Only saw one sighting@bo. [This is] because “she shall be” is extra. This is what it means: “When a woman sees blood even one time, for seven days she will be in [the state of] her menstrual impurity.”<QC>
@p1[23]@p2<TIE>Even if he did not touch [it]@bo. This is as Rashi explains above (v. 6) regarding: “Whoever sits on the vessel” — “even if he did not touch [it].” Above (ibid.), I explained Rashi’s proofs that lying down and sitting cause impurity even though he does not touch the vessel. Rashi’s view is thus: Do not think that [the phrase] “when he touches @ITit@it he shall be impure until the evening,” which it says after [the phrase], “If he is on the bed<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” implies that even if he touches the bed, chair, or saddle he does not require washing clothes, and the explanation of the word “it” would be: “in each one of them.” This cannot be, for it does not refer to “If he is on the bed<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” This is because even if he does not touch it he requires washing clothes. We need not ask: To what does the phrase “when he touches it he shall be impure until the evening” refer? Therefore Rashi explains: “On the vessel — to include<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” I.e., why does it need to say, “on the vessel”? It only needs to say, “that she is sitting on.” Rather [it must be]: “To include a saddle.” If so, that which is written, “when he touches @ITit@it<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” refers to a saddle, as Rashi explains later that it does not require washing clothes. @p1[24]@p2<TIE>Perhaps he will join her in her state@bo. Meaning: For her sake, as in the expression (Shemos 11:8): “And all the people that follow you (@hh<HEB>ברגליך@ee<ENG>),” which means: that are drawn after you. [Perhaps] he will enter the days of her purity for her sake, i.e., straight away when she enters the days of purity he will immediately follow her. [Therefore,] the verse says<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. @p1[25]@p2<TIE>Three@bo. And so we learn in Toras Kohanim: Many days, three; or perhaps it means ten? It says “days” and it says “many.” The minimum number for [the plural] “days” is two; so too, the minimum number for [the adjective] “many” is three. Perhaps two and three equals five? But does it say “days @ITand@it many”? etc. We need not ask from the phrase “many days” regarding Yaakov where Scripture writes (Bereishis 37:34): “He mourned for his son for many days,” and Rashi explains it means twenty-two years. This is because regarding Yaakov, we cannot explain it means three days, for what would Scripture be informing us [by saying] that he wept for three days? Any man would mourn three days! Furthermore, regarding the laws of the Torah where it is written, “her [blood-]flow, many days,” and one must give a minimum amount for the matter. Otherwise, we would not know how many [days] constitutes a @ITzovoh@it, thus, one must explain there a minimum amount. And that is: If you hold onto the minimum amount you will take hold, but if you take hold of too much, you will lose everything, and that is the Torah’s measure. However, the verse, “He mourned for his son for many days,” only comes to tell us an excessive amount, and we do not need to know any minimum measurement — how many days, no more or no less. Scripture does not depart from its plain meaning (@ITGur Aryeh@it). @d1Seven days of her menstrual uncleanness@bo. Meaning: After the seven [days] she saw three consecutive days, then, she is a @ITzovoh@it and she requires seven clean days and a sacrifice. However, if she saw three consecutive days within the time of her menstrual impurity she is only a menstruant woman [and she counts seven days even if she sees during that time, and if she stopped seeing at the end of] seven she immerses and is permitted to have marital relations with her husband. She needs neither seven [clean days] nor a sacrifice. For this reason the verse needs to say, “Outside her menstrual cycle,” to teach this. The first section in which it is written, “When a woman has a discharge,” refers [to the case] when she saw one day or two days, where she is a @ITzovoh ketanoh@it (lesser @ITzovoh@it). Re’m writes: However, this raises a difficulty: Why did Rashi derive this teaching from the verse, “outside her menstrual cycle”? Why did he ignore the Beraisa in Toras Kohanim which derived this teaching from the phrase, “@ITafter@it her menstrual cycle”? However, I am astounded that the Rav missed what the Rabbis derived at the end of Maseches Nidah (73a), and Rashi’s words are explicit in the Talmud in Maseches Nidah, see there. @d1These three days@bo. I.e., it does not mean, “if [the discharge] flows” without specifying — even one day — because someone who has a flow of one day is not a @ITzovoh gedoloh@it but rather a @ITzovoh ketanoh,@it and she “keeps watch day by day.” In the evening she immerses herself and is permitted to have marital relations with her husband. Rashi mentions “these” as if to say: Those mentioned above. This is so that you will not ask: Why does the verse not specify? [The answer is] because they are mentioned above. @d1After@bo. We should not say “close to her menstrual cycle,” i.e., she never stopped seeing all the seven days of her menstrual cycle, and on the eighth day of her menstrual cycle she also saw. If so, she is still a menstruant woman, and she does not enter the category of a @ITzovoh@it until she stops [seeing completely] and becomes pure for at least one day. This demonstrates that she stopped seeing the menstrual blood and the source of the menstrual blood is closed. And from this point, another source [of blood] has been opened. Here as well, Re’m says that Rashi’s words originate in the Midrash of Toras Kohanim and he raised a difficulty (see there). However, Rashi’s comment originates from the Midrash Aggadah in Maseches Nidah (73a), and there it was expounded from the verse, “@ITOutside@it her menstrual cycle” — close to her menstrual cycle, and from the verse, “or if it flows @ITafter@it her menstrual cycle” — distant from her menstrual cycle. @d1For three@bo. Meaning: [Regarding] all the blood of a woman, from the day she has a regular monthly period until she dies or until her period changes to a different day, she counts seven [days] from the beginning of the day of her period, and then afterwards eleven days. And after them, seven [days], and thus the cycle repeats over and over again. All the blood she sees in those seven days is the blood of menstruation, and she sits seven days in her menstrual cycle, even if she saw only one day, and even if blood flowed freely all seven days of her menstrual cycle and stopped within the seven [days] before evening, she immerses and is permitted to have marital relations with her husband. She does not need [to count] seven clean days or [to bring] a sacrifice. All the blood she sees in the eleven days between one menstrual cycle and the next are the blood of zivah. The following is her law: If she sees one day or two days during those eleven days she “keeps watch day by day” and is only impure the day of the sighting alone. And the next day, if she does not see [blood] that entire day she immerses in the evening and is permitted to have marital relations with her husband. But if she sees three consecutive days in those eleven days then she needs [to count] seven clean days and [to bring] a sacrifice. @p1[31]@p2<TIE>Separation.@bo This is because the @hh<HEB>ז@ee<ENG> of @hh<HEB>והזרתם@ee<ENG> is stressed, bringing a @hh<HEB>נ@ee<ENG> before it, as if it is written, @hh<HEB>והנזרתם@ee<ENG>. Thus, the root of @hh<HEB>היזרתם@ee<ENG> is @hh<HEB>נזר@ee<ENG> (to abstain from). @d1One who causes impurity to the sanctuary is called “death@bo.” Rashi is answering the following question: here it mentions “death” regarding causing impurity to the Temple, but “death” connotes that he is cut off but his seed is not cut off, whereas @ITkoreis@it — he @ITand@it his seed are cut off. However, it is written in the beginning of Parshas Chukas that causing impurity to the Temple is punished by @ITkoreis@it! He answers: “Thus the ‘being cut off,’ etc.” Thus, “death” refers to, in general, death by the hands of Heaven, and [it includes] the particulars as well.<QC>
@p1[33]@p2<TIE>One who has had two sightings@bo. Rashi is answering the question: It compares a @ITzov@it to one who had a seminal emission (v. 32) to let us know that his impurity is only like that of one who had a seminal emission, which is impurity until the evening. But afterwards it is written: “For the menstruant woman during her period of separation<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” comparing him to a menstruant woman, whose impurity is more severe. On this Rashi explains that this refers to one who had two sightings, whose is impurity is more severe as explained above: One who has two sightings is compared to a menstruant woman who does not bring a sacrifice. By mentioning three [types of] persons with a discharge Scripture teaches that one who has had three sightings brings a sacrifice as well, as it is explained clearly in the section above (v. 14).<QC>
@p1[1]@p2<TIE>In a damp place.@p3 @hh<HEB>טחב@ee<ENG> refers to any place that cools or dampens [a person]. The explanation of the verses is as follows. Rashi is answering the question: Why does Scripture write, “And Adonoy spoke to Moshe” [and then repeat, “Adonoy spoke to Moshe.”] It should merely have written, “After the death [of two sons of Aharon] .<TIE>.<TIE>. Adonoy spoke to Moshe, Speak to your brother Aharon.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Alternatively, it should have written, “And Adonoy spoke to Moshe after the death [of two sons of Aharon].<TIE>.<TIE>. Speak to [your brother] Aharon.<TIE>.<TIE>. Why does it write [“And Adonoy spoke to Moshe,” and then repeat], “Adonoy spoke to Moshe.” Regarding this Rashi explains: “Why does the verse say [this].<TIE>.<TIE>.” He then cites the parable of Rabbi Elazar in order to say that the verse is like this parable.<TIE>.<TIE>. And thus, “This [second speaking to him clearly] urged him on more than the first one.” The verse, too, means the same when it is written, “And Adonoy spoke to Moshe” [and repeats it]. [The first time the verse says “And Adonoy spoke to Moshe], means [that He instructed] Moshe to only tell Aharon not to come into the Holy that is inside of the curtain and not to mention [that he can incur] death similar to the death of his sons. Afterwards, the verse writes “After the death .<TIE>.<TIE>. Adonoy said to Moshe.<TIE>.<TIE>.” meaning that the Holy One spoke again to Moshe to tell Aharon something else — he should warn him a second time to not come into the Holy, and [this time] also mention the death [of his sons] as it is written, “After the death of two sons of Aharon .<TIE>.<TIE>. Adonoy spoke to Moshe, Speak to your brother Aharon .<TIE>.<TIE>. so that he not die.” I.e., if you do not come into the Holy you will not die as your sons died, but if you come into the Holy as your sons did, you too will die like them. @ITRe’m’s@it text of Rashi is different, see there. Aharon’s sons did not die for entering the Holy of Holies, the place where Aharon was forbidden to enter at all times. If so, what proof does the death of his sons serve to support this warning? The verse means as follows: Aharon should not enter [the Holy of Holies] at all times in order not to die as his sons died when they entered a place forbidden to them. Similarly, he should not enter a place that is forbidden to him. (@ITKitzur Mizrachi@it) @p1[2]@p2<TIE>For if he enters, he dies.@p3 Rashi needs to say this. Because according to his explanation that the verses are a parable of two doctors, and that the second doctor gave a greater warning — so that you do not die in the way so and so died, you might ask that the verse only writes “that he not die,” and does not write that if he comes in he will die. Instead [it writes] that if he does not come in he will not die, which implies, the way his sons did not come in and did not die. Rashi answers that the words “that he not die” also hint that if he comes in he will die, because from the negative you infer the positive. @d1For I constantly appear.@p3 According to this explanation, @hh<HEB>כי@ee<ENG> is a reason for the above, the cause why the person who comes into the Holy dies. Thus the word @hh<HEB>כי@ee<ENG> here means “because,” like every @hh<HEB>כי@ee<ENG> in Scripture. And @hh<HEB>בענן@ee<ENG> means an actual cloud. Rashi explains further “For I constantly appear,” because the word @hh<HEB>אראה@ee<ENG> is [usually] in the future tense. Therefore Rashi explains @hh<HEB>אראה@ee<ENG> [here] as meaning “I appear” which is a present participle, since Hashem’s appearing in the future would not cause someone to die. @d1Except with the cloud of incense [on Yom Kippur].@p3 According to the explanation of our Rabbis [the Midrash], it seems that @hh<HEB>כי@ee<ENG> here means “except,” i.e., he shall not come to the Holy except with the cloud of incense on Yom Kippur, and [the verse calls it a cloud] because the smoke of the incense is like a cloud. This differs from the previous explanation where Rashi said it meant “a pillar of cloud,” i.e., that the Divine Presence rests inside. Rashi does not mean that he comes in from outside with the cloud of incense, as this is the opinion of the Sadducees. He is only excluding his earlier interpretation where he said it was the cloud where the Divine Presence resides. Regarding Rashi saying “on Yom Kippur,” Rashi himself soon explains that the whole section is talking about Yom Kippur.<QC>
@p1[3]@p2<TIE>Its [@HB<HEB>בזאת@BO<ENG>] @BIgematria@BO is 410.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Why does the verse say “with this”? You cannot say that it refers to the sacrifices mentioned afterwards because if so it should have said “With @ITthese@it Aharon shall come” in the plural form, since there were two sacrifices. Also, @hh<HEB>זאת@ee<ENG> is a feminine expression and the sacrifices mentioned afterwards are male [animals]. If so, the verse should not have said “with this” at all, but merely said, “For in a cloud I shall appear on the Ark-cover, and with a young bullock, for a sin-offering Aharon shall come.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Therefore, it must be hinting at the number of years that the First Temple stood. You might ask: Were there only @ITkohanim gadolim@it in the First Temple? Were there not @ITkohanim gadolim@it in the Second Temple as well? The answer is as follows: The @ITgematria@it of @hh<HEB>בזאת@ee<ENG> tells you how many years there would be @ITkohanim@it like Aharon [i.e., @ITkohanim gadolim@it] who were anointed with the anointing oil. After the First Temple, however, they no longer anointed them with anointing oil like Aharon, because at the end of the First Temple era the anointing oil was hidden away from the time of [King] Yoshia onwards, as Rashi explains later. @ITGur Aryeh@it asks: How do we know that one is warned against entering the Holy in the Second Temple? Perhaps this law only applies to the first Temple that stood this number of years? The Toras Kohanim answers as follows: “Why does v. 3 say ’into the Holy’? Did it not already say in v. 2 ’That he not come at all times into the Holy that is inside of the curtain.’ Why does it say ’into the Holy’ a second time? Because the verse said ’into the Holy that is inside of the curtain before the Ark-cover that is on the Ark.’ You might think that this only applies to a Holy [sanctuary] that has an ark. From where do we know that we make a Holy [sanctuary] without an ark the same as a Holy [sanctuary] that has an ark? Because the verse says ’into the Holy’ again.” You might ask: If so, why does the verse write @hh<HEB>בזאת@ee<ENG> to hint [at the years of the First Temple] if this prohibition applies in the Second Temple as well? Perhaps this teaches that if one enters the place of the Holy of Holies after its destruction one is not liable. Thus the verse refers to the First Temple as “into the Holy” to hint that one is liable because of its holiness, and therefore [entering] the Second Temple that is also holy [also] makes one liable. [But after its destruction one is not liable.] @d1But [only] on Yom Kippur.@p3 Even though Rashi already explained earlier regarding “for in a cloud I shall appear,” that this was on Yom Kippur, [Rashi repeats this] so that you should not say that only when there is only a cloud [of incense] may one may come in only on Yom Kippur. But if one brings a young bullock, for a sin-offering and a ram, for a burnt-offering one can come in even during other days of the year. Therefore Rashi explains here, “And this too, not at every time.” @p1[4]@p2<TIE>He does not perform the Service within etc.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: The Torah already mentioned wearing these garments in @ITparshas@it Ve’ata Tetzaveh? Therefore, he explains, “[This] tells us.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @d1But with four [garments] like an ordinary @BIkohein.@p3. Here too, it seems that he is answering the question: Why does it specifically write the garments of a regular @ITkohein@it? @d1That it should come from the Temple treasury.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Why does the verse write, “He shall don a sanctified.<TIE>.<TIE>.,” which implies that they are holy even before he wears them? What holiness can they have before he wears them? You cannot answer that he wore these garments on the previous Yom Kippur and this is speaking of a second Yom Kippur, because immediately after wearing them they need to be hidden away and the @ITkohein gadol@it never serves in them again as it is written (verse 23) “and place them there.” Therefore Rashi explains: “That it should come from the Temple treasury,” meaning he should buy them with money of the Temple treasury. Since we find that he buys the bull with his own [money], you might have thought that the garments too should be from his own [money]. Therefore the verse informs us [that this is not so]. The reason the bull comes from his own [money] is since it comes for [his personal] atonement as it says (verse 6), “And atone on his own behalf and on behalf of his household.” On the other hand, he prayed in the garments on behalf of all Israel. I found this. @d1He shall place [on his head].@p3 According to this, the @hh<HEB>ב'@ee<ENG> of @hh<HEB>ובמצנפת@ee<ENG> is superfluous, similar to the @hh<HEB>ב@ee<ENG> of @hh<HEB>ברוחו שמים שפרה@ee<ENG>, “His wind calmed the heavens” (Iyov 26:13), which is also superfluous. It is as if the verse said @hh<HEB>ומצנפת בד יצנוף@ee<ENG>. The @hh<HEB>בי"ת@ee<ENG> should be understood as a substitute for @hh<HEB>עם@ee<ENG> (with), as if it said, “With a linen turban he should wind around his head.” In the Targum too, @hh<HEB>ומצנפתא@ee<ENG> is without a @hh<HEB>ב@ee<ENG>. The Targum has to say this [translating @hh<HEB>יצנוף@ee<ENG> as “to put”] because the expression of @hh<HEB>צניפה@ee<ENG> does not exist in Aramaic. But in Scripture where we do find words like @hh<HEB>צנוף@ee<ENG> [and] @hh<HEB>יצנוף@ee<ENG> [which mean to surround], the @hh<HEB>ב@ee<ENG> has the meaning of @hh<HEB>עם@ee<ENG> (with) as in the phrase @hh<HEB>ובאבנט בד יחגור@ee<ENG>, “He shall gird himself with a linen sash.” Here too it means, “He shall surround his head with a (linen) turban.” Rashi cites the Targum to inform us that the expression @hh<HEB>צניפה@ee<ENG> refers to the head [only] and not to somewhere else. And incidental to this he explains that that @hh<HEB>יחית@ee<ENG> means “to place.” @d1He would change.@p3 The following is the order of the Services on Yom Kippur: First, he immersed and donned the golden garments for the daily morning sacrifice which is a Service outside. Afterwards he removed the golden garments and immersed, and donned the white garments to perform the Services of the bull and the goat and the incense of the hand shovel inside. Then he removed the white garments and immersed, and donned the golden garments to perform the Services of his ram and the ram of the people and some of the additional sacrifices outside. Afterwards he removed the golden garments and immersed, and donned the white garments and entered inside to remove the spoon and the hand shovel. Afterwards he removed the white garments, immersed, and donned the golden garments to perform the Services outside, to sacrifice the remaining additional sacrifices and the daily sacrifice of the evening and the [daily evening] incense. Analyze this and you will find it so. As Rashi explains later on v.<TIE>24, “He shall wash his flesh in water,” this (v. 4) indicates that he has to immerse before donning the white garments, and later (in v. 24) too it is written that he had to immerse before donning the golden garments. Therefore, we say that he must immerse whenever he changes from the golden garments to white garments or from the white garments to the golden garments. Rashi also explains that he requires two sanctifications, because verses 23 and 24 write “he shall wash” between “and remove” and “and don.” [“Aharon will then come into the Tent of Meeting @ITand remove@it the linen garments that he wore.<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. @ITHe shall wash@it his flesh in water in a sacred place @ITand don@it his garments.”] This is to apply washing to both the removing [his garments] and the donning [his garments], and if it is not to teach immersion which we have already learnt [from other sources], we use it to teach sanctification. @p1[6]@p2<TIE>And not from public [funds].@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Why does it say “which is his,” if no other bull is mentioned in this @ITparsha@it except that of Aharon as it is written, “With this Aharon shall come.<TIE>.<TIE>. with a young bullock?” [He answers]: This indicates that he must bring the sacrifices from his [property]. In addition, since it is written above, “He shall take, from the congregation of Israel two he-goats etc.,” it indicates that the sacrifices written above he brought for himself [i.e., with his own funds]. @d1He confesses over it.@p3 [Rashi says this] since it is impossible to say that this means actual atonement, as there is no atonement until after throwing of the blood as it is written below (verse18), “[He shall go out to the altar that is before Adonoy] and atone on it. He shall take some of the bullock’s blood [and some of the he-goat’s blood] and put it atop the corners of the altar, [all around].” But [here] this animal is still alive because afterwards (verse 11) it is written “And he shall slaughter his sin-offeringbullock.” Therefore, we learn from @hh<HEB>לכפר עליו@ee<ENG>, that it means “to achieve atonement with it” (verse 10), and [just as the atonement there is through confession, here too] it means through confession. I found this. @p1[8]@p2<TIE>One to his right and one to his left.@p3 [Rashi adds this comment] because it is written, “Aharon shall put lots on the two he-goats,” indicating that he places lots on both of them with one act of placement, and this is impossible unless one is in the right hand and one in the left hand.<QC>
@d1A high cliff.@p3 Azazel connotes both [strength and power] as it is a compound word @hh<HEB>עזז אל@ee<ENG> (strength, power), and @hh<HEB>אל@ee<ENG> connotes power as in the verse (Yechezkel 17:23), “And he took away the powerful (@hh<HEB>אילי@ee<ENG>) of the land.” Rashi explains further: How do we know it was a mountain? Because it says “A land cut off (@hh<HEB>גזירה@ee<ENG>),” and @hh<HEB>גזירה@ee<ENG> connotes “cut off.” [This indicates a mountain] because if one cuts a trench in the earth, a mountain automatically results, since for someone standing in the trench it is the same as standing in the valley of a mountain. @p1[9]@p2<TIE>“A sin-offering.”@p3 I.e., “And do (offer) it as a sin-offering” means “he calls it a name.<TIE>.<TIE>. ‘a sin offering.’” You might ask: How does Rashi know this? Perhaps it means that he sacrifices it for the sake of a sin-offering, as is indeed the law of a sin-offering? The answer is: Later in the @ITparsha@it (verse 15) it is written, “He shall slaughter the he-goat sin-offering,” which implies that he had not yet sacrificed it. @p1[10]@p2<TIE>Why does the verse say [this]?@p3 Explanation: because it [already] said @hh<HEB>יעמד@ee<ENG>, “it shall stand,” and “standing” implies that it is alive. If so, why does the verse say “alive?” @d1That he shall confess over it.@p3 But not atonement of blood, because this goat was not sacrificed and its blood is not received [in a vessel], as it is sent to Azazel. In addition, this cannot be [referring to the] blood atonement [of his bullock], because his bullock was not yet slaughtered.<QC>
@p1[11]@p2<TIE>And his brother @BIkohanim.@p3 You might ask: Why does Aharon not atone for his brother @ITkohanim@it with the first confession that he confesses on his behalf and on behalf of his household? The answer is: Because it is written, @hh<HEB>התקוששו וקשו@ee<ENG> (Tzephanya 2:1). [Although this actually means, “Gather yourselves together, gather yourselves], Reish Lakish said, [read the word @hh<HEB>התקוששו@ee<ENG> as @hh<HEB>התקושטו@ee<ENG> and say,] @hh<HEB>קשוט לעצמך ואח"כ קשוט אחרים@ee<ENG>, “Ornament yourself before ornamenting others.” Therefore, Aharon first confesses only on his behalf and on behalf of his household, and afterwards, during the second confession, he confesses also on behalf of his brothers. And the word “his household” [in this verse] also refers to his brothers as it says, “House of Aharon.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @ITGur Aryeh@it asks: Why does Aharon have to atone for himself twice? He answers: [to atone] for a sin that occurred between the first confession and the second confession, as @ITChazal@it say, it would be fitting for Israel to offer their sacrifices every hour, except that Scripture had mercy on them. Therefore, here where he anyhow has to confess for his brothers the @ITkohanim@it, he again confesses his own sins. Also, because the bullock belongs only to him, it is not fitting that he confess over it only on behalf of the [other] @ITkohanim,@it but rather they are subsidiary to Aharon as [belonging to] “the house of Aharon.” Therefore, in the second confession he once again confesses, “I and my household, the @ITkohanim,@it” who are subsidiary to Aharon. @d1Impurity to the Temple.@p3 With this, he also wants to prove that when it is written “and on behalf of his household,” it refers to his brothers the @ITkohanim.@it Because its whole atonement is only for impurity to the Temple and its holy things, therefore all the @ITkohanim@it need atonement for this. @p1[12]@p2<TIE>The outer [one].@p3 Because it is written “From atop the altar, which is before Adonoy,” and Rashi explains, “From the side [of the altar that is] before the entrance [to the Sanctuary], and that is before Adonoy.” Perforce, this must be the outer altar, because if it is the inner altar, how can it say “before Adonoy,” which implies the side [of the altar] that is before Hashem? The entire inner altar is before Hashem! Rather, it is the outer altar, whose western side is opposite the eastern side of the Temple, where the Temple entrance is located, and which is called before [Hashem]. @p1[13]@p2<TIE>Which is within [the incense-pan].@p3 [Rashi says this] to preclude explaining that there was another fire “before Adonoy” onto which he put the incense. Therefore he explains that he places the incense “’on the fire’ which is within the incense-pan.” “Before Adonoy” means [that he put the incense on the fire] inside [the Holy of Holies] and not outside like the opinion of the Sadducees. @d1If he did not do it properly.@p3 I.e., he did not put in all its ingredients according to their weight. Even if he did not do like the Sadducees, but placed the incense on the fire within the incense-pan after entering, even so, if he omitted some of its ingredients, either the ingredients themselves or [part of] their weight, he is liable for death. Rashi writes, “If he did not do it properly.<TIE>.<TIE>.,” since it is obvious that from the negative, one can infer the positive. @p1[14]@p2<TIE>One.@p3 Rashi does not mean that word “he shall sprinkle” implies once, because “he shall sprinkle” does not indicate once or more. Rather, he means that “he shall sprinkle with his finger” implies one sprinkling because of a @ITgezeirah shavah.@it It says [that] “blood” [is sprinkled] below [=downwards] by the he-goat (verse 15) and it says [that] “blood” [is sprinkled] below [=downwards] by the bullock [in our verse]. Just as [the sprinklings] below by the bullock are seven, so too [the sprinklings below] by the he-goat are seven. And just as [the sprinklings] above [=upwards] by the he-goat are once as it is written, “He shall sprinkle @ITit@it,” and @ITChazal @itexpound “it” as exclusionary, he should sprinkle it once and no more, so we learn that the blood of the he-goat [sprinkled] above [=upwards] on the Ark-cover is only once, so too the sprinkling of the bullock above is [only] once, because “blood, blood” is a @ITgezeirah shavah. Re’m@it @p1[15]@p2<TIE>The goat atones.@p3 I.e., just as the bullock atones for impurity of the Temple and its holy things for the @ITkohanim@it as Rashi just explained above, similarly the he-goat of the public atones for the impurity of the Temple. Rashi is [actually] saying [the reverse]: You might ask: Why does the verse write “that belongs to the people” since there is no he-goat sin-offering that does not belong to the people? This comes to teach you, what does the bullock atone for on behalf of the @ITkohanim@it? That same thing which the he-goat of the people atones for. The he-goat of the people certainly atones for the impurity of the Temple as it is written regarding it, “He will atone for the Sanctuary, from the impurities of Bnei Yisroel,” so the bullock of the @ITkohanim @itatones for the impurity of the Temple. [See @ITRe’m@it] @d1One above and seven below.@p3 Explanation: Rashi needs to explain this so that we do not learn the first instance of “blood” [in verse 14] from the last instance [of “blood” in verse 14] and the last instance [of “blood” in verse 15] from the first instance [of “blood” in verse 15], and say that the above [sprinkling] and below [sprinkling] of both the bullock and the he-goat] should be the same, or one [sprinkling above and below for the he-goat] or seven [sprinklings above and below for the bullock]. We would learn each case from itself. Therefore “just as he did with the bullock’s blood” tells us that we compare the he-goat to the bullock in all its actions, [and both of their numbers of sprinklings are equal]. [See @ITRe’m@it verse 14] @p1[16]@p2<TIE>In [a state of] impurity.@p3 Explanation: For being in impurity and inadvertently entering the Sanctuary or [eating] its sanctified items. However, [the verse is] not [speaking about] the impurity of idolatry or promiscuity or murder which are also called impurity. This is because it is written, “He will atone for the Sanctuary.” This indicates that it is speaking about the impurity of the Sanctuary and its sanctified things. See the Gemara, first chapter of Shavuos (7b), where this is explained well. @d1[Which] was not known to them afterwards.@bo Because if it was known afterwards, why does the verse command to bring a he-goat? Above in @ITparshas@it Vayikra (4:13,14) it is written, “If the entire congregation of Yisroel erred .<TIE>.<TIE>. [when] they realize the sin which they committed, the community shall bring a young bullock as a sin-offering.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Thus here we must say that it was completely inadvertent [and they did not realize even afterwards]. Therefore they bring a he-goat and not a bullock. This sacrifice is brought to suspend and to shield [in the meantime] from punishment, until the person realizes [that he sinned] and is then obligated to bring a sliding-scale sacrifice described in @ITparshas@it Vayikra. @d1And a transgression is unintentional.@p3 And so it says (above 4:2), “If a person unwittingly transgresses (@hh<HEB>תחטא@ee<ENG>).” “@hh<HEB>ומפשעיהם@ee<ENG>, are rebellious sins,” i.e., deliberate sins, as it says, (Melachim II 3:7), “The king of Moav rebelled (@hh<HEB>פשע@ee<ENG>) against me.” Here too, the case is that afterwards they do not know that they sinned. @d1Even intentionally entering in [a state of] impurity.@p3 You might ask: If intentional sin requires atonement, how much more so do intentional sins [require atonement]. The answer is: You may have thought that the severe intentional sin is severe that it is never atoned. Therefore it says “and from their rebellious sins.” You might ask: Once the verse has to mention intentional sin, it should not mention unintentional sin. The answer is: You might have thought that [only] an intentional sin which is severe requires atonement, but an unintentional sin which is not severe does not require atonement. @d1Just as he sprinkled.@p3 (@ITGur Aryeh@it) You might ask: Seven below and one above is not written in the he-goat itself but is derived from the bullock, and regarding sacrifices we do not derive a derivation from a derivation. The Gemara in chapter @ITHotzi’u Lo@it asked this question and answered that this is not a derivation from a derivation because “above” and “below” are written both for the bullock and for the he-goat, except that the number [one above and seven below] is not written explicitly [for both] and we derive the number from their comparison to each other; this is not called a derivation from a derivation but only a revelation of how many sprinklings must be made [see @ITRe’m@it]. @ITNachalas Yaakov@it explains [why Rashi stresses “just as he sprinkled of the two of @ITthem@it. This is] so that you should not explain that “he shall do likewise” teaches that he has to sacrifice another bullock and he-goat; therefore, Rashi tells us that they are the same two mentioned above. @p1[18]@p2<TIE>And why does Scripture state: “And he shall go out”?@bo Rashi means: before this Aharon was [already] at [i.e. outside] the curtain where he made the sprinklings. But then it is written “and he shall go out” which implies that [only now] does he go outside of the curtain? Rashi explains that regarding this too, it is appropriate to say “he shall go out,” because he was at the curtain which is further inside than the altar. Therefore, when he returns to the altar it is appropriate to say “he shall go out.” When Rashi explains that he “begins with the northeastern corner,” he means as follows: When he wanted to sprinkle he would turn his face towards the altar and his right hand would be towards the north. He [then] walked along the north side of the altar because, as they say, all turnings that you make should only be to the right. Therefore when he returned [to the exit, going] outwards [without sprinkling on the northwestern corner of the altar because the verse says “he shall go out”], he went along the [altar’s] north side until he reached the front of the altar that faces east. From there he immediately began [sprinkling] on the northeastern corner because one may not pass over mitzvos. @d1Some of the bullock’s blood.@p3 You cannot say that this refers to confession because it is already written above (verse 17), “He shall atone on his behalf,” which refers to confession, which is atonement of words, as explained above (Rashi verse 6). If so, his atonement [here] is that “he shall take some of the bullock’s blood.<TIE>.<TIE>.” It is as if Rashi said, “’And atone on it.’ What is his atonement? ’And he shall take some of the bullock’s blood.’” @d1Mixed together.@p3 Because it is written at the end of @ITparshas@it Tetzaveh (Shemos 30:10), “Aharon shall make atonement on its horn-like elevations once each year.” This implies that he only placed [blood] on the horns of the inner altar once each year. If so, if they were not mixed together and he put on each one by itself, the blood of the bullock and then the blood of the he-goat, the blood would be placed on the horns of the inner altar twice every year? Thus we must say that he put them on with one act. How? They are two bloods, the blood of the bullock and the blood of the he-goat? Therefore [we must say] they were mixed together. @p1[19]@p2<TIE>He sprinkles seven sprinklings on its top.@p3 Because it is written “on it,” implying that he placed [the blood] on its roof. @d1From what has passed.@p3 Explanation: “And purify it” from the impurity that has passed, “and sanctify it,” to be careful from making it impure in the future.<QC>
@p1[21]@p2<TIE>Who is prepared.@p3 The Toras Kohanim says: @hh<HEB>עתי@ee<ENG>, that he should be prepared. Radak’s explanation for the root @hh<HEB>עת@ee<ENG>, says that he is called @hh<HEB>עתי@ee<ENG> because he was accustomed in going there many times (@hh<HEB>עתים@ee<ENG>). @p1[23]@p2<TIE>This is not the [proper] place.@p3 [I.e., verse 23 and 24 are written in the wrong order. The @ITkohein gadol@it first burns his ram and the people’s ram as burnt-offerings (verse 24); afterwards he goes into the Sanctuary to remove the spoon and incense-pan (verse 23)]. In @ITmaseches @itYoma 32a [the Gemara asks]: Why does he interrupt, [by burning the rams before removing the spoon and incense-pan]? Said Rav Chisda, we have a tradition that he immerse five times and makes ten sanctifications on that day. [He makes one immersion and two sanctifications every time he changes into the white or the golden garments]. But if the verses are in order we would only find three [immersions]. Rashi explains: “You would only find three immersions, one [when he dons golden garments] for the morning perpetual offering, and one between it and the whole service of the day including taking out the spoon and incense-pan (verse 23) [when he dons white garments], and one between the taking out of the spoon and incensepan, and his ram and the ram of the people (verse 24), and with them the additional sacrifices and the perpetual-offering of the afternoon [when he dons golden garments]. Therefore, his ram and the ram of the people have to interrupt between the service of the day and the taking out of the spoon and incense-pan [in order to require an extra immersion]. And the taking out of the spoon and incense-pan interrupts between his ram and the ram of the people, and [the additional sacrifices] and the perpetual-offering of the afternoon [in order to require yet another immersion]. Thus we [now] have five immersions [prior to donning garments]. The morning daily sacrifice in the golden garments, the service of the day in the white garments, his ram and the people’s ram on the outside altar in the golden garments, taking out the spoon and incense-pan in the white garments, and the additional sacrifices and the perpetual-offering in the golden garments.” Between each donning [of garments] he needs to immerse; therefore there are five immersions. And every immersion requires sanctification before it and after it as I explained above, so that there are ten sanctifications. @d1Hidden away.@p3 Explanation: So that a @ITkohein gadol@it should not use them even for the next Yom Kippur, and so that a regular @ITkohein@it should not use them all the days of the year. You cannot say that he should place them in the place he removed them [from himself] and not take them outside, because nowhere does it say “before Hashem,” to which “place them there” would be referring to [and saying that they must not be removed from “before Hashem”]. Therefore, “[This] teaches.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1[24]@p2<TIE>And here we have learned.@p3 Explanation: [To know] the reason we need them both (see Yuma 32b). (@ITGur Aryeh@it) The Gemara there asks as follows. The verse should not write that he requires immersion when changing from the white to the golden garments because this can be derived by a @ITkal vachomer.@it If [changing] from the white garments to the golden garments, whose sanctity is less severe as he does enter the Holy of Holies with them, requires immersion, so then certainly that [changing] from the golden garments to the white garments whose sanctity is more severe requires immersion? The Gemara answers that the golden garments [have a superiority in that] their atonement is greater the entire year. But the white garments whose atonement is not great [the entire year], I would say [one does] not [require immersion]. Therefore both [verses] are needed. @d1In the roof of the Parva House.@p3 Rashi on the Gemara explains, “A Persian magician built it and his name was Parva.” See the Aruch, in the entry for @ITparva@it. @d1In common [space].@p3 @ITRe’m@it. It was in common [space] because every day too it is thus. But regarding the four immersions which are on account of the obligation of the day [i.e., Yom Kippur] it is written “in a holy place.” @d1In which he performs the Service.@p3 Not his [daily] clothes that he wears the rest of the year when not performing the service, which are common clothes, because he sacrifices his ram and the people’s ram in them. Therefore Rashi explains that they are holy clothes, and they are called “his clothes” because he wears them when performs the service the rest of the year. @d1And one ram, etc.@p3 @ITRe’m@it writes: It is surprising that he needs to explain something as obvious as this.<TIE>.<TIE>. The answer is: “Rashi explained [just before], “’And do (offer) his burnt-offering,’ refers to the ram for the burnt-offering mentioned above.” Thus Rashi is teaching: Just as the burnt offering of Aharon was the ram mentioned above [in verse 3], since Aharon only sacrificed one burnt offering [for himself], so too “and the people’s burnt-offering” means the one mentioned above [in verse 5]. And this is meant to exclude [that the verse here is not referring to] the burnt-offerings written in @ITparshas@it Pinchas (Bamidbar 59:7,8), “On the tenth day of this seventh month.<TIE>.<TIE>. you shall bring a burntoffering [for a pleasing aroma to Adonoy, consisting of] one young bull.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Rashi’s proof for this is that the verse groups them as one and does not write, “He shall go out and do his burnt-offering and atone on his behalf, and do the people’s burntoffering and atone on behalf of the people.” This is to tell you that the burnt-offering of the people too refers to the one mentioned above, like the burnt offering of Aharon, and not the burnt-offerings mentioned in @ITparshas@it Pinchas.” (@ITRe’m@it) @p1[25]@p2<TIE>The bullock and goat.@p3 Because if it was [referring to] the entrails of only the bullock burnt-offering or only the goat, which is the sacrifice of the people, it should have written, “the fat of the sin-offering of the people.” Or, if it was referring only to the bullock of Aharon, it should have written, “the fat of the burnt-offering which is his,” as Scripture writes above (verse 6), “the sin-offering bullock which is his.” Therefore, because it is simply written “the fat of the sin-offering,” it refers to both sin-offerings. @p1[27]@p2<TIE>And within.@bo Not like every sin-offering “whose blood is to be brought inside the Tent of Meeting to achieve atonement,” i.e., [it is brought]only into the Sanctuary and not within the Holy of Holies. Here however, it refers to the bullock of Yom Kippur whose blood is brought into the Sanctuary within [the Holy of Holies]. @p1[32]@p2<TIE>Except [when carried out] by a @BIKohein Gadol@BO.@p3 Explanation: “who himself will be anointed” applies only to a @ITKohein Gadol@it because it is written later (21:10), “The @ITkohein@it who is greatest among his brethren [upon whose head was poured the anointing oil].”<QC>
@d1One distinguished @BIonly@BO by the greater number of garments from where?@p3 You might ask: If so, the verse should not say “who himself will be anointed,” and I would say that if even someone distinguished only by the greater number of garments becomes a @ITKohein Gadol,@it how much more so someone anointed with the anointing oil? The answer is: I would then say that even when anointing oil is available one only has to distinguish him by the greater number of garments; so it tells us [that this is not so]. @d1And who will be initiated.@p3 Explanation: Wearing of clothes is initiation as it is written in @ITparshas@it Tetzaveh 28:8, 9), “.<TIE>.<TIE>.And clothe them [with undershirts]. Gird them etc. Thus you shall initiate Aharon and his sons.” And Rashi explains, “’Thus you shall initiate,’ by means of [following] these things [enumerated here].” @d1He has precedence.@p3 [The son must be capable of fulfilling his father’s place] because it is adjacently written, “And who will be initiated,” [lit. “whose hand is filled”], meaning, “He who fills his father’s place will serve in his stead.” Even though Rashi above expounded this for something else, nevertheless, because it is adjacent to “to serve in his father’s stead,” it comes to teach this as well. [see @ITRe’m@it] @p1[34]@p2<TIE>When Yom Kippur arrived.@p3 He did not do this immediately after the command, because Aharon’s sons died on the eighth day of the inauguration and the command was probably immediately afterwards so that Aharon should not enter the Sanctuary [Holy of Holies]. But the eighth day of inauguration was on Rosh Chodesh Nissan as Rashi explains at the beginning of @ITparshas@it Shemini. So how could Aharon do as Hashem commanded, if Hashem had only commanded this in regard to Yom Kippur? Therefore he explains, “When Yom Kippur arrived.”  @d1For his own greatness.@p3 I explained this above in @ITparshas@it Shemini, see there. @p1[3]@p2<TIE>This verse speaks of consecrated [animals].@p3 Explanation: the verse is speaking about consecrated animals that were slaughtered outside [the Temple courtyard]. (@ITGur Aryeh@it) You cannot say the verse is saying that [even] unconsecrated animals slaughtered outside would make one liable for excision, as we find no commandment against this. You might ask that the Gemara Chulin (16b) says, “Originally, flesh of desire [i.e., unconsecrated animals killed in order to enjoy their meat] was forbidden,” and Rashi explains, “Because it is written, ’Each and every person [of the House of Israel] who will slaughter an ox, lamb, or goat etc.,” indicating that our verse is talking about unconsecrated animals? It seems to me that the correct way to explain Rashi is as follows: The main subject of the verse is not unconsecrated animals because the verse makes one liable for excision, and there is no penalty of excision regarding unconsecrated animals. However, because Scripture writes in general terms, “Each and every person of the House of Israel who will slaughter an ox, lamb, or goat,” instead of writing, “who will slaughter a burnt-offering or a sacrifice,” this indicates that no animal may be slaughtered outside because “meat of desire” was forbidden to them. Because no animal may be slaughtered outside as meat of desire was forbidden to them, the verse did not write, “who will slaughter a burnt-offering or a sacrifice,” as that would have implied that other meat is permitted to slaughter outside. Therefore, since nothing may be slaughtered [anywhere] except for consecrated animals, because they were forbidden to eat meat of desire, the verse did not need to specify consecrated animals and wrote in general terms, “who will slaughter an ox, lamb, or goat.” @d1Outside the [Temple] courts.@p3 I.e., when it is written “within the encampment” here, it does not mean the priestly encampment, i.e., within the Temple courts, making someone liable for excision if he slaughtered a sacrifice outside its correct place north of the altar. [This is not so], because even if one slaughtered in the south, what liability would there be for this, so long as he slaughtered within the Temple courts? [The Toras Kohanim derives from the words “beyond the encampment.” See @ITRe’m@it]. Therefore it means outside the Temple courts. @p1[4]@p2<TIE>As one who shed the blood.@p3 I.e., it is as if it said, “It shall be considered [for that person] as blood of a person.” Because if not, would we not know that it is considered bloodshed [of an animal] when a person spills blood during the slaughtering. @p1[5]@p2<TIE>Which they were accustomed to slaughter.@p3 Because if it refers to their actually slaughtering them, this would mean the same as “their sacrifices” and why would the verse repeat itself? Therefore one must say “they slaughter” means “which they are accustomed to slaughter.” Alternatively, you might ask that “which they slaughter” implies that the animal has already bee slaughtered, yet afterwards it is written, “And slaughter them as peace-offerings”? @ITRe’m@it<QC>
@p1[8]@p2<TIE>Outside [the Temple Courts].@p3 Because you might ask: What does “who will bring a burntoffering” come to prohibit? If it is to prohibit slaughtering sacrifices outside, it already said “Each and every person etc. who will slaughter” above, (verse 2) in this @ITparsha.@it Rashi explains that it comes “to make liable one who burns limbs outside as one who slaughters outside.” I.e., even though someone already slaughtered it outside and disqualified the sacrifice, and you might have thought that someone who offered it after this invalid slaughtering would incur no transgression because the first person had already disqualified it. The verse teaches that they both transgressed and are both are liable. @p1[9]@p2<TIE>His children will be cut off.@p3 (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) Rashi does not explain this above in v. 4), because there it says “from among his people” in the singular form. But “from his peoples” [here], in the plural form, implies to some degree that there are many sorts of excisions. (@ITGur Aryeh@it) This is a difference between excision and death: death is decreed on the individual person, whereas excision cuts off him and his children. Death does not affect one’s children because so is the way [of the world], a generation goes and another generation comes. But excision [results in] the person being cut off from the root of life and the fruit is afflicted as well. Because when a tree’s root is removed, the fruit too is afflicted with it. @p1[10]@p2<TIE>The verse says: Any blood.@p3 @ITRe’m@it writes: You might ask, why do we need “any” to include not eating the blood of unconsecrated animals? Derive this from the verse in @ITparshas@it Re’ey, “However, you may not eat the blood; on the earth are you to spill it like water,” where @ITChazal@it expound that even where there is no throwing [of blood] on the altar, there is a negative commandment [against eating blood]. He answers: It is written in both places [even though once would have been enough], similar to what the Gemara (Pesachim 28b) says regarding the obligation to eat matzoh nowadays [when there is no Pesach sacrifice]. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) With all due respect, it seems that @ITRe’m@it fails to distinguish between the expression @hh<HEB> חייב@ee<ENG>(liable), which means [to the punishment of] excision, and the expression “do not eat,” which is [in violation of] a negative commandment. This difference is obvious. @ITRe’m@it forgot what @ITChazal@it said in the first chapter of Kerisus (4a): Rava said, “The three excisions regarding blood, are for what [reason].<TIE>.<TIE>.” See there. @d1I will turn from all My [other] concerns.@p3 [Rashi says that @hh<HEB>פני@ee<ENG> means “free time” and not Hashem’s “face”], because wherever the Torah speaks of Hashem directing his face it is for good, and here it is for bad [@ITRe’m@it]. It seems to me that Rashi is answering the question of how can [the expression] “I shall @ITdirect@it” apply to anger? It should have said would be “rest” or “set down.” Therefore he explains, “I will turn away etc. and concern Myself with him” to give him according to the fruit of his deeds. This is easy to understand. (@ITR. Yaakov Taryosh@it) @p1[11]@p2<TIE>Depends on the blood.@p3 By saying this, Rashi indicates that “flesh” of the verse does not mean actual flesh, but that every creature is called flesh as it says (Bereishis 6:12), “For all flesh (@hh<HEB>כל בשר@ee<ENG>) had corrupted [its way on the earth].” He also writes “depends” to indicate that the soul is not in the blood, because the soul has no tangibility. One cannot speak of it being anywhere, but only of dependency, that its existence depends on the blood since without blood the soul is gone. He also says “therefore” instead of saying “And I have given it to you” like the verse, so that the verse is saying: Because the soul depends on the blood, therefore I have given the blood to achieve atonement for the soul of a person. Thus the verse is not saying “And I have given.<TIE>.<TIE>.” as a separate statement. It seems that the verse uses the expression “flesh” to exclude fish and locusts that are not flesh, and [therefore], when Rashi says “every creature,” this is because a soul cannot rest on any flesh that is not [of] a creature, because there is no soul without life, and no life except [in] a creature. (@ITR. Yaakov Taryosh@it).<QC>
@p1[13]@p2<TIE>[That one should not eat meat without this] preparation.@p3 Rashi (Chulin 84a) explains, “As if one hunted [it], that it was not [always] prepared for him. I.e., one should not eat meat constantly lest he become poor.” @d1Except for [ritually] unclean.@p3 You might ask: Perhaps it comes to exclude [even] @hh<HEB>טריפה@ee<ENG> [a “torn” animal], for example, if the brain membrane was pierced or if it became @hh<HEB>טריפה@ee<ENG> while being slaughtered. The answer is: Here it is written “he shall spill its blood and cover it,” and earlier (verse 4) it is written “he has spilt its blood.” Just as there it is speaking of an unfit slaughter [outside the Temple courts, so here it is speaking of an unfit slaughter], such as slaughtering a @hh<HEB>טריפה@ee<ENG>. And even so, it is written, “Cover it with earth.” If so, what does “that is permitted to be eaten” come to exclude? It must come to exclude the ritually unclean. This is in accordance with R. Meir but not the Sages. The halachah however is according to the Sages, and this requires [further]analysis. @p1[14]@p2<TIE>For the soul depends on it.@p3 Not that a person’s blood depends on his soul, but rather his soul depends on his blood. @d1The soul is the blood.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Since flesh and blood are words of the male form, why then does the verse write @hh<HEB>היא@ee<ENG> [the female form]. He answers: “The @ITsoul@it is the blood,” and the word @hh<HEB>היא@ee<ENG> refers to the soul, which is a word of the female form.<QC>
@p1[15]@p2<TIE>The carcass of a pure bird.@p3 Explanation: [This law concerns the carcass of a pure bird] because it is written (below 22:8), “He must not eat to defile himself with it,” i.e., [the verse there is speaking of a bird] that causes defilement only by eating it, and perforce it is not speaking of the carcass of an impure animal that [also] causes defilement through touching and carrying. The verse here writes “that will eat,” to teach that [it is speaking of something that] causes defilement through eating but not through touching and carrying. And this applies only to the carcass of a pure bird, because [the carcass of] an animal causes defilement through touching and carrying. [See @ITRe’m@it ) @d1When it is swallowed.@p3 To exclude before a person swallowed, when it is still in his mouth; [in that case] one is [still] pure. And to exclude after one had swallowed it and it is still in his innards and not digested, and he immersed after swallowing it, that he is pure.<QC>
@d1Whatever has within its category [the possibility of being] improperly slaughtered.@p3 I.e., it was previously kosher and now it became improperly slaughtered. Excluding.<TIE>.<TIE>. i.e., there was never a time when it was kosher. @p1[16]@p2<TIE>If he eats holy food.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: It should have said “iniquity” [not “@IThis@it iniquity”]? He answers: The word “@IThis@it iniquity” implies the specific punishment for someone who enters the Sanctuary when he is impure, i.e., the punishment written regarding other [such] impurities, which is excision. @ITRe’m@it. Alternatively, Rashi is answering the question: Why should he bear his iniquity for [merely] making himself impure? @d1And for not washing his clothes [he is punished] with lashes.@p3 (@ITMahar”i@it) Rashi is answering the question: Why does it say “his body?” It should have said “If he does not wash his clothes and does not bathe in water” as it is written nearby (verse 15), “[He] shall wash his clothing and bathe in water.” He answers: The verse writes “his body” [to specify that] “He is punished with excision for not washing @IThis body@it, etc.” Explanation: if he did not immerse, which is the [ritual] washing of the body, his punishment is excision if he eats holy food or enters the Sanctuary. But if he did not wash his clothes and threw them into the Sanctuary, or even if his clothes touched a corpse while he was wearing them and he entered the Sanctuary while the clothes were still touching the corpse, he is exempt from excision but liable for lashes.<QC>
@p1[2]@p2<TIE>A Judge who will exact punishment.@p3 (@ITRe’m@it) Because [the expression] @hh<HEB>אלהים@ee<ENG> represents the attribute of justice, i.e., to punish sins. [Whereas the expression] @hh<HEB>ה'@ee<ENG> represents the attribute of mercy, i.e., to forgive sins if a person repents, and to reward one for @ITmitzvos@it. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @ITRe’m@it did not remember what Rashi writes at the beginning of @ITparshas@it Va’eira, “’I am Adonoy,’ ([denoting] that He may be relied upon to exact retribution), etc.” We see that Rashi derives this from “I,” without regard to the expression @hh<HEB>אלהיכם@ee<ENG>. See there.<QC>
@p1[3]@p2<TIE>[And that place] in which the Israelites settled [was the most corrupt of all].@p3 Explanation: Even [worse] than the practices of the Land of Goshen, and how much more so than that of Egypt. Because if not so, why [does the verse add] “and the practices of the Land of Canaan?” [The answer is]: The verse is adding [in severity as it goes] from Egypt to Goshen, and from Goshen to Canaan. @d1Theatres.@p3 In the first chapter of Kesuvos (5a), Rashi explains that @hh<HEB>טרטיאות@ee<ENG> are palaces of non-Jewish kings and non-Jewish ministers. (@ITGur Aryeh@it): @hh<HEB>אצטדיאות@ee<ENG> is a sport where they incite bulls and other beasts to gore and fight each other. @p1[4]@p2<TIE>In the Torah as law.@p3 Such as robbery and murder. @d1You may not evade them.@p3 Because if not, why write “and follow them”? Scripture already wrote, “And keep My statutes.” @p1[5]@p2<TIE>Other subdivisions.@p3 Because if not, why write “You shall keep”? Scripture already wrote, “And you shall keep My statutes?” @d1Keeping and fulfilling the statutes.@p3 Explanation: Above it is written “And you shall keep My statutes,” and here it is written, “which if a man fulfills, etc.,” which refers to [both] statutes and laws. And keeping and fulfilling the laws is written above, “You shall fulfill My laws.” And here it is written “You shall keep My statutes and My laws.” @p1[6]@p2<TIE>In plural form.@p3 You might ask: It is normal for verses to speak in the plural form, which means each one of you as [above] where it says @hh<HEB>תשמרו@ee<ENG>, @hh<HEB>לא תעשו@ee<ENG>, and @hh<HEB>לא תלכו@ee<ENG>? The answer is: Here it is different, because at the beginning it is written in the singular, “each and every person,” and afterwards it is written@hh<HEB> תקרבו@ee<ENG>in the plural form. Perforce @hh<HEB>תקרבו@ee<ENG> comes to include females. You might ask: Why does the verse have to [specially] include [females] regarding prohibited relationships, which is a negative commandment, for females too are obligated to keep negative commandments since they are compared to men regarding all punishments of the Torah as the Gemara says in Kidushin (35a). The answer is: Prohibited relationships are different because regarding other prohibitions of the Torah such as forbidden foods of @hh<HEB>נבילה@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>טריפה@ee<ENG>, it is logical that a woman is liable because she violates the prohibition the same manner a man does. But regarding prohibited relationships, the man is the active party whereas the woman does nothing for she is [as passive] as the earth. Therefore, the Torah needs to include that she too is liable. @d1Faithful to give a reward.@p3 Even though here there is no performance of a mitzvah but only keeping away from a sin, and the giving of a reward is only appropriate regarding to an action, one may say that if a person had opportunity to sin and refrained himself from sinning, he is rewarded as if he performed a mitzvah, as we find in Kidushin 39b. @p1[7]@p2<TIE>Its plain meaning.@p3 I.e., homosexuality. @ITRe’m@it writes, “You might ask against R. Yehuda and against Rashi who cites him: Why do they not use the @ITgezeira shava@it ’your father’ ’your father’ from the verse “The nakedness of your father’s wife you shall not uncover; it is your father’s nakedness,” which is juxtaposed and it is a negative commandment just like it, and [instead] bring a @ITgezeira shava@it from the verse in @ITparshas@it Kedoshim which deals with punishment. He leaves the matter unanswered. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) But I say that the question itself hints [at the answer]. Because [if this was derived] from “the nakedness of your father’s wife” that is juxtaposed to it, you could ask, as it asks there (Sanhedrin 74a), “This only teaches that there is a negative commandment etc. From where do we derive that one is liable to punishment?” Because the juxtaposed verse too, is only a negative commandment! Therefore he had to learn it from “the nakedness of his father he uncovered.” See there. @d1[Who] is not the wife of his father.@bo I.e., if he was born from a woman raped or seduced by his father.<QC>
@p1[9]@p2<TIE>Even the daughter of a [woman] raped [by your father].@p3 And the verse (11), “The nakedness of the daughter of your father’s wife,” teaches that she must be someone whom your father could marry, excluding your sister born to your father from a maidservant whom one cannot marry [i.e., the marriage would be null and void] as it is written (Bereishis 22:5), “Remain here with the donkey,” [hinting], a people similar to a donkey. @p1[10]@p2<TIE>His daughter [from a woman he] raped.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Since it is written “your son’s daughter or your daughter’s daughter,” this implies that the daughter of a son or daughter she had from another man is permitted. But it is written (v. 17), “The nakedness of a woman and her daughter you shall not uncover. The daughter of her son and the daughter of her daughter”! Therefore Rashi explains: [Over here] we are dealing with a raped woman who is not his wife. Therefore [regarding her children] there is only a prohibition against the daughter of his daughter who came from his seed. But the daughter of the woman he raped came from the seed of other men, she is not included in the prohibition of “you shall not uncover” [in our verse]. And the same law applies to the daughter of his wife who is not his daughter. @d1We learn from the [prohibition], etc.@p3 Explanation. You might ask: Since this verse “The nakedness of your son’s daughter,” is dealing with rape, from where do we know [the prohibition against] his daughter and the daughter of his daughter or son [that resulted] from marriage? You cannot answer that this is derived through a kal vachomer from [our verse that forbids offspring of] the woman he raped, because we cannot derive prohibitions or punishment from logical arguments@IT.@it Rashi answers: “His daughter and daughter’s daughter from his wife we learn.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @d1[This could be derived by] a @HB<HEB>קל וחומר@BO<ENG> for your [own] daughter.@bo. Explanation: By a kal vachomer for your daughter of a raped woman. Because [the prohibition of your daughter] through marriage is [already] derived from “the nakedness of a woman and her daughter” (verse 17). @d1[It was] derived it from a @HB<HEB>גזירה שוה@BO<ENG>.@bo Here, regarding the “the nakedness of your son’s daughter,” it is written @hh<HEB>הנה@ee<ENG>, and later (verse 17) where it is written “a woman and her daughter” it is also written @hh<HEB>הנה@ee<ENG>. Just as @hh<HEB>הנה@ee<ENG> written there deals with one’s daughter, so @hh<HEB>הנה@ee<ENG> written here deals with one’s daughter.<QC>
@p1[14]@p2<TIE>“You shall not approach his wife.”@p3 But regarding the nakedness of your father (above, verse 7), it does not have to write afterwards “You shall not approach his wife” to inform you what his nakedness is, [i.e., that it refers to his wife and not to himself], since the verse relies on the @hh<HEB>גזירה שוה@ee<ENG> [cited] above. (@ITGur Aryeh@it) Explanation: [Do not say that] “the nakedness of your father’s brother” is [a prohibition] in itself [and that] “you shall not approach his wife” [is a prohibition] in itself, so that “the nakedness of your father’s brother” is literal and makes one liable for two [prohibitions], for homosexuality and for “the nakedness of your father’s brother.” Because according to the plain meaning of the verse this would be illogical, as [in that case] it should have written “@ITAnd@it you shall not approach his wife.” @p1[15]@p2<TIE>Excluding a woman raped.@p3 Rashi does not say “[excluding] a woman raped” above (verse 11) regarding “the nakedness of the daughter of your father’s wife,” because above we include [the daughter of] a raped woman to make one liable, since it is written (verse 9), “your father’s daughter,” and Rashi explains, “Even the daughter of a [woman] raped [by your father].” You might ask: What is the difference that here, the verse “your son’s wife” excludes even “a woman raped,” whereas regarding “the nakedness of your father’s wife” we do not exclude a woman raped? If this is because the verse above includes her by writing “your father’s daughter,” which implies even the daughter of a raped woman, here too it is written “your daughter-in-law,” which should imply even a raped woman? @ITRe’m@it answers: “There it is different, as there are two verses and each one is expounded separately. And since one (verse 9) implies even a raped woman and one (verse 11) implies that we exclude a raped woman, in order to prevent a contradiction they expounded that it [verse 11] only comes to exclude a handmaiden or a non-Jewish woman in order to resolve [the apparent contradiction between] both verses. But here where the inclusion and the exclusion are in the same verse, they are not expounded separately. Rather each one explains the other. What daughter-in-law did I prohibit? The one that your son has a marital relationship; however, a raped woman etc., with whom your son does not have a marital relationship.<TIE>.<TIE>. @p1[17]@p2<TIE>But if he raped a woman, he is permitted to marry her daughter.@p3 Regarding “The nakedness of your son’s daughter.<TIE>.<TIE>.” where the verse forbids the daughter of the woman raped [by one’s son], it only forbids the son’s daughter or his daughter’s daughter from the raped woman, but not her daughter or her daughter’s daughter [that did not result from the rape].  @d1An [evil] plan.@p3 Because the @hh<HEB>דגש@ee<ENG> [dot] in the @hh<HEB>מ"ם@ee<ENG> implies that it is double. This results in the word @hh<HEB>זמם@ee<ENG>, which connotes thought. @p1[18]@p2<TIE>Both as one.@p3 As it was learnt in the Mishnah, “Someone who marries a woman and her daughter, or a woman and her sister [together] at one time, neither are married [to him] as it is written, ’You shall not take a woman and her sister,’ [meaning], you shall have no ’taking’ [marriage] even to one of them.” The meaning of @hh<HEB>אל אחותה@ee<ENG> [lit. to her sister] is like @hh<HEB>על@ee<ENG> and means @hh<HEB>עם אחותה@ee<ENG>, “@ITwith@it her sister.” This is similar to @hh<HEB>על נשיו@ee<ENG> (Bereishis 28:9), which means “@ITwith@it his wives.” @d1As long as [his former wife] is alive.@p3 (@ITDevek Tov@it) Because if not, why write “in her lifetime?” The verse already wrote “with her sister” which implies [taking] both together as one.<QC>
@p1[28]@p2<TIE>So is the Land of Israel: It cannot sustain [sinners].@p3 Because the plain reading of the verse implies that the land will not expel Israel even if they defile it; as it expelled the nation that defiled it. But if so, what threat is this to them that they should keep the laws and statutes? Therefore, he brings the parable of the king’s son. I.e., you will be like the king’s son who vomits immediately if he eats something disgusting because he is sensitive. So with you, if you defile the land, it will expel you immediately and you will not last many days on the land, like the nation before you that lasted may days on the land even though they did all these abominations. However, you it will expel immediately if you do these abominations. @p1[29]@p2<TIE>Both male and female are implied.@p3 See v. 6 above, “You shall not approach.”<QC>
@p1[30]@p2<TIE>To warn the Court.@p3 Because if to warn Israel about this, it already says (v. 26), “You shall adhere to My statutes etc., and not do any of these abominations.” It seems that Rashi infers this idea because it is written “You shall keep my watch,” which implies to make a safeguard for My watch, and then it is written@hh<HEB> לבלתי עשות @ee<ENG> (lit. that it shall not be done), instead of writing @hh<HEB>לא תעשו@ee<ENG> (you shall not do). Perforce this is a warning for the Court to make a fence and barrier so that no one, God forbid, ends up committing a sin. (@ITNalit@it) @d1And you are cut off from Me.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: At the beginning of the section@IT @it(verse 2) it is written, “I am Adonoy, your God” [so why repeat it]? Therefore Rashi explains: “I am Adonoy, your God” here means to accept My kingdom and My statutes because it is for this purpose that I took you out [of Egypt]. Therefore, when you defile yourselves and do not keep My decrees you are cut off from Me. If so, what benefit does the world have from you since you do not keep the decrees and statutes of the Holy One, and certainly you do not keep the decrees and statutes of other mortal kings. Therefore you are liable to destruction since there is no need for you, especially when you worship idols.<QC>
@p1[2]@p2<TIE>During an assembly.@p3 You might ask: Moshe taught the whole Torah to Israel as Rashi says in @ITparshas@it Ki Sisa. The answer is: This @ITparshah@it was said to them in an assembly of women and children [too] as it is written, “the entire congregation [of] Bnei Yisroel,” and [also] as it is written in @ITparshas@it Vayeilech (Devarim 31:12), “Assemble the people — the men and the women and the infants.” But [generally], Moshe taught the men only. Another answer is: Moshe [generally] taught them in groups, one after the other, but this @ITparshah@it was in the assembly of all Israel. The difference [of teaching in this manner] was that no one could say, “I do not accept this mitzvah because I have questions against it, and the reason I did not ask Moshe immediately is because not all Israel were present there.” Therefore, [here] all Israel were together so that no one could say this. [See @ITRe’m@it] @d1From sexual crimes.@p3 Because [one may have thought that] holiness is only discernable in Jews when they are separate and apart from the nations, through acts like tzitzis, etc., and tefillin and [by keeping] other positive commandments. But separation is not discernable by keeping negative commandments. And he explains: “Separate yourselves etc.,” meaning that this [command] applies @ITeven@it to sexual prohibitions mentioned above. When Rashi says “from transgression,” he also means the transgression of sexual prohibitions. @p1[3]@p2<TIE>Each one of you.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: “Man” is the singular [form], but @hh<HEB>תיראו@ee<ENG> is the plural form?<QC>
@d1Two are [implied]. If so, why is “man” mentioned?@p3 You might ask: We say that Scripture equates woman to man (Kiddushin 35a) [and therefore “man” implies women as well]? The answer is: This only applies where Scripture writes a masculine @ITexpression@it, but where it writes “@ITman@it,” women are excluded unless there is an inclusive expression. A concept similar to this we find in Tosfos (Sanhedrin 66a). I found this. @d1But a woman is under the control of others.@p3 You might ask: If so, why does the Torah include a woman? The answer is: [To include] a divorced woman or a widow, for example, who is not under the control of others. @d1@HB<HEB>שמשדלתו@BO<ENG>.@p3 Explanation: She wins him over [lit. seduces him] as Targum translates @hh<HEB>כי יפת@ee<ENG>, “If a man seduces” (Shemos 22:15), @hh<HEB>ארי ישדל@ee<ENG>. @d1Are obligated.@p3 Rashi is answering the following question: Why do we explain that the verses are juxtaposed to teach that even though I warned you regarding the fear of one’s father and mother, this does not push aside Shabbos? Rashi says the opposite in @ITparshas@it Vayakhel (Shemos 35:2), that whatever is mentioned first in the verse is the more important as he says there. And here since the fear of one’s father and mother precedes Shabbos, perhaps fear of one’s father and mother should push aside Shabbos? In addition, how can Rashi say, “And so it is in regard to all the other @ITmitzvos@it”? Perhaps only Shabbos is not pushed aside because of its severity that it includes a positive commandment and a negative commandment, whereas other mitzvos would be pushed aside by [fear of one’s] father and mother? Therefore Rashi explains: “’I am Adonoy your God.’ You and your father [are obligated to honor Me].” @d1{To] honor Me.@p3 You might ask: In this parshah “honor” is not written, only “fear.” Also, Rashi previously explained the reason why “man” is mentioned is because it is in a man’s [power to do]. Rashi apparently means to say that this parshah is discussing “honor” for the expression “in one’s power” and “not in one’s power” does not pertain to “fear.” The answer is that before, a woman is included to “fear” for @hh<HEB>תיראו@ee<ENG>, is written [in the plural form]. Nonetheless, a man’s obligation is greater than a woman’s because Scripture uses the term “man” [@hh<HEB>איש@ee<ENG>], as Rashi previously explained. And if it cannot be applied to “fear” because the expression “in one’s power” and “not in one’s power” does not pertain to “fear,” then apply it to “honor.” The expression “not in one’s power” definitely does not pertain to “honor” for a woman is under the control of others. @d1He may not sit in his place.@p3 Some explain that this includes any place that is especially [reserved] for him in the house. And some explain that this is the special place he has [when he sits] with the elders. @d1Nor speak in his place.@p3 Such as when the elders are speaking one after the other. When his time comes to speak, his son should not speak in his place. @d1And what is honor? He provides food.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 You might ask: Why does Rashi say this here [at the end of the verse]? He should have explained it above [where the verse said, “A man — you shall fear his mother and father”]? Also, he should have explained this in @ITparshas@it Vayishma Yisro [where honoring parents is mentioned in the Ten Commandments]? The answer is: Without this explanation [that honoring parents does not push aside mitzvos], I would think fear includes that even if he told you to desecrate Shabbos, you should listen to him and desecrate it. And so with all the mitzvos, if he tells you to transgress them you are obligated to listen to him and transgress them. And honor, which is written elsewhere, means to not sit in his place etc. But now that Rashi explains that fear of one’s father and mother does not push aside the mitzvos, we are forced to say that fear means to not sit in his place. If so, what is honor? He answers, “He provides food.<TIE>.<TIE>.”<QC>
@p1[4]@p2<TIE>To worship them.@p3 Meaning, do not turn your thoughts to worshipping them. “To worship them” should not be understood literally, because this is already mentioned, once in the Ten Commandments (Shemos 20:5), and once in @ITparshas@it Mishpatim (22:19) where it taught that it is forbidden to worship them even in an unusual way [see Rashi ibid]. Furthermore, Rashi writes afterwards, “When you turn to follow them, in the end you will make them gods.” But [according to the literal meaning of Rashi] he already made them gods when he served them? Thus one must say that Rashi means “do not turn your thoughts to worshipping them.” You cannot say [the verse means] do not turn to look at them, because if so it should have written “Do not look.” @d1In the end [you will make them gods].@p3 Because if not, why does it initially refer to them as @hh<HEB>אלילים@ee<ENG> [which connotes nothingness] and afterwards Scripture calls them gods. @d1Nor may others [make them] for you.@p3 I.e., we divide the verse. “Do not make” means “for others,” and “for yourselves” means “nor may others [make them] for you.” It is two commandments, one, “do not make” and one, “for yourselves.” @d1And if you say [the verse means]: Do not make [them] for yourselves, etc.@p3 You might ask: Why does Rashi not ask also, “[And if you say the verse means: Do not make them for yourselves], but you may make them for others.” The answer is: This question would not be answered [by his answer] because “you must not have” only implies that when he or others make [an idol] for him he may not keep it. But “you must not have” does not imply that he may not make for others. You might ask: If so, perhaps one is permitted to make [idols] for other because it only writes “Do not make for yourselves?” The answer is: Because we include from “you must not have” that you may not have what you make or what others make. This indicates that “for yourselves” written in our verse is not connected with “Do not make,” because what others make is also forbidden for you. Thus we have to divide the verse and if so, “Do not make” implies for others [as well]. @ITMaharitz@it. @p1[5]@p2<TIE>This @BIparashoh@BO was said only to teach, etc.@p3 (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) Explanation: Because all this is [already] written in @ITparshas@it Tzav [including that one must have intention to eat it during the proper time]. Rashi answers: It is written here “to teach etc.” Because from [what is written] there, one might have thought that even if he had no intention at all the offering would also be accepted. Therefore, this @ITparashoh@it is stated [to teach] that if he had no intention at all, even though it is not an abomination, nonetheless, the offering is not accepted. @d1If one handles holy offerings, etc.@p3 I.e., if one is involved with something (else) and he happened to slaughter. For example, he threw [a knife] at a wall to affix it [in the wall], and while throwing, the animal was slaughtered without intent. @p1[7]@p2<TIE>Perhaps they should be liable to @BIkoreis@BO.@p3 I.e., if he thought, while he was slaughtering, on condition to eat it outside its [proper] @ITplace@it. The verse says: “And anyone who eats from it, etc. This is written regarding outside its [proper] @ITtime@it. @d1With the intention [of eating it] outside its [proper] place.@p3 I.e., while slaughtering he thought of eating it outside its place, i.e., outside the [courtyard] curtains.<QC>
@p1[8]@p2<TIE>[The verse speaks] of absolute @HB<HEB>נותר@BO<ENG>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Since verse 7 which states, “And if it should be eaten at all,” is speaking of someone having the thought of outside its place and he does not incur the punishment of @ITkoreis,@it how can Scripture write “Whoever eats from it shall bear his iniquity,” which implies that he does have the punishment of @ITkoreis@it?@IT @itHe answers: “This verse speaks of absolute @hh<HEB>נותר@ee<ENG>.” @d1[Our Rabbis] derived it from a @HB<HEB>גזירה שוה@bo<ENG>. It says here, “Whoever eats from it shall bear his iniquity,” and elsewhere in @ITparshas@it Tzav (7:18) it says “Anyone who eats of it shall bear [the burden of] its iniquity.” Just as there it speaks of absolute @hh<HEB>נותר@ee<ENG>, so here it speaks of absolute @hh<HEB>נותר@ee<ENG>. @p1[9]@p2<TIE>A corner at the end of his field.@p3 Rashi means, when he ends reaping his field, not when he starts.<QC>
@d1[Which fall down] during harvesting.@bo Explanation: But not during the picking off of grains [by hand]; if these fall from his hand they are not considered “gleanings” because harvesting is generally done with a scythe as this is the usual way. @d1Three are not [considered] “gleanings.”@p3 Because in @ITparshas@it Emor (later 23:22) it is also written, “You shall not gather the gleaning of your harvest. You shall leave @ITthem@it for the poor and the proselyte,” and the smallest of many (@ITthem@it) is two. I also found that it says (Shemos 12:22), “Take a bunch (@hh<HEB>אגודת@ee<ENG>) of hyssop,” and Rashi explains, “Three stalks are called an @hh<HEB>אגודה@ee<ENG>.” Therefore, Rashi explains here that three are not “gleanings” but an @hh<HEB>אגודה@ee<ENG>. @p1[10]@p2<TIE>You must not take [the] gleanings.@p3 An expression [similar to] @hh<HEB>עולל ויונק@ee<ENG>, “infant and suckling” (Yirmeyahu 44:7). I.e., the small clusters. @d1No “shoulders.”@p3 Explanation: They are not next to each other and lying one on the other as when people rest on each other’s shoulder. “Drippings” means like drops that drip one after the other, and are not near and next to each other. This is called “drippings.” Explanation: some clusters have stalks going in all directions off the main stem, one above the other, and grapes hang on these stalks in one bunch. The combination of all those stalks with their grapes creates the cluster. Some clusters do not have stalks coming off at all, but only single grapes coming off their main stem and going down from the top of the cluster to the bottom. Each of these two kinds is not called “gleanings” but a cluster. However, whatever is not of these two kinds just mentioned, but has grapes all gathered together in one place with no main stem at all, and most of this type are called @hh<HEB>בוסר@ee<ENG> (unripe grapes) and are found at the top of vines, this is called “gleanings” and the verse commands us to not take them. @ITRe’m@it. See @ITmaseches@it Pei’ah chapter 10 where Rabbeinu Shimshon explains at length “shoulders” and “drippings.”<QC>
@d1[The single] berries of the grapes.@bo I.e., @hh<HEB>פרט@ee<ENG> connotes a single item like @hh<HEB>פרט וכלל@ee<ENG> (an individual case and a general rule); meaning [the single] berries of grapes. @d1A Judge Who punishes.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: It is written “You shall not glean,” “You shall not gather,” all in the singular form, and [then] it is written, “I am Adonoy, your God (@hh<HEB>(אלקיכם@ee<ENG> in the plural form. [The answer is]: He punishes [many] “souls,” since [by taking away] the thief’s soul he also takes away the souls of the thief’s sons when they are orphaned, [because a poor person is considered dead]. @d1Nothing less than [your] souls.@p3 (@ITGur Aryeh@it) Because if not, why [does Scripture] mention here, more than elsewhere, [that Hashem is] faithful to pay back. @p1[11]@p2<TIE>[This is] a prohibition against one who steals money.@bo Rashi means that over there, since it is written, “You shall not murder,” “You shall not commit adultery,” which are liable for a court-exacted death penalty, therefore, “You shall not steal” too is speaking of [a case liable for] a court-exacted death penalty. Therefore, “you shall not steal” [here] must refer to money because if not so, why two [verses]? [@ITRe’m@it] @ITRe’m@it writes: You might ask, why does Rashi need to prove from there that the Torah here is speaking of stealing money? He should have proved it from here, because from here too it is obvious [that it is speaking of stealing money] because of [the rule that] “a matter is interpreted according to its context,” since the verse here only speaks of monetary cases. [I say], the answer is that here too the verses are speaking of [cases punishable by] death because it is written (in the previous verse), “I am Adonoy, your God,” and Rashi explains, “A Judge Who punishes [wrongdoers], and [for this sin] I exact from you, nothing less than [your] souls.” And this [indeed], is why Rashi mentioned this exegesis above [in verse 10]. It also seems to me that Rashi is answering the question that you could have said the opposite; that here the verse is talking about kidnapping and above it is talking about stealing money? Rashi answers, “This matter is deduced from its context, etc.” This is not like @ITRe’em@it’s explanation above that Rashi is answering the question “Why [do we need] two [verses]?” This is easy to understand. (@ITGur Aryeh@it). Rashi here is not trying to deduce that the verse here is talking about stealing money. Rather, he is answering why the verse [here] has to write “You shall not steal” since it already wrote “You shall not steal” in the Ten Commandments that includes everything, both money and people since the verse writes in general terms, “Do not steal.” He answers that the verse “Do not steal” of the Ten Commandments is certainly [only] speaking of kidnapping because “this matter is deduced from its context.” But he was certainly never bothered by the question why Scripture had to write “Do not steal” in the Ten Commandments once it writes “do not steal” here, because it is obvious that the verse here is talking [only] about money, because it says “You shall not deny,” and [stealing] is certainly the same as “you shall not deny” because [in the latter] too one is taking the money of his fellow. But “You shall not steal” of the Ten Commandments is not completely the same as “Do not murder” and “Do not commit adultery,” and therefore one may have thought that there it is talking about every [kind of] theft, whether of money or people. Therefore, he has to say that there it is talking only about kidnapping because “something is deduced from its context.” Regarding “you shall not steal” [of the Ten Commandments] no punishment is stated. Therefore you cannot explain that one verse is for the punishment and one is for the negative commandment. Therefore, he has to say that one [verse] is talking about kidnapping, and the other, about stealing money. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it)<QC>
@d1If you steal, in the end you will deny.@p3 It seems that Rashi deduces this as the verse should have written “You shall not deny” without [writing beforehand] “and.” Because “you shall not steal” [applies to stealing] both from a Jew or from a non-Jew as Rambam writes at the beginning of the first chapter of Laws of Theft, and as Smag writes in @ITLavin@it 195, [whereas the next two commands of the verse only apply to acting against Jews]. Because grammatically, “You shall not steal” is not connected with @hh<HEB>בעמיתו@ee<ENG> (lit. “against one’s fellow [Jew]”) [at the end of the verse], because if it was [connected], it should have said @hh<HEB>מעמיתו@ee<ENG> (“from one’s fellow) and not @hh<HEB>בעמיתו@ee<ENG>. Furthermore, the cantillation interrupts it [from @hh<HEB>מעמיתו@ee<ENG>], i.e., the @ITesnach@it [that signifies the end of a clause] under @hh<HEB>לא תגנובו@ee<ENG>. Therefore, the verse says “(You shall not steal), @ITand@it you shall not deny, @ITand@it each one of you.<TIE>.<TIE>.,” in order to hint that they are connected to each other as one causes the other, because “in the end, etc.” (@ITYaakov Tayrosh@it) @p1[13]@p2<TIE>This [refers to one] who withholds the wages of a hired hand.@p3 Because every expression of @hh<HEB>עשק@ee<ENG> (oppression) refers to the withholding of a hired hand’s wages. So explains Rashi in Bava Metzia 61b.<QC>
@d1[This verb] is feminine], referring to [the word] @HB<HEB>פעולה@BO<ENG> [“wages”].@p3 @ITRe’m@it explains that if the letter@hh<HEB>תי"ו @ee<ENG> [made @hh<HEB>תלין@ee<ENG>] a second person [male] verb, it would then make it a transitive verb, [i.e., a verb referring to an object]. But we never find this word used except as an intransitive verb, such as @hh<HEB>וילן שם @ee<ENG>, “And he spent the night there” (Bereishis 28:11), @hh<HEB>וילינו שם@ee<ENG>, “And they spent the night there” (Shoftim 19:4), @hh<HEB>כי ברחוב נלין @ee<ENG>, “We will spend the night in the street” (Bereishis 19:2), except for the verse@hh<HEB>ערום ילין בלי לבוש @ee<ENG>, “They spend all the night naked without clothing” (Iyuv 24:7). [Therefore], it is better to explain it as referring to [the word] @hh<HEB>פעולה@ee<ENG>, so that it is intransitive like the others. [Alternatively], I think that if it referred to the householder, the word “in your possession” would be unnecessary as the verse should simply have said, @hh<HEB>לא תלין פעולת שכיר עד בוקר@ee<ENG>, “Do not leave the wages of a day-laborer overnight until morning.” @d1The verse speaks of a day-laborer.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: This verse implies that the wage may remain the whole night and there is only a prohibition until the morning, but in @ITparshas@it Ki Seitzei (Devarim 24:15) it is written “And let the sun not set upon it.” He therefore answers that the verse speaks of a day-laborer.<QC>
@d1A half-day period (@HB<HEB>עונה@BO<ENG>).@p3 A twelve hour period of either day of night, is called “@hh<HEB>עונה@ee<ENG>.” @p1[14]@p2<TIE>The verse says: “[Do not curse] among your people.”@p3 [We deduce that it includes everyone] because the verse should simply have said, “Do not curse a leader.” Why say “among your people”? Therefore it comes to include anyone among your people. And that which the Rabbis expound [that the prohibition of not cursing anyone only applies if] the person who acts in accordance with the behavior of your people [i.e. observing the commandments], is only based on the juxtaposition [of the two terms], for the verse juxtaposes the commandment regarding “a leader” to the commandment regarding “your people.” @d1Excluding the dead.@p3 Because if not for this exclusion, I would think that the dead are also included since later (20:9) it is written “Any man that curses his father or his mother” [which is expounded] to include after death. Therefore this exclusion is needed.<QC>
@d1Advice which is unsuitable for him.@p3 You might ask, how does Rashi know this? Perhaps the explanation of the verse is according to it its plain meaning? The answer is that Rashi himself answers [this by saying], “’You shall fear your God,’ since this matter is not given over to people, etc.” If you said that “before a blind person” is explained according to its simple meaning, this then is a matter that can be detected by others that this person’s intent is evil, because he put an obstacle by the blind person’s feet. The phrase “you shall fear your God” is inapplicable in a matter that can be detected by others. Therefore, the explanation is certainly not according to its plain meaning. [However], you might ask [on this answer] that when the verse says “you shall fear your God,” it is speaking of a case where no one sees [the person putting the stumbling block before the blind person]. Therefore, it seems that we learn this from “whoever misleads the blind about the way” (Devarim 27:18) in @ITparshas@it Ki Savo, and there itself from where do we know [that it speaking about bad advice?] See there, where I explained it. (R. Yaakov Taryosh) @d1[While] you maneuver against him.@bo [@hh<HEB>עוקף@ee<ENG> is] similar to@hh<HEB>אל תבא עליו בעקיפין @ee<ENG>, “you must not approach him deviously” in @ITparshas@it Behar (Rashi later, 25:50), and it is an expression of deviousness as Rashi explains in Bava Kama (113a), “With devious schemes.” It is similar to @hh<HEB>עוקב@ee<ENG>, as in the expression @hh<HEB>ויעקבני זה פעמים@ee<ENG>, “He has deceived me twice” (Bereishis 27:36), because @hh<HEB>פ"א@ee<ENG> interchanges with @hh<HEB> ב'@ee<ENG>as Rashi himself explains this below (verse 16). @p1[15]@p2<TIE>And an abomination is called accursed and detestable.@p3 And an abomination is also called hateful as it says in @ITparshas@it Re’eh (Devarim 12:31), “Because whatever is abominated by G-d, what He hates, [they have done].” @d1A poor man.@p3 Because if not so, why [command] “You shall not favor a poor man?” Are all these [cases] not included in “You shall not commit injustice in judgment”? @d1Another interpretation: Judge your fellow [favorably].@p3 [You need the second interpretation] because you might ask that once it is written “You shall not commit injustice in judgment,” one would certainly judge with righteousness. And according to the other interpretation you might ask that it should have said @hh<HEB>צדק@ee<ENG> (favorably). Why is it written @hh<HEB>בצדק@ee<ENG> (with favor)? Therefore you need the first interpretation of “According to its plain meaning.” (R. Yaakov Taryosh) @d1Favorably.@p3 I.e., you only need to judge him favorably if he is “your fellow.” But if he is wicked, judge him unfavorably. See the commentary of the Rambam in @ITmaseches@it Avos, chapter 1. @p1[16]@p2<TIE>Since the @BIkof@BO interchanges with the @BIgimmel.@p3 I.e., some letters are enunciated by the lips, some by the tongue, and some by the throat.<QC>
@d1Faithful to reward.@p3 To those who fulfill the commandments. @d1To exact payment.@p3 Explanation, to those who transgress them. (@ITGur Aryeh@it) [Even though “I am Adonoy” generally means “faithful to reward,” this verse cannot be saying that] since this negative commandment involves no urge of the evil inclination as in immoral relationships, where a person’s inclination lusts for forbidden women there is no reward here, since there is no reward unless one’s inclination urges one [to sin], as we see in the first chapter of Kiddushin. Therefore, Rashi is forced to say that this is what the verse means: “I am Adonoy” regarding everything, whether reward or punishment. Since He is faithful to pay reward, He is also faithful to exact punishment. [See @ITGur Aryeh@it] (@ITKitzur Mizrachi@it) Because you might ask, why does it say here “I am Adonoy?” These cases are visible [to everyone], “Do not be a tale-bearer among your people. You shall not stand idly by, etc.,” [and the Torah generally only writes “I am Adonoy” regarding cases where people cannot detect whether one did right or wrong and one has to fear Hashem who sees one’s hidden deeds]. Therefore [Rashi explains], “Faithful to reward.” [The Torah emphasizes this here to tell you that] even if there is a an aspect of transgression in saving someone, such as when a woman is drowning in a river and you have to save her, or if you have to save someone by killing the person pursuing him, nevertheless, I will pay reward for your good intent. Similarly the opposite, if you do not save him [because of this aspect of transgression], I am faithful to exact payment. @p1[18]@p2<TIE>Lend me your scythe.@p3 You might ask, why is a scythe used first in the example of revenge, and an axe is used first in the example of bearing a grudge? The answer is that regarding revenge he mentions a scythe first in order to add that even if he only refused to lend you a scythe which is worth one @ITzuz,@it and then he asked you for an axe which is worth five @ITzuz, @iteven so, do not take revenge and lend it. Regarding bearing a grudge he mentions an axe first so that one should take note [of the difference between these two utensils] and explain the added point discussed above. @d1This is a great principle.@p3 I.e., this mitzvah includes the whole Torah as Hillel the Elder said, “What is hateful to you, do not do to your fellow,” and Rashi explains, “’Your friend and the friend of your father do not leave’ (Mishlei 27), this is the Holy One. ’Do not leave,’ [i.e.,] do not transgress His words, because it is hateful to you when your friend transgresses your words.” It seems to me that according to this, “You shall love your friend as yourself” means as follows. What friend is spoken of? You shall love, “I, Hashem,” Who is called a friend. You shall love Me like [you love] yourself, as is said of you, “[What is hateful to you], do not do [to your fellow].” @p1[19]@p2<TIE>@BINuz@BO is an expression of something rubbed.@bo Meaning: stretched. @d1And woven.@p3 Meaning: entwined. @d1An expression of “withering.”@p3 I.e., hardened, like something twisted which is hard. @d1Combination of wool and flax.@p3 I.e., @hh<HEB>שעטנז@ee<ENG> connotes combination, that one combines wool and flax. @p1[20]@p2<TIE>I know of no similar term in @BITanach@BO.@p3 But there is a similar term in the Mishnah, such as, “If someone says, ’(You are hereby) my @ITcharufah,@it’ she is married, because in Yehudah etc.” (Kiddushin 6a). This is the plain meaning [of @ITcharufah@it]; the @ITmidrashic@it meaning [is found] in Krisus (11a). @d1Half maid-servant and half free woman.@p3 I.e., below, the verse writes @hh<HEB> והפדה לא נפדתה@ee<ENG> (lit. she is redeemed and she is not redeemed). This is a contradictory expression because if she is redeemed, why does it say, “she is not redeemed,” and if she is not redeemed, why does it say “she is redeemed”? Therefore it means “redeemed and not redeemed,” as Rashi soon explains. @d1Who is engaged to a Hebrew slave.@p3 I.e., she is certainly betrothed to someone since the verse requires the person who had relations with her to bring a guilt-offering. But if she is betrothed to a free Jew, he would be forbidden to have relations with her because of the “maidservant part” of her And if she is betrothed to a Canaanite slave, he would be forbidden to have relations with her because of the “free part” of her. Therefore one must say she is married to a Hebrew slave to whom she is permitted. @d1By deed [of manumission].@p3 Because it is written “Or her freedom was not given to her (@hh<HEB>לה@ee<ENG>), and we learn a @ITgezeirah shavah,@it @hh<HEB>לה@ee<ENG> @hh<HEB>לה@ee<ENG> from the case of a wife where the verse writes (Devarim 24:3), “And writes for her (@hh<HEB>לה@ee<ENG>) a document of severance and places [it] in her hand.”<QC>
@d1She suffers [lashes] and not he.@p3 You should not say that the verse reveals lashes by the woman and a guilt-offering by the man and one should learn one from the other, so that the woman is [punished] with lashes and a guilt-offering and so the man. Therefore it is written @hh<HEB>תהיה@ee<ENG> [a verb in the female form] to exclude the man from lashes. @d1[Is subject] to a proclamation.@bo I.e., because it is written @hh<HEB>בקורת@ee<ENG> which is [also] an expression of @hh<HEB>קריאה@ee<ENG> (proclaiming), [this teaches] that they “call out to the one lashed.” @d1He is not liable.@p3 Because every @hh<HEB>כי@ee<ENG> in Scripture is giving a reason for what came before. @d1Thus, if she was freed.@p3 This deduction is required to teach that if she was freed even with money [and not with a document], she becomes free and is permitted to a free Jew, and her marriage is considered a marriage.<QC>
@p1[22]@p2<TIE>[This] includes one who sinned intentionally as one who sinned unwittingly.@p3 Rashi explains in chapter @ITAraba Mechusarei Kapara@it (Kerisus 9a) [where the Gemara says], “[This] includes one who sinned intentionally as one who sinned unwittingly,” that he too has to bring a sacrifice [even] for an intentional [sin in this case]. [The Gemara deduces this] because this is apparently a superfluous verse. Since it is written before “For the sin which he committed and he will be forgiven,” why does it then again write “for the sin which he committed?” This is to tell you that one brings a sacrifice even for an intentional [sin].<QC>
@p1[23]@p2<TIE>It should be permitted after three years.@p3 And the verse would mean as follows: Three years the fruit shall be closed off and from then onwards it will be permitted. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) It seems to me that if we counted the three years from the time it produces fruit, we would obviously know that whatever grew during the three years is forbidden forever. But now that we count from its planting even if it produced nothing, and that which grows after three years is permitted immediately, this implies that the matter does not depend on fruit but on years. So one may have thought that even that which grew within the three years is permitted after three years since the matter is dependent on years. Therefore, the verse says, “it shall be.” @d1The verse says: “it shall be.”@p3 Meaning, in the forbidden state it had during the three years, so it shall be forever. @p1[24]@p2<TIE>That he carries it there.@p3 I think this is connected with his explanation above. You might have asked, why does Rashi explain that we learn a @ITgezeirah shavah@it “sacred,” “sacred” from [second] tithe to teach that it is permitted when redeemed? Perhaps we should learn a @ITgezeirah shavah@it “sacred,” “sacred” from the Sabbatical Year teaching that it cannot be redeemed as it says later (25:12), “For it is a jubilee, it shall be sacred to you.” Rashi answers that if we would learn “sacred,” “sacred” from the Sabbatical Year, we would be unable to resolve what is written afterwards, “Holy [upon which to say] praise[s to] Adonoy,” since it would be forbidden to redeem it and eat it. If [the @ITgezeirah shavah@it] applied to [second] tithes it would be all right for the verse to write “Holy [upon which to say] praise[s to] Adonoy,” and that “this matter is ’praise to Adonoy.’” However, the Gemara (Berachos 35a) explains this differently.<QC>
@p1[26]@p2<TIE>A mole.@p3 [To interpret] their cries or meeting them for good or for bad. Eliezer, Avraham’s slave, and Yehonasan did not rely on this thing [omens]. Eliezer relied on Avraham’s merit as I explained above (Bereishis 24:14), and Yehonasan the son of Shaul said this in order to encourage his young man and he would have gone up in any case (Chulin 95b). @d1He says, “This day is good.”@p3 I.e., the person said this not through astrology but because this is the way of the Emorites, i.e., this is people’s common practice even though they know no logical reason for it. But if one saw through astrology that a particular day was not good for a certain matter or for his work, he may refrain from doing it; and we do not rely on miracles. I think that it forbidden to go against the constellations [relying] on a miracle, etc. All this is from the responsa of the Ramban, responsa 283. The Yoreh Dei’ah cites some of this in chapter 179. (@ITR. Yaakov Taryosh@it) @p1[27]@p2<TIE>Who makes [the hair of] his temples similar.@p3 It is as if it said, “Do not destroy [the hair of] your temples.” The verse calls them “the corners of your heads” because the ends of the head [where hair stops growing] are the end of the hair roots on the forehead, and the end of the hair roots behind the ears, and the end of the hair roots behind the head, as from there downwards it is the hair of the back of the neck which is part of the neck. Thus, all the hair roots are at the ends of the head in a circle except for the temples, which go down on each side and break the circle. And when one destroys the hairs of the temples with a razor and makes them level to behind his ears and his forehead, his whole head is left surrounded in a circle [of hair]. Therefore, when it says “Do not round the corners of your heads,” it is as if it says “Do not destroy your temples.” @ITRe’m@it. @d1Near the head.@p3 I.e., the place where the cheek meets the temple. There are two corners, [one at] the end of the [jaw] bone of the cheek [where it meets the temple], and one at the end of the width of the cheek [above], because the cheek is wide on top, and these are called “the apples of the face.” This “end” is in the middle of the face [looking from the side], and it is at the end of the width of the cheek. And there is one [more corner] at the place where the two cheeks join together at the chin where you have the @ITshiboles@it [point] of the beard (@ITRe’m@it). There are other explanations; see Tur Yoreh Dei’ah chapter 181.<QC>
@p1[28]@p2<TIE>Such is the custom of the Amorites.@p3 Because if not so, what is its relevance here to “You shall not act on the basis of omens nor act on the basis of auspicious times,” which are practices of the Amorites. @d1Because he tattoos it with a needle.@p3 With this, Rashi is telling us that he is not liable unless he wrote and he is not liable unless he engraved, and so it says in Makkos (21a). @d1And stuck into the ground.@p3 I.e., the person hung on it looks as if he is stuck into the ground, and @hh<HEB>הוקע@ee<ENG> is an expression of “sticking.” @p1[30]@p2<TIE>The building of the Temple does not supersede [the] Shabbos [laws].@p3 You might ask, how would one think that the building of the Temple supersedes Shabbos? The Temple is a positive commandment and [observing] Shabbos is a positive and negative commandment, and a positive commandment cannot supersede a positive and a negative commandment. The answer is that if not for the verse, I would think that since the sacrificial offerings that are offered in the Temple supersede Shabbos, because the Temple service supersedes Shabbos, then how much more so does the building of the Temple supersede [Shabbos]. Therefore one needs the verse. Even though Shabbos is mentioned [in the verse] before the Temple to indicate that building the Temple does not supersede Shabbos, as Rashi explains in @ITparshas@it Vayakhel (Shemos 35:2), [and thus you might ask], why does it have to say here “[You shall fear My Sanctuary], I am Adonoy”? The answer is that since the Torah writes “fear” concerning the Temple, you may have thought that it supercedes Shabbos where the commandment is to “observe,” [whereas @ITparshas@it Vayakhel is discussing the Tabernacle and not the Temple], therefore it says “I am Adonoy.” This also answers the above question [that a positive commandment generally cannot supersede a positive and negative commandment]. @p1[31]@p2<TIE>A warning to mediums.@p3 Since it says in @ITparshas@it Shoftim (Devarim 19:10,11), “Let there not exist among you [.<TIE>.<TIE>.or one who asks of a medium], etc.,” and there too, [although] it says a negative commandment prohibiting it, it does not mention @ITkareis,@it but here it mentions @ITkareis@it as it says (below, 20:5), “And [I shall] cut him off from among his people.” If so, it is certainly speaking here of the medium itself, while there it is speaking about one “who @ITasks@it of a medium.” @d1An animal whose name is @BIYadu’a.@p3 Rabbeinu Shimshon wrote in the name of R. Meir bar Kalonimus that this is an animal whose name is @ITYadu’a,@it which has a sort of big cord coming out of a root in the earth from where it gets its nourishment just like gourds and squashes do. However, the @ITYadu’a@it has the appearance of a man regarding both its face and its other limbs. It is joined from its navel to that rope and no creature can approach within the length of that rope as it tears and kills everything; within the length of its rope, it grazes all its surroundings. When people come to hunt it, they shoot arrows from afar at its cord until it is severed, and then it dies immediately. (@ITSefer Mitzvos Gedolos@it) @d1To be occupied with them.@p3 Rashi is answering the question that it is obvious that a person would not willingly [“seek out” so as to] defile himself. He answers, [that the verse is warning against seeking, i.e.,] “to be occupied with them, etc.” @p1[32]@p2<TIE>Perhaps even an ignorant (@HB<HEB>אשמאי@BO<ENG>) old man.@p3 Rashi [on that Gemara] explains that this is an expression of @hh<HEB>אשם@ee<ENG> (sin), meaning, a wicked man who is liable for many sins. Rabeinu Tam explains that this person is an ignoramus [desolate of wisdom], as in the expression “not become desolate (@hh<HEB>תשם@ee<ENG>)” (Bereishis 47:19), which Unkelos translates as @hh<HEB>לא תבור@ee<ENG>, i.e., desolate. (@ITGur Aryeh@it) You might ask that this [Rashi’s interpretation] is obvious, since why would one think that a wicked man should be honored? The verse (Shemos 22:27) writes, “Do not curse a leader of your people” [from which the Sages deduce in Bava Metzia 48b that this only applies] “when he acts [according to] the behavior of your people”! The answer is that one may have thought one has to stand in the presence of a wicked [old] man because he must have lived a long life due to having fulfilled @ITmitzvos@it, and thus, one may have thought he must be honored. Therefore, the verse is necessary. @d1Only one who has acquired wisdom.@p3 This is not derived from an acrostic of @hh<HEB>זקן@ee<ENG>, but from the @ITgezeirah shavah@it @hh<HEB>זקן זקן@ee<ENG> regarding the elders of Yisroel as it is written (Bamidbar 11:16), “Whom you know to be the people’s elders (@hh<HEB>זקני@ee<ENG>), and its officers,” meaning that they are great and wise. @d1Perhaps he is permitted to close his eyes.@p3 You might ask, how can one think he is permitted to close his eyes? Obviously, this would be a transgression! The explanation is that he might think he is permitted to close his eyes before he reaches his four @ITamos@it, since he is not obligated to rise before him until he enters his four @ITamos.@it @p1[33]@p2<TIE>The anguish of [wounding] words.@p3 Because the verse in @ITparshas@it Behar (25:14) it is written @hh<HEB>לא תונו@ee<ENG> (“do not cheat one another”), which is speaking of cheating in monetary matters since the verses there discuss buying and selling. Therefore, @hh<HEB>לא תונו@ee<ENG> here must be speaking [not about monetary matters, but] about the anguish of [wounding] words. @p1[35]@p2<TIE>One who measures is termed a judge.@p3 Since the verse writes “judgment” it teaches that one who measures is termed a judge. And the difference this makes is that “if he acts falsely in measure, he is as one, etc.” @d1And causes five [catastrophic] matters.@p3 You might ask, why do we need the word “judgment” to teach this? Here too the verse writes @hh<HEB>עול@ee<ENG> which implies “corrupt, hateful, [etc.],” as Rashi explained above (verse 15) regarding a judge. You might also ask, why does he explain here that this “causes five [catastrophic] matters, etc.” Why did he not explain this earlier regarding a judge? The answer is that Rashi is saying as follows. Why does the verse write “judgment”? To teach that he is like a judge. Concerning what? [You cannot say that it is to teach you that he is corrupt, hateful, etc.] because here too the verse says @hh<HEB>עול@ee<ENG> [which implies these things]. The answer is that he is compared to a judge to inform you that he causes the five [catastrophic] matters which are said regarding a judge. @d1Land measure.@p3 I.e., when there are two brothers or two partners, you may not measure for one of them in winter when the rope is wet and stretches more, and for the other one in the summer when the rope is hard and does not stretch, causing one of them a loss. Alternatively, even if one measures with [the length of a rod of] wood, one may not measure for one of them in summer and for the other in winter, because in summer the earth is dry and cracked, while in winter it is [tightly] joined together. @d1Liquid and dry.@p3 The correct text is, “’Volume,’ that is liquid measure.” The text should not include the words “dry measure,” because @hh<HEB>משורה@ee<ENG> is a liquid measure as it says (Amos 6:4) “And drink water in a measure.” @p1[36]@p2<TIE>That is a dry measure.@p3 Because it says [regarding manna] (Shemos 16:36), “The @ITomer@it is a tenth of an @ITeiphoh.@it” @d1That is a liquid measure.@p3 As it says [regarding oil and wine] (see Bamidbar 28:5, 6), “One fourth of a @IThin@it.” @d1Who dips his weights in salt to cheat people.@p3 Some explain that the buyer dips his weights in salt so that they should be heavy because of the dampness of the salt. Others explain that the seller dips his weights in salt as salt is strong and sharp and erodes the weight and makes it lighter, and he sells to people by weighing with this [lighter] weight.<QC>
@p1[2]@p2<TIE>The punishments for the prohibitions.@p3 Rashi is answering the question that all these negative commandments are already written in @ITparshas@it Acharei Mos. He answers that above Scripture wrote the prohibitions, and here it is writing the punishment for [violating] the prohibitions. @d1The people of the land shall assist them.@p3 Because if “the people of the land shall stone him to death” was the explanation of “he shall surely be put to death,” let the verse omit it and not write “he shall surely be put to death.” @d1For whose sake.@p3 Because if not so, why write “of the land”? It should have said, “The people shall stone him, etc.” (@ITMaharam@it). This [answer, that the land, i.e., the world, was created for their sake] is insufficient because if so, it should have said “people of the world.” And this [second answer] is also insufficient because if so, the verse should have said explicitly that it is talking about @ITEretz Yisroel.@it But because it writes [“the land”] in general terms, this implies the whole world. You might ask, why did Rashi not explain this above in @ITparshas@it Vayikra (4:27) where it is written, “(If a person should unwittingly sin [and he is]) one of the ordinary people (@hh<HEB>עם הארץ@ee<ENG>), by transgressing [one of the commandments of Adonoy that should not be done and he incurs guilt]”? The answer is that above the explanation is according to its plain meaning, anyone from the whole nation of Yisroel, whether a @ITkohein,@it a Levi, or a regular Jew, as Ibn Ezra explains. One cannot explain the same here, because why would one think there is any distinction, and thus [here] it should have said “the nation.” You cannot explain that it means “in the assembly of them all,” because if so it should have said “the entire congregation (@hh<HEB>כל העדה@ee<ENG>)” as it says in @ITparshas@it Emor (Vayikra 24:14) regarding a blasphemer. (@ITR. Yaakov Taryosh@it) @p1[3]@p2<TIE>“Free time.”@p3 Rashi is answering the question that on the contrary, it would be a favor if the Holy One directs his face to him. Also, it is His way to direct His face only onto the righteous. Therefore he explains that it is not connected with the word “face,” [rather it means “free time”]. @d1And not [a congregation].@p3 (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it). This is stated in Toras @ITKohanim@it. I think it means as follows: If the entire congregation give of their children to @ITMolech@it, they are not cut off. You cannot say it means that the whole congregation is not cut off because of the sin of the individual, since that is obvious as even his family is not cut off. See more over there. @d1From where [do we know this of] illegitimate offspring?@p3 Rashi explains in Sanhedrin (64b) that these two verses, “for he gave of his children to @ITMolech@it” and “when he gives of his children to @ITMolech@it” are superfluous. Therefore, the rabbis expound that one is to include “his son’s son and his daughter’s son,” and one is to include “illegimate offspring.”<QC>
@d1Which is sanctified to Me.@p3 But not the actual Sanctuary, because what has the defiling of the Sanctuary to do with [this] sinner? @ITRe’m@it writes, “You might ask how can the Community of Israel become defiled by one person who sinned?” It seems to me that because he served idolatry, the @ITShechinah@it leaves the land, and by the @ITShechinah@it leaving, evil spirits enter the land and automatically, [the Community of] Israel is defiled. The Zohar discusses these matters at length and there is no need to discuss this at length. @p1[5]@p2<TIE>For all of them protect him.@p3 I.e., they all try to justify his actions since they are his relatives; therefore they are all [considered] robbers. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) This seems to refer to above [where it says], “If the people of the land will hide, etc.” This is probably because they are afraid of him and his family who protect him. Therefore [the verse writes] “and his family.”  @d1[This phrase] includes worship of any other idol.@bo Since it is already written, “I shall cut him off.<TIE>.<TIE>. from among their people,” why does it again write “and cut him off”? It must have been written again in order to write “along with all those who go astray after him, etc.,” meaning, to stray after the @ITMolech@it, to do like its [service] for other idols. [This teaches] that even though this is not its usual way [of worship], if one worshipped the idol in this way his punishment is @ITkareis@it. (@ITKitzur Mizrachi@it)<QC>
@p1[7]@p2<TIE>This [refers to] separation from idolatry.@p3 Even though [Rashi] said above (Vayikra 19:2), “Wherever you find a fence against sexual crime, you find holiness,” which implies that the term “sanctity” only applies to sexual matters, the answer is that idolatry is also called a harlot (@hh<HEB>זונה@ee<ENG>) as it says here “To go astray (@hh<HEB>לזנות@ee<ENG>) after @ITMolech@it.” @p1[9]@p2<TIE>To include [cursing them] after death.@p3 You should not compare it to hitting one’s father where one is liable only when he is alive. Because if not so, the Torah already said “Any man that curses his father or his mother,” therefore it must be coming here to include after death.  @p1[10]@p2<TIE>Excluding a minor.@p3 You might ask that this is obvious since he is not liable for [any] punishment. The answer is that it is telling us that although the minor is not punished, she [an adult] is punished even if a minor had relations with her. @d1Regarding which married woman have I required you, etc.@p3 Rashi here explains at length “Regarding which married woman have I required you, etc.,” instead of [simply] saying, “’Another man’s wife,’ excluding a non-Jew’s wife,” as he said [earlier], “’A man,’ excluding a minor.” This is because he is answering the question why the verse is lengthy and writes “who commits adultery” twice. It should have simply written, “Who commits adultery with another man’s wife, the wife of his fellow man.” Therefore, he explains that the verse itself is explaining its words, “Regarding which married woman have I required you, etc. Rashi explains further, “This teaches us, etc.,” to answer the question that what difference does it make [if her husband is non-Jewish]? She is [still] a married woman! Even though they [non-Jews] are not obligated in [performing] mitzvos, she is still a married woman! Therefore he explains, “This teaches us, etc.” @d1Strangulation.@p3 Because it is written “shall be.<TIE>.<TIE>. put to death” without specifying [which death penalty], and this [case here is] a death administered by man. And we also find “death” mentioned without specifying [which death penalty], regarding a death administered by heaven, by [the deaths of] Er and Onan where it is written (Bereishis 38:10), “And He also put him to death.” [Therefore, we say that] just as a [an unspecified] death administered by heaven leaves no mark, so too, the death administered by man is one that leaves no mark. See all this in Sanhedrin (52b). @p1[12]@p2<TIE>They mix.@p3 According to the first interpretation, the root [of the word] is @hh<HEB>תבל@ee<ENG>, which has [two meanings], an expression of despising, or a term referring to all the lands [of the world]. According to the second interpretation, its root is @hh<HEB>בלל@ee<ENG>. @p1[13]@p2<TIE>One inserts.@p3 Because if not so, why write “in the same manner as with a woman?” Is there another way to lie with a male that the verse has to say “in the same manner as with a woman” in order to exclude this other way of lying? @d1Stick.@p3 Rashi explains in Bava Metzia (91a), “As one inserts a stick or spoon into a hollow tube with make-up inside, and extracts out the make-up and applies it on the eye. (@ITR. Noson@it) @p1[14]@p2<TIE>One of them.@p3 (@ITGur Aryeh@it) Why does it not write “he and her”? The answer is that if Scripture had written this I would think [the prohibition applies only] if one married the daughter legally and the mother illegally as the verse implies “Who marries a woman and her mother.” I would then say [the prohibition applies] only if the daughter was first and the mother afterwards, and that “her” referred to “her mother.” But now that it is written @hh<HEB>אתהן@ee<ENG> [which means] “one of them,” [this indicates that the prohibition applies] whether he married the mother first and the daughter illegally [and] the daughter is liable, or married the daughter first and the mother afterwards [and] the mother is liable.<QC>
@p1[17]@p2<TIE>And its midrashic interpretation: And if you argue that Cain, etc.@p3 (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) Explanation. Even though Adam could have married his daughter since a non-Jew is permitted to have relations with his daughter, and the resultant daughter would have been a niece to Kayin. This [union] is permitted even for a Jew. Although she would have been his paternal sister, a non-Jew is not regarded as related to his father. Nevertheless, the Holy One did an act of kindness with His world and forbade them to Adam and permitted them to Kayin so that the world would be built speedily. @ITRe’m@it raises a difficulty, “You might ask that this implies that if not because of “the world is built [in] kindness,” he would have been forbidden to his sister. But if so, how did the tribes marry their sisters according to R. Yehudah who says that twin sisters were born with each and every tribe and they married them? The answer is that only one’s maternal sister is forbidden [to a non-Jew], whereas a paternal [sister] is permitted. Therefore the tribes married the twin sisters of the other tribes.<QC>
@p1[20]@p2<TIE>That it [involves] the punishment of remaining childless.@p3 Explanation: In [@ITparshas@it] Acharei Mos it is written, after mentioning all the @ITarayos@it (18:29), “Their souls will be cut off, etc.” This includes the punishment of being childless, because in general, @ITkoreis@it means that he is cut off and his children are cut off. However, I [still] would not know which children are cut off. Are those he had before the sin included in [his] punishment, or specifically those born after the sin, as they were born of a wicked person? Thus the verse [here], “they will die without children,” comes to indicate that they will die childless as they are now [when they sinned, because any children he has from now on will die]. And the [next] verse “They will be without children,” comes to indicate that when they die they will be childless, because if he had children he will bury them, whether he had them before the sin or after the sin, they will all be cut off. Some texts, however, turn it round (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it). @ITRe’m@it raises a question. How can we say that @ITkoreis@it means that he and his seed are cut off? The Gemara (Mo’ed Katan 28a) says in connection with Shmuel the Ramati, that [dying like Shmuel at] 52 years is the death of @ITkoreis@it [which is between 50 and 60 years], and the reason the Gemara did not mention this [in an earlier statement] was due to Shmuel’s honor, since the Holy One had [actually] shortened his years so that he should not witness his sons’ deaths. But why should the Gemara not mention this because of Shmuel’s honor? Since he had sons this could not have been @ITkoreis@it? The answer is that the Tosefta says that [@ITkoreis@it] only applies to small sons who do not have their own merit, and does not apply to adult sons. Therefore, there is no [contrary] proof from Shmuel the Ramati as they were adults.<QC>
@p1[25]@p2<TIE>Pure for you.@p3 Explanation: Pure or impure through your action. For example, if one slaughtered the whole gullet and only half the windpipe it is impure; if one slaughtered the whole gullet and most of the windpipe it is pure. I.e., you made it pure for eating. @d1To forbid.@p3 It is pertinent for the verse to speak of “distinguishing,” since Rashi explained that “impure” means “impure for you,” i.e., impure through your action, that the majority of one “sign” was not cut. But regarding something that is the way it is without any [human] action [such being a cow or donkey], since it is pure or impure of itself, it is not pertinent [to write] “you shall distinguish,” as [Rashi explained] above.<QC>
@p1[1]@p2<TIE>Say (@HB<HEB>אמור@BO<ENG>), and you shall say.@p3 The verse should only have written, “Speak, to the @ITkohanim@it.” @eeTherefore [the apparent redundancy teaches us that], “speak” is to warn [the adult @ITkohanim@it] themselves, “and you shall say” is to warn the adults regarding the minors. You might ask why Rashi does not also say this answer [regarding the verse] “Speak (@hh<HEB>דבר@ee<ENG>) (to the entire congregation [of] Bnei Yisroel) and say (@hh<HEB>אמרת@ee<ENG>) (to them)” in @ITparshas@it Kedoshim (Vayikra 19:2). The answer is that @hh<HEB>דבור@ee<ENG> is a general [command to speak] and does not explain what the statement will be, while @hh<HEB>אמרת@ee<ENG> implies something specific, i.e., say this [particular] thing. Here however, where @hh<HEB>אמור@ee<ENG> is [already] specific, Rashi is asking why one needs [a command to say] two specific [statements]. @d1The verse says: The @BIkohanim@BO.@p3 You might ask, why does Rashi explain the verse in reverse order? He should have first explained “the sons of Aharon” and then [explained] “you shall say to them.” You might also ask, how does he derive all these lessons from “the sons of Aharon”? The answer is that Rashi is explaining as follows: Once I have explained that “you shall say to them” is to “to warn the adults regarding the minors,” why then does the verse need to write “the @ITkohanim,@it the sons of Aharon”? Without [the first explanation regarding minors] there would be no difficulty as I could say that, if it wrote “the @ITkohanim@it” and not “the sons of Aharon,” I would think the law only applied to adults and not to minors. Therefore it had to write “the sons of Aharon” in order “to warn the adults regarding the minors.” But now that I derived this from “you shall say to them,” you might ask, why write “the @ITkohanim@it”? Rashi answers, if it wrote “the sons of Aharon” and not “the @ITkohanim@it,” I would think even those who are unfit. Therefore the verse says “the @ITkohanim@it,” i.e., he must be a complete @ITkohein.@it Rashi then answers another question. How can you explain that “the @ITkohanim@it” excludes those who are unfit? Perhaps it is needed [for something else], since if it did not write “the @ITkohanim,@it” but only “the sons of Aharon,” I would think they must be perfect like the sons of Aharon, and it would exclude those who are blemished. Therefore you need “the @ITkohanim@it” to include the blemished. [To this] Rashi answers that “the sons of Aharon” implies the blemished as well and therefore this would not answer why the verse writes “the @ITkohanim.@it” Rather, you need it as I answered above, to exclude the unfit. Rashi then answers why the verse writes “the sons of Aharon.” It should only have written “the @ITkohanim@it” and from that I could exclude the unfit and include the blemished, because both of these [laws] are implied in the word “the @ITkohanim.@it” He answers that if it did not say “the sons of Aharon,” I would think that even daughters of Aharon are implied in “the @ITkohanim,@it” because wherever the Torah writes a masculine term, women are also included. Therefore it has to write “the sons of Aharon” and exclude the daughters of Aharon. See Mizrachi who explains in a different way, as follows: You need them both because if it only wrote “the sons of Aharon,” it would imply even the unfit and if so, there would be no exclusionary phrase for the unfit, and they would be included in “sons of Aharon.” [Therefore] it writes “the @ITkohanim@it” to exclude the unfit. [Rashi] then says, from where do you include even the blemished? Because the verse says “the sons of Aharon.” I.e., there is no exclusionary phrase to exclude them as “the @ITkohanim@it” came to exclude the unfit, and therefore “the sons of Aharon” implies that even the blemished [should be included]. Thus we are left with a situation where “the sons of Aharon” includes the blemished and [the Torah writes the phrase] to exclude the daughters of Aharon. Whereas if it were only written “the @ITkohanim@it” one would have thought that women @ITkohanim@it are included because men and women are [generally] treated the same regarding all the punishments of the Torah. You cannot say the other way round, which would be stringent [as follows]: “’The @ITkohanim.@it’ You might think, but not the unfit, so the verse says ’the son of Aharon,’ and even the unfit are included in the sons of Aharon.” Because if so, for what would you use the exclusionary expression “the @ITkohanim.@it” @d1Among his people.@p3 Because if not so, why say “among his people?” Therefore, it is saying [that this law only applies] when the deceased is among his people and there are many people involved in his burial. @d1Excluding a @BImes mitzvoh@BO.@p3 I.e., [when] there is no one to bury [the deceased], he is permitted to become defiled and bury the deceased. A @ITmes mitzvoh@it is every case where one [the finder of the body] calls [for help] and no one responds. (@ITGur Aryeh@it) @ITRe’em@it raises a difficulty: Why do we need a verse to permit @ITmes mitzvoh@it? Why not derive this from the @ITKohein Godol@it and @ITnazir@it who may defile themselves for a @ITmes mitzvoh@it even though they may not defile themselves for their relatives. How much more so should a regular @ITkohein@it who does defile himself for his relatives be permitted to defile himself for a @ITmes mitzvoh.@it Should his being a regular @ITkohein@it make the law more stringent for him than that of a @ITKohein Godol@it? It seems that if not for [this] verse, I would think that the verse “@eehe shall not become [ritually] impure@ee” [said of the @ITKohein Godol@it] means that he may not defile himself for no purpose, [and is] not [speaking about] for the sake of a mitzvah. But to deal with a corpse in order to bury it, where there is a mitzvah, he is permitted, and it is only forbidden when not for the purpose of a mitzvah. Therefore the Torah writes regarding the regular @ITkohein@it that whenever the dead body is “among his people” he may not defile himself, and if so, the leniency of the @ITKohein Godol@it [too] is [only in] a case of @ITmes mitzvoh@it that has no one to bury the deceased. But if there are people available to bury the deceased, he is forbidden to become defiled for it even though he would be performing a mitzvah [by doing so]. @p1[2]@p2<TIE>“His kin” [refers] to none other than his wife.@p3 I.e., “his kin” that is written here, (see Tosefos Yom Tov in Bava Basra chapter @ITYeish Nochalin@it  [Mishnah 1]. You might ask that it should have written @hh<HEB>הקרובה@ee<ENG> (@eeto whom he is closely related) in the feminine form? The answer is that wherever it is written @hh<HEB>שאר@ee<ENG> (kin) it means @hh<HEB>שאר בשר@ee<ENG> (blood kin) and thus it is as if the verse had written @hh<HEB>שאר בשר@ee<ENG>. And since @hh<HEB>בשר@ee<ENG> is masculine, it writes the masculine form @hh<HEB>הקרוב@ee<ENG>. (@ITDivrei Dovid@it) You might ask that if so, it should have said “@ITand@it for his mother” with a @ITvav,@it since @hh<HEB>שארו@ee<ENG> refers to something else. It seems that @hh<HEB>שארו@ee<ENG> actually refers to his mother and his father mentioned afterwards as they are his close relatives and his flesh. However, since one could ask [that if so], why does the Torah writes @hh<HEB>שארו@ee<ENG>, since afterwards it explicitly says to whom he may become defiled. To answer this they said that it includes his wife, because besides his wife there is no close relative of his [not already mentioned]. We need to find a reason why, in truth, the Torah does not mention the wife separately as it mentions his mother and father. It seems that we learn from this that regarding his wife too, there is a distinction [to teach us] that he does not defile himself for his betrothed. This is what the Torah is saying: he defiles himself for his wife whose marital status is similar to that of his mother and his father, but for his betrothed he is forbidden to defile himself. (The @ITPa’anei’ach Raza@it writes) that here it says “for his mother and his father,” and regarding the @ITKohein Godol@it it says “for his father and his mother,” because in both cases it goes from the obvious to the less obvious. Here, regarding the regular @ITkohein@it who defiles himself for them, it says that not only for his mother who is certainly [his mother] does he obviously defile himself, but even for his father who is in doubt [as maybe his mother conceived from someone else] he defiles himself. And regarding the @ITKohein Godol@it who does not defile himself, it says that not only for his father does he obviously not defile himself, but even for his mother he should not defile himself. (@ITDivrei Dovid@it) @p1[3]@p2<TIE>The betrothed.@p3 You might ask, why not say the opposite, that it comes to exclude the betrothed, that he may not become defiled for her? The answer is that if so, the verse need not have written “closely related,” and I would still know that the betrothed is excluded because it says “who has not yet been married” (@hh<HEB>לא היתה@ee<ENG>), since “married” (@hh<HEB>הויה@ee<ENG>) generally means betrothal. Perforce, “closely related” is coming to include, that he may become defiled for her. And [therefore], “who has not yet been married” must mean “consummated,” as Rashi explains nearby. You might ask: why say that [“closely related”] come to include “the betrothed”? Perhaps “closely related” comes to include “someone [whose signs of virginity were] struck by a stick,” so that you do not exclude “someone struck by a stick” because of the verse “virgin” which [seems to] exclude a non-virgin; and “who has not yet been married” [actually] comes to exclude the betrothed? The answer is that if so, the verse should have written neither “virgin” nor “closely related,” and I would have known that he is permitted to defile himself for “someone struck by a stick.” Therefore we must say that “closely related” comes to include the betrothed, and “who was not married” means “consummation,” and “struck by a stick” is automatically included since she became a nonvirgin without consummation. Do not ask that the verse should write neither “virgin” nor “who was married to a man,” because in that case I would have said that “closely related” comes to exclude the betrothed. Therefore it has to write “who was not married to a man, [which], as Rashi explains above [means that the marriage was consummated], and automatically we also include “struck by a stick.” (@ITGur Aryeh@it and @ITDivrei Dovid@it) You might ask, why is [the phrase] “closely related” [written in the verse dealing with] his sister different such that we expound from it, “to @ITinclude@it the betrothed,” whereas regarding “his kin to whom he is closely related” we @ITexclude@it the betrothed? The Yerushalmi explains that regarding his [the @ITkohein’s@it] betrothed, so long as she has not had @ITnisu’in@it she remains in the house of her father and brothers, and therefore we [expound to] @ITexclude@it her. But regarding his sister, she is [regarded] his close relative until the @ITnisu’in@it [as] she is in the home of her brothers. Therefore, we expound to include [her]. @d1[It is] a [positive] command.@p3 Because before it is written, “Let him not defile himself with the dead among his people. Except to his kin .<TIE>.<TIE>. for his virgin sister<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” This implies that he may defile himself for everyone mentioned. If so, why also write, “For her, he may be defiled”? Therefore, it must be to add a positive command. @p1[5]@p2<TIE>For a deceased person.@p3 As Rashi proves from a @ITgezeroh shovoh.@it @d1So too further on the entire head.@p3 You might ask, perhaps [we should say] the opposite? Just as later [it says] specifically between the eyes, so too regarding @ITkohanim@it it means specifically between the eyes and not the whole head? The answer is that one cannot learn @ITkohanim@it from Israelites in this manner, because the verse here explicitly writes “on their heads,” which implies the entire head. Do not ask that now, how can you learn that regarding Israelites too it means the entire head if the verse writes “between your eyes”? The answer is that it certainly means the entire head, and it only writes “between your eyes” for the purpose of another @ITgezeroh shovoh,@it so that we can learn @ITtefillin@it from it, as it is written, “They will be @ITtotafos@it between your eyes,” so that you do not say it means literally between your eyes. So [to avoid this mistake] we learn a @ITgezeroh shovoh.@it It is written here [regarding @ITtefillin@it], “between your eyes,” and later it is written, “You shall not make any baldness between your eyes.” Just as later it refers to a place where one makes baldness, so regarding @ITtefillin@it it is a place where one makes baldness. Do not ask, how could we think [in our first question] that we should learn @ITkohanim@it from Israelites that [the prohibition of @ITkohanim@it] is specifically between their eyes? If so, why would I need the verse “They shall not make baldness”? Are they not [included in the prohibition of] Israelites? The answer is that you would use [our verse] in order to learn from it that if one made many bald patches at once he is liable for each [instance of making a] bald patch. With all this we have answered the question of @ITRe’m@it. He asks, how the sages could expound: Since it says, “You shall not make any baldness between your eyes,” I would think the prohibition is only between your eyes. From where do we include the entire head? Because the verse says, “On their heads.” [Regarding this @ITRe’m@it asks]: But it is written, “Between your eyes,” And if the verse “on their heads” comes to include the entire head,” why do we explain the verse “between your eyes” [which implies only part of the head]? On the contrary, the sages should expound the opposite, that because it says, “They shall not make baldness on their heads,” I would say it means the entire head. And therefore the verse says “between your eyes” [to tell you], I only said between your eyes! And now you could not object, that it is written “on their head,” because between the eyes is also on their heads, because even part of the heads is called “their heads.” And the reason it writes it again regarding @ITkohanim@it is only because of the superfluous [word] @hh<HEB>קרחה@ee<ENG> written there, to make one liable for every bald patch, etc. @ITRe’m@it left this unanswered; analyze this. @d1Perhaps for plucking with tweezers.@p3 I.e., they should be liable for this as well. [In conclusion] we derive Israelites from @ITKohanim@it to whom the Torah gave more @ITmitzvos,@it and even so, they [@ITkohanim@it] are not liable except for shaving. How much more so an Israelite. @d1To make him liable for each and every gash.@p3 And we learn Israelites from @ITkohanim@it with a @ITgezeroh shovoh.@it But you cannot say that we learn Israelites from @ITkohanim@it through a plain comparison that they are liable for every gash, because you could disprove it, since what [makes @ITkohanim@it liable for every gash]? [The fact] that the Torah added many @ITmitzvos@it for them. Therefore we need the @ITgezeroh shovoh.@it Even though Rashi does not mention this [@ITgezeroh shovoh@it], this is because he relied on his writing the @ITgezeroh shovoh@it of “baldness, baldness” [earlier], and he did not want to be lengthy.   @p1[6]@p2<TIE>The court shall sanctify them against their will.@p3 [@ITRe’m@it explains]: Because it is not written “They (are) holy” (@hh<HEB>קדושים הם@ee<ENG>), but rather, “They shall be holy” (@hh<HEB>קדושים יהיו@ee<ENG>), which indicates [even] against their will. The explanation of his explanation is: @hh<HEB>יהיו@ee<ENG> is in the third person, speaking of the @ITkohanim@it to the @ITbeis din.@it Even though the verse could not say “you shall be” (@hh<HEB>תהיו@ee<ENG>) in the second person because the whole subject is said in the third person, “@ITThey@it shall not make baldness,” “@ITThey@it shall not shave,” etc., nevertheless, it could have said “@ITThey@it (are) holy” (@hh<HEB>קדושים הם@ee<ENG>). This is easy to understand (@ITR. Yaakov Taryosh@it) Even though above (Vayikra 19:2) it says [regarding the Bnei Yisroel], “You shall be holy” (@hh<HEB>קדושים תהיו@ee<ENG>), and there it is not mentioned that this is against their will? The answer seems to be: Above, it first said “You shall be holy” and afterwards explained how they should be holy, by restricting themselves from wives who are forbidden to them. Here, however, it first commanded the @ITkohanim@it about what is forbidden, such as defilement of the dead; if so, what is it adding when it says “They shall be holy,” since “They shall be holy” cannot be an explanation of what came before it [as it adds nothing]. Therefore, Rashi answers that it is an additional command to the @ITbeis din,@it in addition to commanding [the @ITkohanim@it] themselves regarding this. (@ITDivrei Dovid@it) @p1[7]@p2<TIE>Because she had sexual relations in one of the marriages forbidden to a @BIkohein.@p3 For example, a widow [who was married] to a @ITKohein Godol,@it or a @ITchalutzah@it to a regular @ITkohein,@it who becomes profaned from the @ITkehunah.@it She is called profaned even though she was already forbidden to a @ITkohein,@it [since] there is a difference. If a @ITkohein@it had relations with her afterwards, he will be liable for two negative commands, one because of [her being] a widow and a @ITchalutzah,@it and one because of [her being] profane. @p1[8]@p2<TIE>Against his will.@p3 You might ask: Above too in v. 6 it is written “They shall be holy,” [and Rashi explained], “Against their will”? The answer is that above it is saying that regarding the prohibition against become defiled by the dead, the @ITbeis din@it are obligated to separate him against his will. But here it is discussing an invalid woman, and therefore Rashi says here, “For if he does not wish to divorce, beat him<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Even though it already mentioned that the @ITbeis din@it [forces him to be] sanctified him [even] against his will, it seems that the verse says this again so that you do not say that only when he wants to defile himself does the @ITbeis din@it force him to not defile himself, since he is [still] pure. But if he married a woman forbidden to him, I might think that since he is already profaned and considered like a non-@ITkohein,@it we should leave him thus [with her]. So it tells us that the @ITbeis din@it is commanded [to see to it] that he must specifically divorce her. (@ITDivrei Dovid@it) @p1[9]@p2<TIE>When she becomes profaned through fornication.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: The verse implies that she is only burnt if she “began (@hh<HEB>תחל@ee<ENG>) to fornicate” [and was caught immediately]. But if she had already begun to fornicate and no one knew, and the matter only became known later, she is not burnt. But this is not logical! Therefore Rashi explains: “When she becomes @ITprofaned@it through fornication,” and informs us that the word @hh<HEB>תחל@ee<ENG> means “profanity” and not “beginning.” @d1Marital tie (@HB<HEB>זיקת@BO<ENG>) with a husband.@bo @hh<HEB>זיקת@ee<ENG> is an expression of tying. The Targum Yonasan translates (Yeshayahu 60:11) @hh<HEB>ומלכיהם נהוגים @ee<ENG>, “And their kings tied up,” as @hh<HEB>ומלכיהם זקוקין@ee<ENG>. @p1[10]@p2<TIE>It shall not grow wild in mourning.@p3 As we learn from the sons of Aharon where it is written (Vayikra 10:6), “Do not let your hair grow long (@hh<HEB>תפרעו@ee<ENG>),” just as over there [it refers to someone] in mourning, so here [it refers to someone] in mourning. And what is [the definition of] growing [hair] wild? [Leaving it uncut for] more than thirty days as we learn from the [laws of] @ITnazir@it of whom it is written, “He shall let (@hh<HEB>יהיה@ee<ENG>) the hair of his head grow long; the @ITgematria@it of @hh<HEB>יהיה@ee<ENG> is thirty. @p1[11]@p2<TIE>A tent [which is over a] dead body.@p3 I.e., because it is written “he shall not enter,” and entering is not applicable except into something that has an interior. @d1A quarter of blood.@p3 It seems that Rashi infers this from Scripture’s writing “souls” in the plural, and “dead body” in the singular., as iI It should have said either “the soul of a dead body,” or “the souls of dead bodies.” Thus it is saying that one body can impart impurity similar to that of many souls, and this is [through] the quarter [of a @hh<HEB>לוג@ee<ENG>] of blood, since each quarter [of a @hh<HEB>לוג@ee<ENG>] from a corpse imparts impurity, and one can call it “soul” as the soul rests in a quarter [of a @hh<HEB>לוג@ee<ENG>] of a person. And this is easy to understand. (@ITR. Yaakov Taryosh@it) You might ask: In @ITparshas@it Chukas (Bamidbar 19:13) it is also written, @hh<HEB>במת בנפש@ee<ENG>, “a corpse,” and Rashi writes, “’Of a [human] soul’ refers to a quarter [of a @hh<HEB>לוג@ee<ENG>] of blood.” Why do we need two verses [to teach this lesson]? The answer is: Here it is speaking of a case where it caused impurity in a tent, and there it is speaking of a case where it caused impurity though contact. @d1To permit him [to become impure] for a @BImeis mitzvoh.@bo Because Scripture has already written, “Adjacent to any dead body he shall not enter,” which must be teaching that he may not become impure even for his father and mother. Because if it meant for other people, this would be obvious as even a regular @ITkohein@it is prohibited as it is written (verse 1), “Let him not defile himself with the dead.” Therefore, “Adjacent to any dead body he shall not enter,” must be coming to prohibit a corpse [for whom] a regular @ITkohein@it is permitted [to defile himself], e.g., his father and mother. But if so, why do we need [the verse], “for his father and mother he shall not become [ritually] impure”? We must certainly need it [for the following]: If the Torah did not write “his father and his mother,” we would think that since the verse “Let him not defile himself, etc.,” prohibits the @ITKohein Godol@it doing even that which is permitted to the regular @ITkohein,@it and earlier the Torah permitted [the regular @ITkohein@it to become impure for] a @ITmeis mitzvah@it and for his father and mother, whereas here regarding the @ITKohein Godol@it the Torah forbids everything, we would then think that even for a @ITmeis mitzvah@it it is forbidden for him to become impure. Therefore the verse repeats and writes, “For his father and his mother he shall not become [ritually] impure,” [to teach us that] for his father and mother he may not become impure, but for a @ITmeis mitzvah@it he may become impure. So I found. @p1[12]@p2<TIE>May offer [a sacrifice] while he is an @BIonein.@p3 Explanation: We derive this from theis verse, “H@eee shall not profane his God’s Sanctuary.” You cannot say we derive this from “He shall not depart (from the Sanctuary),” [because] how could we derive these two teachings from this verse? The teaching that “he does not follow the bier” implies both during the Temple service and not during the service, whereas according to the second teaching, the verse has to be explained [as speaking of] during the service, [whereas not during the service he should follow the bier]. @p1[14]@p2<TIE>Born of [a marriage] forbidden to the @BIkehunoh.@p3 You might ask: Rashi already explained this above (verse 7)? Furthermore, if Rashi wanted also to explain [the verse] here as well, he should have also mentioned the second explanation [of profaned woman as] he explained above, and also explained the word “harlot” written here. The answer is: he has to explain the meaning of “profaned woman” here, since you may have thought the case is specifically that she was invalidated from @ITkehunoh@it through having sexual relations with one of those people forbidden to @ITkehunoh,@it i.e., even if the relations were unnatural [and she remained a virgin according to the opinion of Rabbi Meir (see Yevamos 59a)]. But [you may have thought that] a virgin born from someone invalidated from @ITkehunah@it would not be considered a profane woman, since the verse specifically writes @hh<HEB>חללה זונה@ee<ENG>, which implies, a profane woman who is [also] a harlot. [You might think this] because preceding this, the verse wrote @hh<HEB>אלמנה וגרושה@ee<ENG> (“a widow and a divorcee), which implies a widow @ITor@it a divorcee. If so, here [too] it should have written @hh<HEB>וזונה@ee<ENG> (and a harlot), which would have implied “@ITor@it a harlot.” Therefore, because it writes “harlot” without a @hh<HEB>ו@ee<ENG>, this implies that she is a profaned woman who is also a harlot. Therefore, Rashi has to explain that [a daughter] “born of [a marriage] forbidden to the @ITkehunoh@it” is also considered a profaned woman, and that the word “harlot” is not connected with the word “profane woman.” The reason Scripture does not write “and a profaned woman @ITand@it a harlot,” is because it is normal for verses to write in this way. For example, above (verse 2) [it says], “Except to his kin to whom he is closely related, for his mother and his father,” it should have said “@ITand@it for his mother.” @p1[15]@p2<TIE>Profaned from the status of the holiness of the @BIkehunoh@BO.@p3 I.e., his male children are permitted to become impure, to marry a divorcee, and anything similar. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1[17]@p2<TIE>The food.@p3 You might ask: Why does Rashi not explain this above in v. 6 where it says, “T@eehe bread of their God they bring, and they must be holy?” The answer is that above you could say that when the verse mentions bread, etc., it is referring to the show bread that was in the sanctuary. But here, where it says “shall not approach to offer,” why do we need [the extra word] “to offer?” Thus, it must be dealing with all the offerings offered on the altar, and therefore he has to explain, “Every food [meal]<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1[18]@p2<TIE>It is not proper that he approach.@p3 Because if not so, what reason is the verse giving when it says (verse 17) “Shall not approach<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. For any man who has a blemish shall not approach.” What is the verse adding with this? Therefore he explains, “It is not proper.” (@ITR. Yaakov Taryosh@it) @d1Both his eyes with one stroke.@p3 Explanation: his nose is sunk close to his eyes so that when he wants to paint both of his eyes, his nose does not prevent him from painting them both together with one stroke. @d1Longer.@p3 You might ask: This is the same as being lame. The answer is that lameness is when his limbs are like everyone else except that one thigh is shorter, while “disproportionate” is the opposite, all his limbs are like everyone else except that one thigh is longer. The expression of @hh<HEB>שרוע@ee<ENG> is similar to, “For the bed is too short to stretch oneself out (@hh<HEB>מהשתרע@ee<ENG>)” (Yeshayahu 28:20). @p1[20]@p2<TIE>Snake, wart.@p3 I.e., he has the form of a snail, or the form of a snake, or something like the pit of a grape in his eyes. Some have the text, “worm, snake, his eyes,” meaning that he has the form of a snail or snake in his eyes. Some say that @hh<HEB>ענב@ee<ENG> is an expression of @hh<HEB>עניבה@ee<ENG> (coil), because it is the way of the snake to coil itself and @hh<HEB>עניבה@ee<ENG> is an expression of coiling. All [the versions] mean the same, [i.e., that he has some kind of a streak in his eye]. @HB<HEB>מריס פחדין@ee<ENG>. @hh<HEB>פחדין@ee<ENG> means testicles. @p1[21]@p2<TIE>To include other blemishes.@p3 Because if not so, why does it repeat “Any man who has a blemish” a second time? It is already written above (verse 17), “Anyone of your offspring, through [all] their generations who will have a blemish, etc.”@ee @d1Every food.@p3 You might ask: Rashi already explained this above (verse 17)? Furthermore, here he [only] explains “every food,” while above he [also] explained “the food of his God?” The answer is: Above he is talking about the daily sacrifices that are called bread as it says, “My food [lit. bread] of My fires” (Bamidbar 28:2). But here he is talking about the most holy sacrifices, which one may have thought are not called bread. Therefore, he explains, “@ITEvery@it food is called bread.” [See @ITRe’m@it] @p1[22]@p2<TIE>I would have thought: A blemished person may eat of the most holy sacrifices.@p3 (@ITGur Aryeh@it) @ITRe’m@it raises a question regarding Rashi’s statement that the holy sacrifices were permitted to a non-@ITkohein@it: The Gemara in @ITPerek Tevul Yom@it (Zevachim 101b) says@IT,@it Moshe, our teacher, was a @ITKohein Godol@it and took a portion of the sacrifices of Heaven as it says concerning the ram of inauguration (Vayikra 8:29), “That was the portion of Moshe.” If so, [where is the proof that] it was not permitted to a non-@ITkohein@it? This is no difficulty, since it is still correct to say that it was permitted to a non-@ITkohein,@it i.e., to someone whose sons were not @ITkohanim.@it Also, Moshe was not a @ITkohein@it regarding everything, as he was not permitted to do service after the Tabernacle was erected, and concerning this he is called a non-@ITkohein.@it @p1[23]@p2<TIE>To sprinkle seven sprinklings.@p3 Because if not so, what has he to do with the Curtain that the verse should warn him from entering there. @d1The outer [one].@p3 You might ask: How does Rashi know this? Perhaps it is the inner altar? The answer is: If it was speaking about the inner altar, there would be no need to write, “H@eee may not enter beyond the Curtain,” because if he is forbidden to approach the inner altar which is outside the Curtain, he would certainly not be permitted to approach the curtain. But if it is speaking of the outer altar, “both had to be written, and [the reason] is explained, etc.”<QC>
@d1His service is profaned.@p3 I.e., @hh<HEB>מקדשי@ee<ENG> of the verse does not mean the actual Temple, but rather His service, because the word @hh<HEB>מקדש@ee<ENG> can refer to the actual Temple and also to the service performed in the Temple. @p1[24]@p2<TIE>To warn the court.@p3 Because if not so, what have Yisroel to do with the warning of the @ITkohanim@it? @p1[2]@p2<TIE>Reverse the verse.@p3 I.e., “And let them keep away from the holy offerings of Bnei Yisroel which they sanctify for Me.”@ee But not as the verse is written. If you do not reverse the verse, and “which they sanctify for Me” is written after “and they shall not profane,” and “which they sanctify for Me” comes “to include the holy offerings of the @ITkohanim@it themselves,” as Rashi soon explains, the verse would be unclear. Because we could explain that the negative command of “and they shall not profane” also refers to “which they sanctify for Me [i.e., the sacrifices of the @ITkohanim@it].” On the other hand [we could explain that] if “which they sanctify to Me” refers [only] to “I am Hashem,” and that the verse means as follows: “And let them keep away from the holy offerings of Bnei Yisroel and they shall not profane My holy name.” However, regarding those “which they sanctify for Me [i.e., the @ITkohein’s@it own sacrifices], I am Hashem,” [ready] to punish them, but they will not transgress [the negative command of] “they shall not profane, etc.” (@ITRe’m@it). But I discovered in a corrected text that the words “another alternative interpretation” in Rashi’s text above [in the text of Sifsei Chochomim, the words “another alternative interpretation” appeared just before our current Rashi], are a copyist’s error and one should move the words “another alternative interpretation” below. And this is the [correct] text: “They shall separate [themselves] from holy things in the days of their impurity. ’And let them keep away from the holy offerings, etc., and not profane My Holy Name.’ Reverse the verse and expound it. An alternative interpretation. ’Which (they sanctify for Me), etc.’.” I heard that this [alternative interpretation] should be explained as follows: According to the first interpretation, Rashi is explaining that [the phrase] “And let them keep away from the holy offerings of Bnei Yisroel” refers to days when [a @ITkohein@it] is impure. But according to the alternative interpretation where Rashi explains “They shall separate themselves” [in a new way], he means that the verse [“which they sanctify for Me”] is referring to an animal that was sanctified for a sacrifice. The @ITkohanim@it are commanded not to not eat them but to offer them on the altar. [The verse says this] so that you do not say, since sacrifices are permitted to @ITkohanim@it after their organs [of the animal] have been sacrificed, if so, once an animal has been sanctified, it too should be permitted [immediately]. Therefore the Torah commands against this. This is why Rashi reverses the verse and expounds it as if it is written, “And let them keep away from the holy offerings of Bnei Yisroel, which they sanctify for Me,” so that [according to the alternative interpretation, the verse] is referring to a person declaring [that an animal is] sanctified [as an offering, and is commanding the @ITkohanim@it not to not eat such an animal before it is sacrificed]. @p1[3]@p2<TIE>From a @BIgezeroh shovoh.@bo This is according to our text. The text should be amended to read But “oOur sages actually learned it from a @IThekesh@it: Is then a @ITkohein@it who [merely] touches [sacrificial flesh when he is unclean] liable [to @ITkoreis@it]? If so, etc., i.e., if he was liable for touching, the verse would not have to make him liable for eating. Therefore one has to say that the [words] “drawing near” [inof our verse] means “eating”. You might ask: Why not say that “draw near” means touching, and regarding your question that if so, the verses in [the parshah] @ITTzav es Aharon@it should not have mentioned eating, [you could answer] that the verses [there] neededs [to mention eating] as one might have said that we do not derive punishment from a @ITkal vachomer.@it The answer is: We do not derive punishment from a @ITkal vachomer@it only with regard to human punishments, but regarding Divine punishment, we derive punishment from a @ITkal vachomer.@it @d1Unless that which makes it permissible is offered.@p3 Meaning, he is not liable unless they offered that which permits the sacrifice to be eaten. I.e., [the burning of] the fat and the sprinkling of the blood. @d1And if you say: Why are there three @BIkerisos@BO.@p3 Rashi is saying as follows: I explained earlier, “Since @ITkoreis@it is mentioned regarding eating in [the parshah] @ITTzav es Aharon:@it Two @ITkerisos@it are [mentioned] next to one each another, and if he is liable, etc.” This implies that the [word] @ITkoreis@it here too is also speaking about eating. But if so, the question is even greater — why mention three @ITkerisos@it? Why does Rashi only ask this question here, after explaining that the drawing near means eating? The answer is: Had he not said this, he could have answered that the three @ITkerisos@it are [necessary], one to prohibit eating, one to prohibit touching, and one @ITkoreis@it for someone who eats it before that which makes it permissible has been offered. But now that Rashi explained that one is not liable for touching, but only liable after that which makes it permissible is offered, the question arises: why are three @ITkerisos@it mentioned? @d1Passes away from him.@p3 Since the verse writes “on him,” this implies that the impurity is still on him as he has not yet become purified. Because if it referred to the meat which cannot be purified in a @ITmikveh,@it the verse should have said “and it @ITis@it impure” implying that it cannot be purified from its impurity.<QC>
@p1[5]@p2<TIE>A lentil.@p3 Otherwise Scripture should have written only “Anyone who touches any creeping creature,” and nothing more. Why does it write “that causes impurity to him@ee”? So that you do not say that [he is impure] only if he touched a complete creeping creature. @d1A dead body.@p3 You might ask: Impurity imparted by a dead body requires seven days [for the person to become pure], yet here it is written that one only requires for the sun to set [for the person to become pure, which is] like the impurity imparted by a creeping creature where it is written, “He will be impure until the evening”? The answer is that we are only deriving [the law of] the impurity imparted by a dead body from [the law of] the impurity imparted by a creeping creature regarding the necessity for the sun to set. So that you do not say that once as soon as the seventh day begins he is pure, [on the basis] that part of the day is considered the whole day. I found this. @d1An olive’s-bulk.@p3 Otherwise, why write “Which causes uncleanness to him”? This would [already] be implied in “Any person .<TIE>.<TIE>. [with] whatever impurity he has.”<FJ> @d1This includes one who touches a @BIzov@BO.@p3 Even though this is not the uncleanness imparted by the dead that the verse is discussing, nonetheless it is included in “whatever impurity he has,” since all these are human impurities. @p1[6]@p2<TIE>Any of these [ritually] unclean [persons].@p3 I.e., the verse should have said, “Anyone touching them.” @p1[7]@p2<TIE>@BITerumah.@p3 Explanation: This [verse that writes] “@ITof@it the holy things” and [not] “all holy things,” implying only some holy things, is speaking about the holy @ITterumah.@it  @p1[8]@p2<TIE>Regarding the matter of uncleanness.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: The Torah already wrote [this prohibition earlier], “An animal which has died on its own, or an animal that was fatally maimed, he must not eat,” [earlier, verse (11:40)]? When Rashi writes, “[This verse] warns regarding the matter of uncleanness, etc.,” he means that this prohibition does not pertain to its eating but to its imparting impurity, telling us “That if he ate, etc.” Regarding what he says, “Except for the uncleanness [caused by] eating as soon as it is in the gullet,” see above in @ITparshas@it Acharei Mos (17:15) in the verse “that will eat an improperly slaughtered animal.” @d1Which has no [rule of] uncleanness of touch.@p3 You might ask: Why does Rashi mention that it does not impart uncleanness [of touch]? He should have [only] said that if one eats the carcass of a ritually clean bird, he gets the uncleanness caused by eating as soon as it is in the gullet? The answer is: Rashi wants to prove his statement that the verse is talking about the carcass of a ritually pure bird, and not about the carcass of an animal: Since in the verse it is written “An animal which has died on its own, or an animal that was fatally maimed, he must not eat to defile himself with it,” [this indicates specifically] eating. I.e., [the creature spoken of] imparts uncleanness only through eating and not through touching or carrying. But if it was talking about the carcass of an animal, this it would also impart uncleanness through touching and carrying! This problem is resolved if the verse is talking about the carcass of a ritually pure bird, since it imparts uncleanness only through eating. If one ate the carcass of a ritually clean bird, the carcass does not impart uncleanness by touching and carrying. It only imparts uncleanness by eating when it enters the person’s gullet. @p1[9]@p2<TIE>Not to eat.@p3 Explanation: “They shall keep” is referring to [what is written] earlier where it was discussing @ITterumah,@it as Rashi explained above. @d1At the hands of Heaven.@p3 @ITRe’m@it asks: From where do we derive that this is death at the hands of Heaven? Is there not a rule that every death mentioned in the Torah without specification is [death by] strangulation? He leaves this question unanswered. The answer is: The death spoken of here must be at the hand of Heaven, because @ITkodshim@it are more severe than @ITterumah,@it since [unlike @ITterumah@it] @ITkodshim@it are forbidden [for someone who went to @ITmikveh@it for his impurity] to be eaten @ITkodshim@it at [after] sunset. Yet even so, if someone ate @ITkodshim@it when ohine’s body was impure, heone is not liable for death at by the hand of man, because we derive the eating of @ITkodshim@it from entering of the Sanctuary with a @IThekesh,@it as stated above in @ITparshas@it Ki Tazria (12:4). And entering the Temple in a state of impurity is punished by @ITkoreis@it as it is written (Bamidbar 12:20), “That soul will be cut off from the community; for he defiled the Sanctuary of Hashem.” [If so], how much more is the lenient @ITterumah@it not be liable for death by the hand of man. Another answer is: Rashi explained earlier in @ITparshas@it Ki Tazria (ibid), that [the words] “anything holy” come to include @ITterumah.@it This indicates that the death mentioned in @ITterumah@it is @ITkoreis,@it similar to [the punishment for] eating @ITkodshim.@it Another answer is that the verse indicates this by writing “And die because of it, etc., I am Hashem.” Why add “I am Hashem”? This must refer to the beginning of the verse where it states “And die because of it, etc.,” and it means, “I am Hashem,” Who will surely punish and kill him. This is death by the hand of Heaven. @p1[10]@p2<TIE>Or his hired hand.@p3 Explanation: Not that the indentured person and the hired hand are @ITkohanim,@it because cshould [you think that] someone who belongs [to ahis master] for [a period of] years lose his @ITkehunah@it? @d1Who leaves [his master’s service] in six years.@p3 You might ask: If so, the verse should [only] write the indentured person who does not eat @ITterumah@it even though he belongs to [his master] until the Jubilee year, and then Scripture would not have to write that the hired hand may not eat since [it would be obvious since] he goes out [free] after six years? The answer is: If it did not mention the hired hand, we would say that the verse is speaking of the most likely case. [Thus] we would think that @hh<HEB>תושב@ee<ENG> is somebody who belongs [to his master] for [a period of] years and goes out after six years, and this is why he does not eat. But the one [who had his ear] pierced who belongs to him until the Jubilee year may eat @ITterumah.@it Therefore the verse needs [to mention] the indentured person and the hired hand. @p1[11]@p2<TIE>A Canaanite slave.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: The previous verse implies that a [slave’s] body does not belong to the master, yet here it is written, “If a @ITkohein@it shall purchase@ee .<TIE>.<TIE>. ?” He answers that the verse above is speaking of a Hebrew slave, while here it is speaking of a Canaanite slave. @d1And [this law] is also learned from another verse.@p3 There is a reason for these two sources. If [we would learn only] from here [where it says] “his monetary possession,” I might think that only his wife [may eat], but his @ITyevamah@it may not eat as she is not his @hh<HEB>קנין כספו@ee<ENG> [lit. brought with his money]. Rather, Hheaven gave this wife to him as a possession [without the second husband giving her any money]. Thus “in your house” informs you [that she too eats @ITterumah@it], because his @ITyevamah@it is also regarded as “your house.” And if [we would learn] only from there, you might think that only a @ITnesu’ah@it [may eat] because she is “his house,” but not an @ITarusah.@it Therefore “his monetary possession@ee” teaches us [that an @ITarusah@it too also eats @ITterumah@it]. (@ITGur Aryeh@it) @p1[12]@p2<TIE>To a Levite or an Israelite.@p3 Rashi is answering the [following] question: that It is obvious that she has to marry an @hh<HEB>איש זר@ee<ENG> (lit. a nonrelative), because she is forbidden to relatives. He answers that regarding her, a Levite or an Israelite are considered a @hh<HEB>זר@ee<ENG>. [See @ITRe’m@it] @p1[13]@p2<TIE>From him.@p3 I.e., even if she has children from another person who is a @ITkohein,@it even stillso she may not eat [@ITterumah@it] if she has children from him. [See @ITRe’m@it] @d1She is forbidden.@p3 Even though this is obvious, Rashi needs to mention this here since the Torah’s [actual] intent is only to tell us the prohibition, and not to tell us the a leniency as one would [normally] [implied by the simple] understanding of the verse. It is as if the verse said, “If a @ITkohein’s@it daughter is either widowed, etc., and she has children from him, she may not eat @ITterumah.@it” [See @ITRe’m@it] @d1The children live.@p3 But after his death she returns [to her father’s home]. Even though with regard to @ITyibum@it, if her husband died and afterward her child died, the child is considered as living and she is no longer [considered] attached for @ITyibum@it. Nonetheless, with regard to terumah, if her son child died [after she was widowed or divorced], she returns [to her father’s home] and the child is not considered as living, for it is written, “she has no children” as explained in Yevamos chapter 7. @p1[14]@p2<TIE>@BITerumah@BO.@p3 Because the whole @ITparshah@it is talking about @ITterumah.@it Not like @ITRe’m@it who explains that [this is derived from] a @ITgezeroh shovoh@it of “holy,” “holy,” because regarding divestment (@hh<HEB>ביעור@ee<ENG>) it is written, “I have divested my estate of sacred (holy) material” (Devarim 26:13). [See @ITRe’m@it] @d1Fit to become holy.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Since he has already eaten the @ITterumah@it because he has to pay, so how can it write, “And give to the @ITkohein@it the holy thing”? @p1[16]@p2<TIE>And Onkelos who translated “in their eating, etc.”@bo Explanation: Onkelos seems to think that “They shall not profane” refers to above [verse 2], “And let them keep away from the holy offerings of Bnei Yisroel.” I.e., they [@ITkohanim@it] should be careful with @ITterumah,@it not to profane it and thereby burden themselves with sin by eating it in impurity. Therefore, Rashi writes that this is unnecessary since it is possible to explain that “they shall not profane” refers to the prohibition not to of feeding it to non-@ITkohanim. Re’m@it<QC>
@ee @p1[18]@p2<TIE>“I am obligated.”@bo I.e., if he [then] set aside [an animal for this vow] and the animal was lost before it was sacrificed, he is obligated to make restitution. @d1Behold, this.@p3 And if it was lost he is not obligated to make restitution.<QC>
@p1[21]@p2<TIE>By his speech.@p3 [Rashi says this] so that you do not think that if he [merely] thought in his heart to bring a vowed [sacrifice], he must bring the vowed [sacrifice]. Therefore Rashi explains, “To express, etc.” You might ask: Nevertheless, why does Rashi say “by his speech,” once he already explained “to express” obviously it implies speech? The answer is: You might have thought he [only] expressed [the word] “animal” [and mentally thought whether it would be a vow or a free-will-offering], and thus, [according to this premise], there would be no [verbal] difference between a vow and a free-will-offering. Therefore Rashi explains [that he expresses everything] “by his speech,” [and his obligation depends on] whether he [actually] says “I am obligated [to bring this sacrifice],” or “Behold, this [I will bring].”<QC>
@p1[22]@p2<TIE>[This is] the noun.@p3 Explanation: @hh<HEB>עורת@ee<ENG> is not the adjective of a female [noun], i.e., a blind animal, because [in] this whole subject [of blemishes, the adjectives are] expressed in the masculine form. Rather, it is a noun like @ITivaron@it (blindness), excepting that @ITivaron@it is a masculine term and @hh<HEB>עורת@ee<ENG> is a feminine term. It is as if the verse said, “The blemish of blindness shall not be in it” (@ITGur Aryeh@it). @ITGur Aryeh@it means that @hh<HEB>עורת@ee<ENG> cannot be the adjective of “animal,” because if so @hh<HEB>שבורה@ee<ENG> (broken-limbed) too should have been feminine. Rather it is a noun, like @ITtzedakah@it and @ITtzedek@it [righteousness] that both have the same meaning. @d1It shall not be.@bo Rashi does not write “it shall not have [the blemish of] broken-limbed” as he wrote concerning blindness, because @hh<HEB>שבור@ee<ENG> (broken-limbed) is an adjective, i.e., the sacrifice shall not be broken-limbed. Therefore it is suitable to write that “it shall not be” [broken-limbed]. But regarding the noun of @hh<HEB>עורון@ee<ENG> (blindness) it is suitable to write “It shall not have.” I.e., it shall not have the blemish of blindness. @d1A type of lichen.@p3 Why does Rashi explain here what he already explained by [in the section of] the blemishes of a @ITkohein@it? Because since the Torah lists here blemishes that are not mentioned over there, one may have thought that these [too] are blemishes [sharing the same names] that were not mentioned there. (@ITKitzur Mizrachi@it) @p1[23]@p2<TIE>Whose hooves are uncloven.@p3 I.e., an animal that has cloven hooves, except that the hoof of one foot is uncloven and not cloven like the others. Instead, its foot is like that of a horse or donkey. @d1Dedicated for the altar.@p3 With this Rashi is answering the question: How do we know that “You shall make it as a free-will-offering” means “for the repair of the Temple,” and that “For [the fulfillment of] a vow” means “for the altar”? Perhaps it is the opposite? He answers: “What dedicated thing .<TIE>.<TIE>. Say: this is the dedicated [animal intended] for the altar.” Therefore, since “it will not be favorably accepted” refers to the altar, then “you shall make it as a free-will-offering@ee” obviously refers to dedication “for the repair of the temple.” @ITRe’m@it explains that since most freewill-offerings are for the repair of the temple, and most vows are for the altar, the Torah therefore refers to repair of the house as a “freewill-offering, and to the altar [sacrifices] as a “vow.” @p1[24]@p2<TIE>But they are still in the pouch.@p3 It is written in the name of @ITMoreinu Harav Hendel@it that if they were cut off completely with the pouch and the pouch was missing, this would obviously invalidate it, because even for a bird and for non-Jews it is invalid. So how could can [the sages] say that [non-Jews] are permitted [to offer such animals on] altars in the fields? (@ITDivrei Dovid@it) @d1To castrate.@p3  It cannot mean that you should not offer a @eecrushed and mangled [animal] in your land [whereas elsewhere you can], because sacrifices are not offered outside the land. Therefore “you shall not do this thing” refers only to castration. @d1Even a [ritually] unclean one.@p3 Explanation: You cannot say that “And in your land you shall not inflict” means that they need only observe the prohibition against castration in the land and not outside the land, and that [therefore] it does not come to include everything in your land, even including unclean animals, because [the prohibition against] castration is an obligation [pertaining to] the person and it is not dependent upon the land. Perforce [“in your land”] comes to include even an unclean animal. (@ITRe’m@it) @p1[25]@p2<TIE>A blemished [animal].@p3 Explanation: Specifically concerning the offering of an individual, if [a gentile] brings it to a @ITkohein@it to sacrifice we only refuse to accept blemished [animals]. But if they are nonblemished we accept them as Rashi explains, “’Any man’ — to include non-Jews.” [But concerning public communal sacrifices, a gentile may not contribute to them at all even if the animal has no blemish]. But if they [the offerings of an individual brought by a gentile] are non-blemished we accept them as Rashi explains, “’Any man’ — to include non-Jews.” In the first chapter of Chullin (13) Tosfos asks: Why do we need “any man” to include non-Jews? Derive it from the verse, “And from a stranger’s [non-Jew’s] hand you shall not bring (offer) the bread of your God from any of these,” i.e., blemished animals, which indicates that we may accept non-blemished animals from them? Tosfos answers: One may have thought [that sacrificing their] blemished animal incurs a negative and positive commandment, and [that sacrificing] a non-blemished animal nevertheless incurs a prohibition. Therefore “any man” informs us [otherwise]. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @d1To atone for you.@p3 Explanation: Since @hh<HEB>לא ירצו לכם@ee<ENG> indicates that “they are not acceptable for you,” the word “for you” is inappropriate unless one adds the word “to atone.” Rashi also alters the word @hh<HEB>לכם@ee<ENG> to @hh<HEB>עליכם@ee<ENG> (for you), because the word atonement is only used in conjunction with the word @hh<HEB>על@ee<ENG>, such as in the verse “And it will be favorably accepted from him to atone for him (@hh<HEB>לכפר עליו@ee<ENG>)” (above 1:4). @p1[28]@p2<TIE>The mother [together with] the son or daughter.@p3 We derive this from the sending away [of the mother bird from] the nest as [we derive other things from the mother bird] later below [in the next S.C.]. Just as over there females are also included because it says “on the fledglings” which includes both males and females, here too, it makes no difference whether they are males or females. @d1And it is permitted to slaughter the father and the son.@p3 We derive this by comparing this case to the sending away [of the mother bird from] the nest. The mitzvah of “it and its offspring” applies to parents and offspring, and the mitzvah of sending away [from] the nest applies to parents and offspring. Just as over there it [only applies] to offspring and a mother as it is written “And the mother is sitting,” so here [it only applies to] offspring and a mother. You might ask that it should have said @hh<HEB>אותה ואת בנה@ee<ENG>, “she and her offspring”? The answer is that since it is written earlier, “an ox or a lamb” in the male gender, therefore Scripture also writes the adjacent @hh<HEB>אותו ואת בנו@ee<ENG>, [lit.] “he and his son” in the male gender. @d1Even its offspring and it.@p3 I.e., if one slaughtered the offspring before it, one is also liable since @hh<HEB>לא תשחטו@ee<ENG> [“you shall not slaughter” in the plural] implies that there is a case where two slaughterers are liable, both the one who slaughtered the mother and the one who slaughtered the daughter. Where do we find such a case? The case must be that there are three cows, a daughter, a mother, and a granddaughter, and the first [slaughterer] is always exempt. You cannot say the case is that one person slaughtered the mother and the two other people each slaughtered a daughter, because in that case it would be obvious that the last two are liable as both are [cases of] “it and its offspring.” Thus the case must certainly be that one person slaughtered a cow, and one person [then] slaughtered its mother and is liable, and another person slaughtered its daughter. Why is the person who slaughtered the mother liable when the first person had slaughtered its daughter beforehand? This indicates that one is also liable when the offspring is slaughtered before the mother. You need not ask: Perhaps [the Torah writes] @hh<HEB>תשחטו@ee<ENG> so that you do not think that only if one person slaughtered [both] it and its offspring is he liable, but if one person slaughtered the mother and another person slaughtered the offspring he would not be liable, and therefore it writes @hh<HEB>תשחטו@ee<ENG>, [to teach] that even though one person slaughtered the mother and a second person slaughtered the offspring, the second person is liable. Because if so, the Torah should have said @hh<HEB>לא ישחט@ee<ENG> (“it shall not be slaughtered”), [see @ITRe’m@it]. This is easy to understand. (@ITRav Yaakov Taryosh@it). @p1[29]@p2<TIE>Again detailed.@p3 In @ITparshas@it Tzav (above7:18) where it says, “If it will be eaten, of the flesh of the peace-offering on the third day, it will not be favorably accepted.” [The verse] again detailed [it here], regarding [those] eaten for one day. Because the peace offerings mentioned here are peace offerings that are eaten for one day. @p1[31]@p2<TIE>This [refers] to study.@p3 I.e., to study and preserve all the mitzvos in one’s heart, and afterwards “[you shall] fulfill” what that which is preserved in the heart. Because For actionperformance always follows thought, i.e., what is preserved in the heart. @p1[32]@p2<TIE>To transgress My words.@p3 I.e., if someone wants to cause you to transgress the Torah, do not listen to him to transgress My words. @d1Surrender yourself.@p3 Without [Rashi’s previous comment] I would say that one [phrase, “You shall not profane My holy Name”] refers to inadvertent sin, and one [phrase, “I will be sanctified among Bnei Yisroel”] refers to deliberate sin, and the [purpose of the] verse is to instructing us to be careful to avoid both severe, intentional sins, and also less severe sins, unintentional sins. But now that Rashi explained that the phrase [“to transgress My words”] is speaking of intentional sins, why do I need [the words] “I will be sanctified among Bnei Yisroel?” I think Rashi means as follows: Since “You shall not profane My holy Name” means that one should not transgress My words intentionally but observe them, why does the Torah need to write “I will be sanctified,” [commanding us to sanctify] Hashem and to observe themHis words?. Is this not obvious, since the opposite of to sanctify is to profane? Rather, the verse means as follows: Even if you can avoid transgressing and profaning [My name], even so, [you must] surrender yourself and sanctify [My Name]. And since it is forbidden to just avoid [profaning Hashem’s Name] but rather one must surrender himself [to sanctify Hashem’s Name], one should therefore surrender himself to death, since by surrendering himself to death he is sanctifying the Name. But if one surrenders himself [to death] relying on a miracle to occur, it is not considered as though he is surrendering himself to death, and this is not a sanctification of the Name. Thus Rashi concludes, “’Who brought you out’ — for this purpose,” i.e., so that you surrender yourself to death without relying for a miracle to occur. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1[33]@p2<TIE>Faithful to give reward.@p3 Rashi writes this so that you should not say: Since Rashi just said that He took us out of Egypt for this purpose, if so this mitzvah does not have a reward., for wWe are obligated to fulfill it, since He took us out of Egypt for this purpose. So he [Rashi] tells us [that this is not so]. (@ITDivrei Dovid@it) The Torah writes this here so that one should not say: Once a person surrenders himself to death and is killed he will no longer be able to fulfill mitzvos, so better that he profane the Name of Heaven once [and not allow himself to be killed] in order that he will fulfill the entire Torah [later]! Therefore it says, “I am Hashem,” faithful to give reward in the World to Come and at the Resurrection of the Dead [and will consider it] as if he had fulfilled the entire Torah. (@ITKitzur Mizrachi@it in the name of @ITMoreinu Harav Hendel@it) @p1[2]@p2<TIE>That [the Sanhedrin] proclaims a leap year.@p3 This is the correct text: “Regulate the appointed times so that [the] Israel[ites] should become knowledgeable in them,” i.e., they should become used to coming up [to Jerusalem] on the festivals. He then explains how [it is regulated]. “[The Sanhedrin] proclaims a leap year, etc.” Since the [people]y were uprooted from their place they [Sanhedrin] proclaim a leap year, because if they do not proclaim a leap year, they [people] will be unable to come up and reach Jerusalem until after the festival., and t The following year they will not want to come up for the festival, thinking that that they will be unable to reach Jerusalem before the festival. Therefore they proclaim a leap year. See Sanhedrin 11a. @p1[4]@p2<TIE>Sanctification of the month.@p3 I.e., above (in verse 2) it is written, “The appointed times of Hashem, which you shall proclaim them” (@hh<HEB>תקראו אֹתם@ee<ENG>)@ee, and we [expound the word and] read it as @hh<HEB>אתם@ee<ENG> (you). I.e., everything depends on @ITbeis din@it; if they proclaim a leap year it is a leap year, and if not, it is not a leap year. And here too it is written, “The appointed times of Hashem, the holy assemblies that you shall proclaim them (@hh<HEB>אֹתם@ee<ENG>),” which implies that it depends on @ITbeis din,@it if they sanctify [the month] it is sanctified, and if not it is not sanctified. @p1[5]@p2<TIE>From six hours onward.@p3 I.e., from the beginning of the day until six hours [midday], the day is brightest. And from six hours onwards it is less bright than before, therefore from six [hours] onwards is called evening. The real evening is when night approaches and it becomes very dark. Thus the entire period from immediately after six hours [into the day] onwards until nightfall is called “between the evenings.” @d1The sacrifice whose name is Pesach.@p3 Because “Pesach” refers not to the festival, but to “the bringing, etc.”<QC>
@p1[8]@p2<TIE>@BISeteyne @BOin Old French.@p3 In other words, @hh<HEB>שבעה@ee<ENG> is like an adjective describing a group of seven tangible objects, whether animals, plants or inanimate objects, whereas @hh<HEB>שבעת@ee<ENG> refers to a group of seven that is removed from something tangible, such as power or wisdom which are not intangible. Unlike “the strong person” or “the wise person,” which indicate a connection [of strength or wisdom] to something physical. Afterwards the verse explains that the group [implied by the abstract seven] consists of days. See @ITparshas@it Bo (Shemos 12:15). @d1Perhaps even [during] the intermediate days of the festival.@p3 It answers [this query by saying] that whatever any activity which [would] incurs a loss [if it were not done at that time] is permitted [to be performed] onduring the intermediate days of the festival. This implies that on the festival itself, even that something which incurs a monetary loss [if it is not done] is forbidden. @p1[10]@p2<TIE>The first of the harvest.@p3 I.e., Jews may not reap their fields until the @ITomer@it is reaped first, [before]of all everything else that is being reaped. But Rashi is not saying that @hh<HEB>ראשית קצירכם@ee<ENG> means that you should may only bring the @ITomer@it only from the first of the harvest and not from the end or middle of the harvest. @d1Such was its name.@p3 I.e., the measure that contains a tenth of an @ITephoh@it is called an @ITomer.<QC>
@it @p1[11]@p2<TIE>Horizontally away from him and toward him.@p3 You might ask: How does Rashi know that @hh<HEB>תנופה@ee<ENG> includes “vertically upwards and downwards” as well? The answer is: This is derived from a @ITgezeroh shovoh@it of “waved,” “waved.” It says in @ITparshas@it Tetzaveh (Shemos 29:27), “Which were [the] waved (@hh<HEB>הונף@ee<ENG>) and uplifted (@hh<HEB>הורם@ee<ENG>).,” and over tThere [the verse refers to]he movinges [it] horizontally away from him and toward him, and vertically upwards and downwards. Because The word @hh<HEB>הונף@ee<ENG> means to move something away from him and toward himforwards and backwards, similar to the expression “waving (@hh<HEB>הנפה@ee<ENG>) with cloths,” when people chase away flies by moving a cloth to and from themselves. And @hh<HEB>הורם@ee<ENG> means to move something vertically upwards and downwards, because @hh<HEB>הורם@ee<ENG> is an expression of @hh<HEB>הרמה@ee<ENG> (lifting), and if one you lifts something one you haves to lower it. Here too it is the same. @d1To prevent harmful dews.@p3 I.e., so that the dew should serve as a blessing and not as a curse. @d1The Shabbos of Creation.@p3 Every Shabbos is called the Shabbos of Creation because that is when the Holy One “rested” at from the work of Creation. @d1You [cannot] know which [Shabbos] is meant.@p3 Even though this proof is disproved and they cite other proofs there, nonetheless, Rashi cites this proof as it is a response to the words of the Tzedukim and Baitusim, [see explanation of @ITRe’m@it]. Therefore For this [reason] he cites it. @p1[12]@p2<TIE>An obligation in connection with the @BIomer.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Why in @ITparshas@it Pinchas (Bamidbar 28,) which lists [all] the additional offerings [of Pesach], as Rashi explains (in verse 8), is there no mention of this sheep? He answers: This sheep is not brought as an additional offering but comes as an obligation in connection related towith the @ITomer.@it @p1[13]@p2<TIE>The meal-offering [which accompanies] its wineoffering.@p3 I.e., [this offering is] not the meal offering [which is brought] by itself that is mentioned in @ITparshas@it Vayikra. Because iIt is written afterwards “Its wine-offering is one fourth of a @IThin@it,” and since the wine is [comes as] a wine-offering, the meal offering too is also certainly the mealoffering [which accompanies] a wine offering. Even though it is two tenths and the mealoffering of a sheep [that accompanies a wineoffering] is [generally] one [tenth], even so, it is [nevertheless] the meal-offering [which accompanies] a wine-offering, except that [here] it is double [the normal amount].<QC>
@p1[16]@p2<TIE>As its Targum: “the seventh week.”@bo Rashi is answering the question: If it means [the passing of seven] actual Shabbosos, then the seven @hh<HEB>שבתות@ee<ENG> would be not fifty days, but only fortytwo days. @d1On the fiftieth day.@p3 I.e., since we only count forty-nine days, how can the verse write fifty days? He answers that fifty does not refer to “you shall count,” but to the offering, that on the fiftieth day you shall bring it, and the word (@hh<HEB>יום@ee<ENG>) is missing a @hh<HEB>בי"ת@ee<ENG>. It is as if it said, “On the fiftieth day you shall bring it [the sacrifice].” @d1Barley.@p3 I.e., that [offering] is the first of the barley, and the @ITomer@it is the first of the wheat. @p1[17]@p2<TIE>For the Most High.@p3 Explanation: The word @hh<HEB>תנופה@ee<ENG> here does not have the same meaning as @hh<HEB>תנופה@ee<ENG> [of verse 10] where Rashi said it means [waving], “he moves [it] horizontally away from him and toward him.” Because over there, @hh<HEB>תנופה@ee<ENG> occurs after the bringing [of the offering and is part of the sacrificial ceremony]. But here, @hh<HEB>תנופה@ee<ENG> occurs before the bringing [of the offering, and simply means to separate it for Hashem]. This is implied by the [order of the] verse saying that you should bring of the bread of @hh<HEB>תנופה@ee<ENG>, i.e., first @hh<HEB>תנופה@ee<ENG> and then bringing. Perforce, @hh<HEB>תנופה@ee<ENG> here means raising and separating, that it is “raised for the most High.” @d1May not be brought.@p3 Not that this [offering] is [merely of] the first harvested [wheat], but rather, that the offering itself is a first-fruit-offering, first of all the meal-offerings. Because if not so, why does the verse say “first-fruit-offering,” once it is already written, “You shall bring a new meal-offering to Hashem,” i.e., you shall bring the offering from the new [harvest]. Therefore [we say that] the Torah wrote @hh<HEB>בכורים@ee<ENG>, similar to the word @hh<HEB>בכור@ee<ENG> (firstborn), to indicate that it is the first of all the meal-offerings. I.e., even the jealousy offering [of the @ITsotah@it] which is of barley, is only brought after this meal-offering, even though the jealousy offering is not of wheat. @p1[18]@p2<TIE>An obligation.@p3 Since the verse obviously cannot be understooand according to its plain meaning [that the animals are] actually on top [of the bread]. Rather, it means because of the obligatory [offering] of the day, [implying] that if one did not bring the bread, he does not bring the sheep, etc. Rashi says [that it means] “for the sake,” because we find that @hh<HEB>על@ee<ENG> sometimes serves in place of a @ITlamed,@it which serves in place of “for the sake.” @ITRe’m@it explains the meaning of Rashi at length, writing that if one did not bring the bread, he does not bring the sheep, etc., proving this from the @ITToras Kohanim.@it [However] he forgot what is mentioned in Menachos (45a) in the Mishnah, and what is explained further in the Gemara. And so it says there in the words of R. Akiva. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1[19]@p2<TIE>These are [a group] unto themselves.@p3 Explanation: even though the number of sheep and the he-goat of this @ITparshah@it are the same as those of @ITparshas@it Pinchas, however the number of oxen bullocks and rams of this @ITparshah@it are not the same as the bullocks and rams in @ITparshas@it Pinchas. Because here it is written “one young bullock and two rams,” whereas in @ITparshas@it Pinchas (Bamidbar 27:28) it is written, “two young bulls [and] one ram.” @p1[20]@p2<TIE>[While] alive.@p3 We derive this from the @ITgezeroh shovoh@it “them,” “them.” It is written here, “The @ITkohein@it shall @ITwave@it them,” and it is written elsewhere, in @ITparshas@it Metzora (14:12), “And @ITwave@it them [the lamb and @ITlog@it of oil] as a wave-offering before Hashem.” Just as there [it is when they are] alive, for it is written afterwards (verse 13), “He shall slaughter the lamb,” so here too while they are alive. @ITRe’m,@it however, explains: Because [We derive that the animal is waved while still alive] since it says regarding the peace-offering of an individual (above 7:34), “Because the breast waveoffering and the thigh [that is] the uplifted portion I have taken from Bnei Yisroel, from their peace-offerings (@hh<HEB>זבחי שלמיהם@ee<ENG>),” which implies the plural form. It should have said this in the singular form because it is talking of the peace-offering of an individual. This [plural expression] teaches that public peace-offerings too require waving. If so, why does the verse here need to write “The @ITkohein@it shall wave them [the sheep peace-offerings] along with the bread of the first-fruit-offering as a wave-offering before Hashem?” It must be to teach the waving of the public peace offerings is [also] while they are still alive. This is [derived] in @ITPerek Kol Hamenachos@it (Menachos 62a). @d1Holy things of a greater degree.@p3 Because if not, why write holy at all? Can it be that [the sanctity of] peace-offerings of the public be is less holy than peace-offerings of the individual which are holy? Thus, our verse must be saying that they are holy things of a greater degree. @p1[22]@p2<TIE>Leave [it] before them.@p3 @ITNachalas Yaakov@it asks: Why did Rashi not explain this above in @ITparshas@it Kedoshim (Vayikra 19:10) where it is also written [regarding left over grapes], “You shall leave them for the poor and the proselyte?” Also, how can Rashi [here] expound two lessons from one word? I think that one question answers the other. Since it is already written “you shall leave” in @ITparshas@it Kedoshim to teach “Leave [it] before them, etc.,” if so, “you shall leave” over here is apparently superfluous and comes for us to expound another lesson, that [besides] “Leave [it] before them and they will gather [it],” also, “You must not help any one of them [in preference to anyone else].” Rashi wanted to write both these lessons at one time and therefore he waited until here. @p1[24]@p2<TIE>To remember for your sake the binding of Yitzchok.@p3 Explanation. Rashi is answering the question: Why does it not say “It shall be a day of sounding the ram’s horn,” (as in @ITparshas@it Pinchas (Bamidbar 29:1)?. Regarding this he explains: “A mention of Biblical verses, etc.” He is also answering the question: Why do we mention Biblical verses that relate to the @ITshofor.@it Although iIt is understandable that we say recite the Biblical verses relating to kingship since the Holy One Blessed Is He judges the whole world on Rosh Hash anah like a king, but why do we say the Biblical verses which relate to the @ITshofor@it? Rashi answers, “To remember for your sake<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @ITGur Aryeh@it asks: The [extra] blessings of [the Additional prayer of] Rosh Hashanah are only a Rabbinic decree and as can be proven from Rosh Hashanah (34b) [where it says that] we go to a place where they are blowing [the @ITshofor@it] and not to a place where they are reciting [these] blessings, since they [the prayer services] are [only] by from a Rabbinic decree. It seems that the @ITberaisa@it is not explaining that the words of the verse’s words, “a remembrance of the sounding,” actually mean that one must say Biblical verses relating that relate to Remembrances and the @ITshofor,@it because [the mitzvah to recite] these [verses] are is certainly a Rabbinic decree. Rather, Rashi means as follows: Because Scripture writes “a remembrance of the sounding,” and not “a day of sounding,” it means that Israel will be remembered through the sounding. Therefore, it is written “remembrance.” And because of this, the Sages instituted these blessings as it says there (Rosh Hashanah 16a), “Say remembrances so that your remembrances should rise before Me for the good.”<QC>
@p1[31]@p2<TIE>Work at night is prohibited, just as working during the day [is prohibited].@p3 You might ask: Why is this necessary? Why would one exclude the night? The answer is: One may have thought, since it is written “on this very day,” it implies only the actual day as in the verses (Bereishis 7:13) “On that very day Noach came,” “On that very day Avraham [and his son Yishmael] were circumcised” (ibid 17:26). These, which means specifically during the actual daytime, so “Any person who does any work on this very day, etc.,” means specifically during the actual daytime. Therefore one needs “any work, etc.” (@ITRe’m@it) Alternatively, the Gemara (Yuma 81a) says that “on this very day” excludes time added to Yom Kippur., Ii.e., someone who does work during the time added from weekday to sacred at the beginning and the end [of Yom Kippur], one is not liable for @ITkoreis@it. Thus, one may have thought that night too is excluded from [the prohibition of doing] work, and one needs an inclusory verse is necessary.<QC>
@p1[35]@p2<TIE>Fine clothing.@p3 Why does Rashi explain the phrase “a holy assembly” out of order? He should have explained it [where it first appears in verse 27] before explaining “I will cause that person to perish,” and before “You shall not do any work?” The answer is: He could not explain “sanctify it with fine clothing, etc.,” [earlier], because perhaps when it wrote “a holy assembly,” this was to make the night forbidden like the day regarding work and @ITkoreis.@it But now that it is written “You shall not do any work” which is apparently superfluous to teach and warn that work is forbidden by at night as well as by during the day, [therefore] “a holy assembly” must be teaching that we “sanctify it with fine clothing.” This statement [of Rashi] too seems out of place and it belongs earlier, before “I will cause that person to perish,” because [here] he is referring to Yom Kippur of which the verse writes “a holy assembly” [as the Torah also writes regarding other festivals], and [yet] it is different than other assemblies. Therefore, Rashi did not explain anything [in his commentary on the other verses] where it states “a holy assembly” preceding this [when referring to] other festivals. (@ITDivrei Dovid@it)<QC>
@p1[37]@p2<TIE>With the burnt-offering.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Many [kinds] of meal offerings are written in @ITparshas@it Vayikra, so why does the verse not specify which one it is? @ITRe’m@it explains that if the meal-offering was by itself, it should have said “a burnt-offering and a sacrifice and wine-offerings and a meal-offering.” @d1In Chumash Hapekudim.@p3 In @ITparshas@it Pinchas, where all the @ITmusofim@it are specified, some days with many @ITmusofim@it and some days with few @ITmusofim.@it  @p1[40]@p2<TIE>Which remain on its tree.@p3 You might ask: [perhaps the verse refers to] the long pepper which remains on its tree from year to year and the taste of its wood and its fruit are also the same? The answer is: Even so, one cannot fulfill one’s obligation with it since if one takes [only] one it would not be the requisite size and its taking would be insignificant. And if one took two or three, the verse writes “You shall take for yourselves .<TIE>.<TIE>. a @ITfruit@it,” which implies one fruit and not two. @d1One [palm branch].@p3 You might ask: If so, the verse should have written @hh<HEB>כף@ee<ENG>? The @ITNachalas Yaakov@it answers: @hh<HEB>כפת@ee<ENG> implies one branch with many leaves, whereas @hh<HEB>כף@ee<ENG> implies one leaf only. @p1[42]@p2<TIE>This is the native-born.@p3 I.e., an Israelite, because Scripture writes @hh<HEB>האזרח@ee<ENG> (lit. the citizen) with the definitive article of @hh<HEB>ה"א@ee<ENG>, this implies the highest form of citizen, namely a [native born] Israelite. But if so why does the verse write “Israelite”? Perforce it is to include [the fact that] converts [are considered] like Israelites.<QC>
@p1[3]@p2<TIE>The westernmost lamp.@p3 @ITGur Aryeh@it writes: @ITRe’m@it asks: how does one reconcile the Rabbis’ exposition with the “Curtain of Testimony”? The curtain does not serve as a curtain for the westernmost lamp, which [according to the Rabbis] is called a testimony! The answer is as follows: The curtain is called the “Curtain of Testimony” since it was next to the ark that holds the Tablets of Testimony which are a testimony between the Holy One and Yisroel. However, the Rabbis are explaining why the Torah specifically writes the “Curtain of Testimony” here [where the Torah speaks of the menorah]. They explain that only through the westernmost lamp from which the @ITkohein@it begins and where he ends, is it evident that the curtain is a “Curtain of Testimony.” The “Tablets of Testimony” alone are no proof to this testimony, since they do not demonstrate that the Divine Presence still dwells in the midst of Yisroel, as perhaps it no longer dwells in Yisroel. Thus, we need the westernmost lamp to demonstrate that the curtain is a “Curtain of Testimony” and that the Tablets are a testimony between the Holy One and Yisroel that the Divine Presence still dwells in the midst of Yisroel. [Alternatively], even if you say that the word “testimony” here refers to the westernmost lamp there is no difficulty, because the Torah says that the menorah should be next to the curtain as it says, “outside of the Curtain of Testimony,” from which @ITToras Kohanim@it derives that the menorah must be closer to the curtain than it is to the entrance. Therefore, since the menorah is at the curtain and close to the curtain, it is appropriate to call the curtain the “Curtain of Testimony” because they are together. @d1And with it he would end.@p3 I.e., when he began lighting the lamps in the evening, he would first light the westernmost lamp. And when he came to set up the lamps in the morning he would set them all up and the westernmost lamp would still be burning; he would take out the burning wicks out and set [them] up. However, this lamp he only set up in the evening and he would put into it the same amount of oil as the other lamps. So explains Rashi in @ITPerek Bameh Madlikin@it (Shabbos 22b).<QC>
@p1[6]@p2<TIE>Six loaves.@p3 The is an abbreviated verse and Rashi has to add the word “loaves” after the word “six,” in order to tell us what these six are. Rashi adds the word “one” to tell us that the six other loaves were on a second stack. @d1On the “purity.”@bo The meaning of “purity” is the top. In Arabic the top is called @ITtahor,@it with a weak @hh<HEB>טי"ת@ee<ENG> that is called @ITdat@it in that language. @ITRe’m.@it<QC>
@d1Above the table.@p3 I.e., there were supports above the table upon which the loaves rested; they [i.e. the tubes that rested on the supports] separated between all the loaves as is explained in @ITparshas@it Terumah, so that the upper loaves would not weigh down on the lower ones and break them. However, there was no [supporting] tube on the table, because the loaf at the bottom rested [directly] on the table @p1[7]@p2<TIE>On each one of the two stacks.@p3 Explanation: This is derived from a @ITgezeroh shovoh.@it It is written “stack” here, and it is written “stack” regarding the showbread. Just as [the word] “stack” stated by the showbread refers to two, so here also, [meaning] he put down two bowls of frankincense, i.e., he put frankincense next to each stack. The bowls were not placed on the bread but next to each stack, so that the bread should not break from the bowls’ weight. When the verse says “on (@hh<HEB>על@ee<ENG>) [each] stack” it means next to and close to the stack, similar to, “And spread the @ITparoches@it (partition) over (@hh<HEB>על@ee<ENG>) the ark.”<QC>
@p1[10]@p2<TIE>He went out of his [everlasting] world.@p3 Because we derive lessons from juxtapositions. [Since] it is written above, “an everlasting statute” [and then it says], “[He] went out,” it hints that he went out of his [everlasting] world. @d1“Every @BIShabbos @BOhe shall arrange them.”@bo @ITRe’m@it writes: This indicates that the incident of the blasphemer occurred in the second year, because there was no showbread until after the @ITMishkon @itwas erected. Similarly, the arrangement of the tribes under flags [mentioned by Rashi in verse 10] only happened in the second year as it is written in @ITparshas@it Bamidbar@ee. But this is contradicted by @ITRashi@it who writes, “’They placed him [in the guardhouse],’ (by himself), and they did not place the wood-gatherer with him, etc.” But the wood-gatherer incident occurred in the first year as Rashi (Bamidbar 15:32) explains [on the verse], “(Bnei Yisroel were in the desert) and they found a man gathering wood.” “Scripture speaks disparagingly of the Israelites. They kept only the first Shabbos, and then this person came and desecrated the second, etc.” Thus, the incident of the blasphemer was also in the first year. @ITRe’m@it answers: Even though there was no showbread until the second year, nonetheless, perhaps they had been commanded about it in the first year, and at the time of the command, that wicked person heard and immediately mocked. See there. @d1Whom Moshe killed.@p3 Because you might ask: Regarding @ITRashi’s@it above explanation that, “He entered Moshe’s court and went out guilty, [whereupon] he stood up and blasphemed,” how did this [blaspheming] result from that [his leaving guilty]. Therefore [@ITRashi@it explains that] it means as follows: When they told him that it is written “[according to] the signs of their fathers’ house,” he said to them, “Who was my father?” They said to him, “He was an Egyptian.” He said to them, “Which Egyptian?” They said to him, “The Egyptian that Moshe killed with the explicit Name.” He immediately stood up and blasphemed [the Name that killed his father]. @d1He was converted.@p3 You might ask: In @ITparshas@it Shemos @ITRashi@it explains on the verse, “And he saw that no man was there,” that no good man was destined to descend from him. The answer is: This is why @ITRashi@it writes “Destined to descend from him,” as this one was already born at that time. However, no good person would come from him afterwards. Regarding @ITRashi’s@it statement that he was converted, [you might ask that] when a non-Jew has relations with a Jewess the offspring is a kosher [Jew], so why did he have to convert? The @ITRamban@it answers that it was not that he required conversion, but that like all of Bnei Yisroel he underwent the circumcision, immersion, and sprinkling of blood at the time the Torah was given. He chose not to follow his father’s ways, but went after his mother and attached himself to the Israelites. @ITTosfos@it answer that before the giving of the Torah, the status of offspring was determined by one’s father. When he was born they did not circumcise [or convert] him because he was an Egyptian, and when he grew up, he converted voluntarily. @d1Who protested.@p3 I.e., he would not allow him to pitch his tent there. @p1[11]@p2<TIE>She alone.@p3 @ITRe’m@it asks: In @ITParshas@it Shemos (2:11), @ITRashi@it explains, “She thought that he was her husband.” If so, she erred and [did] not [sin] voluntarily, so why does he call her wayward? It seems to me that she was not modest before men as @ITRashi@it explains, “She would chatter.<TIE>.<TIE>., inquiring [about] everyone’s wellbeing.” Therefore, she stumbled into waywardness and suffered this mishap, just as we find with Dinah. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1[12]@p2<TIE>By himself.@p3. [Afterwards@IT Rashi@it] explains [that he was imprisoned by himself] because the woodgatherer was more wicked, since everyone knew that he was liable for the death penalty, whereas the blasphemer was less wicked, for they did not know whether or not he was liable for the death penalty. Therefore they were not imprisoned together. As the Gemara says that there were two cemeteries, one for those whom [Beis Din] stoned, and one for those whom they burnt [because stoning is punishment for a more serious sin]. Similarly, we do not imprison someone who is [considered] more wicked together with someone who is [considered] less wicked. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @d1That one who gathered wood [on Shabbos] was [condemned] to death.@p3 This is a reason for the above, why he [Moshe] did not put them together. He [Rashi] explains that this was because they knew that this one was liable to death, but did not know whether the blasphemer was liable to death. Perhaps he was not liable to death and would suffer by thinking, that because they are sitting together [he too, must be liable to death]. @d1The execution itself.@p3 You might ask: Since they knew that one who desecrates Shabbos is liable to death, why did they not punish him with strangling, since every unspecified death penalty in the Torah is by strangling? The answer is: They thought that one who desecrates Shabbos is like an idolater and an atheist; since he does not believe that the Holy One rested at Creation he does not believe that the Holy One created the world, and it is as if he believes in idolatry. And perhaps, just as idolatry is punished by stoning, so too one who desecrates Shabbos is punished by stoning, or perhaps [he is punished by] strangling. Therefore, they were in doubt. Many ask, why was there any doubt? If someone who curses a father or mother is liable to death, how much more so regarding the Divine Presence? You cannot answer that we do not derive punishment from a @ITkal vachomer,@it because if so, it would be obvious that he was not liable for death since [the prohibition against blasphemy] was not explicitly [stated until now]. It seems that they were in doubt here because he had not been warned properly, and the Gemara rules in Sanhedrin that a person is not liable for any sin unless he was warned that he will be liable to death and also the type death he is liable for. This however, was a temporary injunction [valid only] for that particular time [to kill him without prior warning]. (@ITDivrei Dovid@it)<QC>
@p1[14]@p2<TIE>For you caused [it] to yourself.@p3 Some explain [that the witnesses were saying], “We will not be punished [for testifying against you],” even though the witnesses have to testify [the actual blasphemy] they heard from the blasphemer. However, this is not implied in Rashi. @d1In the presence of the entire congregation.@p3 You might ask: How does Rashi know this? Perhaps the verse implies its plain meaning as taught in the Mishnah of @ITPerek Nigmar Hadin@it (Sanhedrin 45a), “He is stoned by all Yisroel,” and the Mishnah there is speaking of all cases when people are liable to death? The answer is: There it is different because the Mishnah says, “One of the witnesses pushes him [so that he falls onto] his back [lit. loins] .<TIE>.<TIE>. If he died through this, the obligation has been fulfilled. And if not, he is stoned by all Yisroel as it says, “The hand of the witnesses shall be upon him first to kill him, and the hand of the entire nation in the end” (Devarim 17:7). This [indicates that] we require the hand of the witnesses be first. But here it is written, “The entire congregation shall surely stone him,” implying that they should all stone him immediately, and thus the verses apparently contradict each other. Therefore, Rashi answers that although the witnesses’ hands are is certainly first, this should be [done] in the presence of the entire congregation so that it is as if the entire congregation stoned him, because a man’s agent is like the man himself. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1[20]@p2<TIE>We appraise [his worth] as a slave.@p3 Explanation: What he was worth without the maiming and what he is worth with it, and he pays the depreciation.<QC>
@p1[21]@p2<TIE>Who causes a wound to it.@p3 Because if not so, why should he pay for it [for merely smiting it]? What deficiency did he make in it that he should pay? @d1His father or his mother.@p3 Explanation: Because it is not written “soul,” it implies a blow that did not cause death. However, if the verse is speaking of someone else [i.e., other than his father or mother], is written (Shemos 21:12), “If one strikes a man and he [the victim] @ITdies@it (he shall be put to death),” not only for a mere blow. Perforce, it is speaking of one who strikes his father or his mother.<QC>
@p1[1]@p2<TIE>Their general rules and specifications.@p3 You might ask: How does Rashi know that all of them [including] their general rules and specifications were said at Sinai? Obviously, because the superfluous words “on Mount Sinai” indicate that the general rules and specifications were said at Mount Sinai. But perhaps this only comes to teach [the laws] of about the Sabbatical year itself, and not about other @ITmitzvos@it? Also, regarding [the claim that these words are superfluous] itself you can object, from where [does Rashi know this]? Perhaps [the verse writes] “on Mount Sinai” so that you do not say that “(And Hashem spoke to him from) the Tent of Meeting” written at the beginning of @ITparshas@it Vayikra refers to all the @ITparshiyos@it after @ITparshas@it Vayikra, and therefore it writes “on Mount Sinai” here? The answer is: This is why Rashi writes “And it seems to me, etc.” He means as follows: Since we do not find that [the laws of] @ITshemittoh@it of the land whose general rules principles were taught at Sinai were repeated at the Plains of Moab in @ITSefer Devorim@it., Tthis could make lead one to mistakenly say that all the @ITmitzvos@it were repeated taught at the Plains of Moav because of their details and specifications, and are [thus] not from Sinai. Even though it is written later at the end of Vayikra (27:34), “These are the commandments which Hashem commanded Moshe for Bnei Yisroel on Mount Sinai,” which implies that @ITall@it the @ITmitzvos@it are from Sinai, this may apply only to the general rules of @ITmitzvos@it but not to their details. However, since the Sabbatical year is not repeated there except in the hint of “Suspend (every creditor’s hand from his loan to his neighbor)” (Devorim 15:2), if so, its general rules @ITand@it details must all have been said at Sinai. If so, why does the verse here [superfluously] say “Mount Sinai”? It must be to teach us that every utterance which was prophetically said to Moshe, that @ITall@it of them were from Sinaiùtheir general rules @ITand@it their specifications. And [the Sabbatical year] is an example that applies to the entire Torah.
@p1[2] The Shabbos of Ccreation.@p3 You might ask: What has this [Shabbos] to do with that [the Sabbatical year]? The answer is: A person sometimes stops plowing his land for its benefit, so that the land should be fertile. Therefore, Rashi explains, “As it was said regarding the Shabbos of creation.” I.e., it says there (Shemos 20:10), “But the seventh day is Shabbos to Hashem, your God,” since the Holy One rested on the seventh day. Here too, we are commanded to keep the Sabbatical year in the seventh year in order to remind us that the Holy One rested on the seventh day. And the verse is commanding to not plow the land for the sake of Hashem, and his intent should not be for his own benefit.
@p1[4]@p2<TIE>For the fields.@p3 Because if not [for this limitation], even making a hole in the earth [for non-agricultural purposes] would be forbidden. Therefore, Rashi explains: “For the fields and vineyards.” His proof for this is that it is written, “Y@eeou shall not plant your field and you shall not prune your vineyard,” indicating that only fields and vineyards are forbidden, whereas making a hole is permitted. You might ask: Why does Rashi not explain this above where it says “The land shall be at rest”? The answer is: [If he said it there] you might object, how does he know that? Perhaps even digging the earth is forbidden? Here, however, it is explicitly written a “field” and a “vineyard.”
@d1That they cut off its branches.@p3 You might ask: Why does Rashi not explain this above where it states “Y@eeou shall prune your vineyard”? The answer is: Above you might have thought that @hh<HEB>תזמור@ee<ENG> is an expression of planting, [meaning] that one should not plant branches that grow will beinto a vineyard. But now that it is written@hh<HEB> וכרמך לא תזמור@ee<ENG> (your vineyard you shall not prune), by writing “vineyard” first indicates that the vineyard has already been planted, and if so, what is the meaning of @hh<HEB>לא תזמור@ee<ENG>? Thus, it must be an expression of pruning.
@d1And its Targum is: “you shall not cut off.”@bo You might ask: Why does Rashi not [simply] explain, “Like its Targum?” The answer is: [He wanted to add] that it is also an expression found in Scripture, “as thorns cut off.” We find the same in @ITparshas@it Vayeitzei (Bereishis 30:32) [regarding the word] @hh<HEB>חום@ee<ENG> (dark) where Rashi explains @hh<HEB>שחום@ee<ENG> (dark brown), which is [actually] like its Targum. [If so], why does Rashi not [simply] explain “Like its Targum”? Because [he wants to explain that] it is also an expression found in the Mishnah, “[It was sold as] dark brown (@hh<HEB>שחמתית@ee<ENG>) etc.”
@p1[5]@p2<TIE>To retain it with the rest of the harvest.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Why does it say @hh<HEB>קצירך@ee<ENG> (your harvest)? It should have just said “Crops that grew on their own you shall not reap.” He answers, “To retain it<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Alternatively, Rashi is answering [the question of] how can Scripture write “you shall not reap,” when it is written [later], “The [produce] .<TIE>.<TIE>. shall be for yourselves, for food,” indicating that one may eat it, and it is unreasonable [to suggest] that one eats it from the field like an animal without reaping it. Regarding this he explains, “To retain it<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”
@d1But from [that which is] ownerless.@p3 @ITRe’m@it explains that the first command [of this verse] teaches us that one may not even reap even crops that grew on their own unless they are ownerless, and the same applies to grapes that grew without pruning or digging. The second command teaches that even if the owner kept people away from the grapes, or even if he transgressed by plowing and sowing and only then he made them ownerless, the grapes may be eaten and the owner may gather them like any poor person. The same applies to crops. If the owner kept people away from them, or even if he transgressed by plowing and sowing and only then he made them ownerless, the grapes may be eaten, and the owner too may reap them like any poor reaper.
@p1[6]@p2<TIE>All shall be equal in it.@p3 You might ask: Rashi already explained above, “’You shall not reap,’ [in order] to retain it with the rest of the harvest, but it should be ownerlessùfree to all,” which implies that one may benefit from it or eat it. The answer is: Above too, Rashi proved this from here. Because if not for this verse, “[It] shall be for yourselves, for food,” I would say that “you shall not reap” forbids even eating and benefit.
@d1From that which has been “rested.” @bo@hh<HEB>שבות@ee<ENG> is an expression of permission. I.e., you may eat whatever everyone has permission to take from, i.e., [whatever is] ownerless.
@d1From that which is kept.@p3 Explanation: From the fruits of the Sabbatical year that someone kept for himself, by not making them ownerless. [Rashi understands that @hh<HEB>שבת@ee<ENG> means @hh<HEB>שבות@ee<ENG>] because the verse writes “The land’s @ITShabbos@it[-year] (shall be for yourselves)@ee,” instead of writing, “@ITThe produce of@it the land’s @ITShabbos@it[-year] shall be for yourselves.” Thus [he understands that] @hh<HEB>שבת @ee<ENG> means @hh<HEB>שבות@ee<ENG>. Even though above, Rashi commented on the verse “You shall not gather,” that “Those you may not gather, but from [that which is] ownerless, [you may gather],” there he was only talking about grapes, whereas here the verse includes all produce from the land. Alternatively, that [law of the earlier verse] is derived from here, because, as I explained above, if not for this verse, you would think that one may not gather at all.
@d1By the wealthy.@p3 And you might think that when the verse includes the owner by writing, “The [produce] of the land’s @ITShabbos@it[-year] shall be for yourselves, for food,” that is only if he too is poor since it is written (Shemos 23:11), “And let the needy among your people eat it.” Therefore Scripture writes, “For you, and for your servant,” to teach that even if he is wealthy he may eat it. You might ask: Why does it write here “(you), your servant and your maidservant?” It should only write “you,” since poor people are already mentioned in the verse “And let the needy among your people eat it”? The answer is: Here it is speaking of before [the time of] @ITbi’ur,@it when there is still produce in the field, [in which case rich and poor are equal]. But there it is talking about after [the time of] @ITbi’ur,@it when the householder has to put his [produce that he had taken indoors back] in the field. Therefore it is written “And let the needy among your people eat it,” because [only] they eat without having to put [anything] in the field. (@ITGur Aryeh@it) You might ask: If so, why do I need [the words] “And let the needy among your people eat it”? If a wealthy person may eat, how much more a poor person! The answer is: “The needy among your people” have precedence over a wealthy person. Therefore, it is written “And let the needy among your people eat it.”
@d1Even the non-Jews.@p3 @ITNachalas Yaakov@it explains: You cannot say the verse is talking about a Jew and that @hh<HEB>שכיר@ee<ENG> (hired hand) means [a Jew] acquired for [six] years, and (resident sojourner) means [a Jew] acquired forever [i.e., until the @ITYovel@it], like every [other use of the words] @hh<HEB>שכיר@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>תושב@ee<ENG> in Scripture, because the verse already said “your slave and your female slave,” and these are Jews. The verse is telling us that even though the year is called “holy,” its fruit is permitted to non-Jews. @ITGur Aryeh@it asks: Why does the verse need to write [both] “for your hired hand” [and also “for your resident sojourner”]? The answer is: If it only wrote “for your hired hand,” I might think that only he [eats Sabbatical year produce] because he is a Jew’s worker and it is normal to give him food, whereas, since a Jew is not responsible to provide food for “your resident sojourner,” I might think he may not [eat food of the Sabbatical year]. So it tells us [otherwise]. And if it [only] wrote “for your sojourner,” I might think [only] a sojourner who accepted upon himself not to serve idols [may eat food of the Sabbatical year], but not a regular non-Jew, so it tells us [otherwise].
@p1[7]@p2<TIE>Since you are obligated to feed it.@p3 @ITNachalas Yaakov@it explains as follows: Because the verse is permitting the [Sabbatical year’s] fruits even to non-Jews, domesticated animals and beasts, even though the fruits are holy, it would be more logical to permit them [only] to a domesticated animal which is a mitzvah to feed since it belongs to you and you are obligated to feed it, unlike the beast [which you are not obliged to feed]. [Therefore Rashi is answering the question]: If so, why does the verse need to say “for your domesticated animals”? This answers the question of @ITRe’em,@it see there.
@d1Put at an end (to that stored) for your domesticated animal [removing it] from the house. @bo@eeI.e., you must remove whatever fruit you gathered for your domesticated animals from the house when they those [fruits] are gone no longer [growing] infrom the field [and no longer available] for wild beasts. And one has to make ownerless all the Sabbatical fruit that he had gathered into the house.
@p1[8]@p2<TIE>Seven sabbatical years.@p3 Explanation: The sabbatical year is called Shabbos as it says (later 26:34), “The land will then be appeased for its Shabbosos.” So translates Onkelos, “Seven sabbatical years.” The proof [that “Shabbos” means “sabbatical year” and not “a period of seven years”], is because Scripture writes [afterwards], “seven years, seven times@ee,” which indicates that [Shabbos] refers to [sabbatical] years and not to a period of seven years. [Otherwise, why should the verse repeat the same thing twice?] [Translating @hh<HEB>שבתת@ee<ENG> as “a period of seven years] would have been] similar to “Seven complete weeks (@hh<HEB>שבתות@ee<ENG>) they shall be” (earlier 23:15), which Onkelos translates as “seven complete weeks.” [See @ITRe’m@it]
@d1That even if, etc., declare the jJubilee.@p3 Explanation: Expound the verse as follows: “And it shall be for you, the days (period) of the seven sabbatical years forty-nine years,” then [even if you did not declare the sabbatical years], “you shall make a proclamation with the @ITshofar@it” and declare the Jubilee.
@d1Add up to the number forty-nine.@p3 You might ask: Does the verse need to tell us the number? The @ITRe’m@it answers: This is the way of Scripture in many places. But, it seems to me [that Rashi says this] since the year of @ITyovel@it counts for here and for there. I.e., during this year of @ITyovel,@it one [already] begins to count [towards] the [next] sabbatical year [that is to arrive] after the @ITyovel@it (Rosh Hashana 9a). If so, I might say that every the sabbatical year too also counts for here and for there, and the sum of the years would only be forty-three. Therefore, Rashi explains, forty-nine. Another answer is that Scripture writes “seven sabbatical years@ee” and then writes “You shall make a proclamation with the @ITshofar@it on the tenth day of the seventh month, on Yom Kippur.” If so, I might have said that the forty-nine years end on Yom Kippur, and there will be ten days extra. Therefore, Rashi explains “forty-nine.”
@p1[9]@p2<TIE>An expression of “proclaiming.”@bo Not [an expression of] moving something with one’s hand (Rosh Hashanah 34a).
@d1Since it is said, “onOn Yom Kippur@bo@ee.” @ITGur Aryeh@it asks: Why does Rashi not ask this question according to the order of the verse as follows: Since it states, “On the tenth day of the (seventh) month,” do I not know that it is on Yom Kippur?. If so, why does it say, “on Yom Kippur”? The answer is: Rashi thinks it is no coincidence that the verse makes the Jubilee contingent on Yom Kippur. There is certainly a reason for this, and therefore the verse has to write, “On Yom Kippur shall this @ITshofar@it-proclamation be made,” making the mitzvah of the Jubilee contingent on Yom Kippur.@ee The reason is, as understanding people know, that the @ITyovel@it and Yom Kippur share common features, because during the @ITyovel@it everything reverts to its original state [of ownership] as in the beginning, and so too on Yom Kippur everything returns to its original status because Hashem atones gives atonement to people and they return to their original condition.
@p1[10]@p2<TIE>They sanctify it in @BIBeis Din@BO.@p3 But not on the tenth of the month when they proclaim the JjubileeJubilee with the shofar. Because if it was so, why write “the year of the fiftieth year”? We already know that they are sanctifying the fiftieth year [from the previous verse]. You need not ask: This verse implies that that people are freed from the beginning of the year, while above it writes, “You shall make a proclamation with the @ITshofar@it on the tenth day of the seventh month.” Why make a proclamation with the @ITshofar@it on the tenth [day] if the year is already sanctified in every way from the beginning of the year? The Gemara already answered this in the first chapter of Rosh Hashana (8b): “From Rosh Hashanah until Yom Kippur, slaves did not leave for home and did not work for their masters. Rather, they ate and drank and had crowns on their heads. Once Yom Kippur arrived, @ITBeis Din@it blew the @ITshofar@it and slaves would leave for their homes and fields would return to their owners.”
@d1As one [=a free man] who dwells at an inn, etc.@p3 And takes merchandise around the whole country. The @ITAruch@it explains, “’Like a runner with a load.’ Explanation. The carrier of the load [of] a merchant, who runs and takes merchandise everywhere. @hh<HEB>מדייר@ee<ENG> is an expression of running, and @hh<HEB>דיירא@ee<ENG> means a load. [It is actually spelled] @hh<HEB>מדוור@ee<ENG> with two @ITvavs@it.” But Rashi there explains, “As one who dwells at an inn. Someone who is in his own jurisdiction and can dwell in any inn he pleases.” @IT@it 
@d1The fields return.@p3 According to this, the verse is in the wrong order. It should say, “The ancestral land should return to each man,” and not that the owners return to the fields as is implied in “Each man shall return, etc.”
@d1To include one who[se ear has been] pierced.@p3 Explanation: [This refers to] tThe person [whose ear has been] pierced person who reached the Jubilee before six years passed since his piercing, as is taught in the Beraisa of @ITToras Kohanim@it and Kiddushin (15a). You might ask: Since it is already written (verse 10) “proclaim freedom,” and Rashi explained, “To slaves, whether [one whose ear has been] pierced, etc.,” why [also] write, “Each man shall return to his family”? The answer is: When Rashi explained that “proclaim freedom” means, “To slaves, whether [one whose ear has been] pierced, etc.,” he actually derived this from “Each man shall return to his family,” as this is the main verse. Proof for this is that Rashi comments on the verse in @ITVe’eileh Hamishpatim@it (Shemos 21:6), “He then serves his master forever,” that “[This means] until the Jubilee year.” He then asks, “Or perhaps it means @ITforever@it as is its literal meaning? The Torah therefore says: ’And each man will return to his family.’” He does not cite the verse, “And proclaim freedom,” indicating that it (the latter part of the verse) is the main source. Another answer is that if the Torah only wrote “And proclaim freedom,” I might think that he only leaves at the @ITyovel@it if @ITbeis din@it had sold him, but not if he sold himself. Therefore, it says “Each man will return to his family.” Or [I may have thought the inference of each of the two verses may be] the opposite.
@p1[11]@p2<TIE>As it is [stated] in Rosh Hashanah.@p3 Explanation: Wherever it says “holy,” such as pertaining to Shabbos and Yom Tov, we add from secular to the holy, and here pertaining to the Jubilee too it is written (verse 10) “You shall sanctify.” Thus, one may have thought that we add to the Jubilee from the year following the Jubilee. Therefore it says, “@ITIt@it is a Jubilee, the year of the fiftieth year,” only this year and no more, and one does not need to add from the following year.
@d1Just as this is said, etc.@p3 You might ask: Why does Rashi explain, “Just as this is said, etc.,” on the phrase “You shall not gather the [grapes of] its untended vineyard,” more than on the phrase “You shall not plant and you shall not reap”? The answer is: Rashi writes “Just as this is said, etc.,” because regarding the JjubileeJubilee it is written “You shall not gather its untended vineyard [lit. fruits]” without specifying, and one might think that this applies to other fruits but not to grapes. Therefore Rashi explains, “Just as, etc.,” since there by the sabbatical year it says “The grapes of your untended vines (@hh<HEB>את ענבי נזירך@ee<ENG>) you shall not gather,” and here too likewise it writes, “its untended vineyard” (@hh<HEB>את נזיריה@ee<ENG>). Just as it applies to grapes there as it is explicitly written, “The grapes of your untended vines you shall not gather,” so here too it applies to grapes. Therefore Rashi explains, “Just as, etc.,” i.e., the sabbatical year and the Jubilee are the sameidentical in everything [restriction]. (@ITKitzur Mizrachi@it) You might ask: What is Rashi telling us? Does the verse not state explicitly, “You shall count for yourself seven sabbatical years.<TIE>.<TIE>. You shall sanctify the year of the fiftieth year”? The @ITKitzur Mizrachi@it found written [an answer] written: From the verses it is not obvious that they are [both] equally holy, and one may have thought that one has greater sanctity than the other does. But now that he explained, “Just as this is said in regard to the sabbatical year, so it is said in regard to the Jubilee,” we know their sanctity is equal. (@ITR. Noson@it)
@p1[12]@p2<TIE>Its sanctity attaches its worth as Temple property [does].@p3 Explanation: If one redeemed the fruit of the sabbatical year or JjubileeJubilee with money, this money attaches [to itself the] sanctity [of the fruits]. It is like @IThekdesh@it (Temple property) that was redeemed for its monetary worth, where the money is attached and become @IThekdesh.@it 
@d1Perhaps it becomes common food?@bo Like Temple property redeemed for its worth, where the money because attached in its stead and [the Temple property] becomes non-sanctified. [Perhaps] fruit of the sabbatical year is the same? The verse thus teaches, “It shall be,” [i.e., it remains sanctified.]
@d1Just as it was said in regard to the seventh [year].@p3 You might ask: Why does Rashi explain “Just as, etc.” He already explained this above regarding the untended vineyard? The answer is that this is proof to what he explained, “If [the crops] of the field have ended for the beast, you have to remove [crops that have been stored] from the house.” You might have asked, how does Rashi know this? Perhaps even if the crops have ended for the beast, you still do not have to remove [the crops] from the house. And when it is written, “Whatever is in the field, you may eat of its produce,” it means that what you bring from the field you [must] eat on that day, and [you may] not [eat] from what you stored of it in the house. [Rashi’s answer] is: Do you not agree that whatever is stated in regard to the sabbatical year, so too it is stated in regard to the Jubilee? And regarding the sabbatical year it is written (verse 7), “For your domesticated animals and for the [wild] beasts,” and Rashi asked, “If a [wild] beast may eat, certainly a domesticated animal”? And he answered, “[When the produce] is gone from the field for beasts, put at an end (to what you stored) for your domesticated animal [by removing it] from the house.” Thus, the same applies to the Jubilee. This is why Rashi said, “Just as it was said, etc.”
@p1[13]@p2<TIE>It returns to his father in the Jjubilee.@p3 I.e., do not say that since his son will inherit him [anyway], the field should not return to his father in the jubileeJubilee.
@p1[14]@p2<TIE>This refers to cheating in monetary matters.@p3 I explained this in @ITparshas@it Kedoshim (above 19:33). (@ITKitzur Mizrachi@it) [says] in the name of R. Noson: Although our Sages said that the laws regarding to cheating in monetary matters do not apply to [buying or selling] land, however this only pertains to [not] having to return the money when the cheating was by more than one sixth. Nonetheless, he transgresses a negative commandment [by doing so].
@p1[15]@p2<TIE>How many years there are until the jubileeJubilee.@p3 (@ITDivrei Dovid@it) You might ask: According to Rashi’s explanation that the verse “according to the number of years” is explaining the cheating involved in selling land, would we not know this ourselves? Since he is obligated to return it in the jubileeJubilee, the sale [price] obviously depends on the time left until the jubileeJubilee. Perhaps the difference that arises from this [Rashi’s explanation] is when a first buyer sold to a second buyer. You might have thought that he [the first buyer] can say to him, “I am selling it to you forever! Even though you have to return it to the [original] seller, I have nothing to do with that! The obligation is upon you to fulfill the mitzvah.” This would be similar to someone who sells an animal to a slaughterer, where the obligation to give the gifts to a @ITkohein@it rests upon the slaughterer and not upon the seller. Here too regarding the jubileeJubilee [one might have thought it is the same and that] one is permitted to “cheat” him [the second buyer]. So it comes to teach us that even in this case do not cheat, and you are included in the obligation [to ensure that the field returns to its original owner].
@d1And according to the years [remaining] and the crops.@p3 Explanation: This verse, “a@eeccording to the number of years,” is explained afterwards in the next verse, “Based on the abundance of years, etc.” Even though the first verse is speaking of the years that passed @ITsince@it the [last] jubileeJubilee, while the next verse is speaking of the years @ITuntil@it the [next] jubileeJubilee, this is because the one results from the other, since the buyer and seller only look at the years remaining until the jubileeJubilee and calculate according to them. Therefore, Rashi explains both verses according to the years remaining. @ITRe’m@it 
@d1In less than two years.@p3 Because they find it problematical to explain [verse 14 in a way] that the first verse (verse 14) is connected with the second verse (verse 15). [See @ITRe’m@it]
@p1[16]@p2<TIE>Lessen its price.@p3 Because@hh<HEB>תרבה @ee<ENG> or @hh<HEB>תמעיט מקנתו@ee<ENG> implies to increase or decrease the [number of the] field’s sales, which is not the verse’s meaning. Therefore Rashi explains, “’You shall increase its purchase price,’ sell it at a high price,” and “’You shall decrease its purchase price,’ lessen its price.” Rashi says, “’You shall increase its purchase price,’ sell it at a high price (@hh<HEB>תמכרנה ביוקר@ee<ENG>),” instead of saying “increase its price” (@hh<HEB>תרבה בדמיה@ee<ENG>) as he said “lessen its price” (@hh<HEB>תמעיט בדמיה@ee<ENG>), so that you do not think that one should increase and lessen its price more than it is worth. The expression @hh<HEB>תמכרנה ביוקר@ee<ENG>, however, does not imply selling for more than its worth, but rather [implies] that it is worth a lot. @ITRe’m@it
@p1[17]@p2<TIE>Here [the verse] forbids insulting others with words.@bo Rashi specifically says “here,” because since it is written@hh<HEB> עמיתו@ee<ENG>(his fellow), annoying someone with words is applicable. But in verse 14 where it says @hh<HEB>אל תונו איש את אחיו@ee<ENG> (do not cheat, a man his brother), one cannot say it means annoying with words because however he denigrates [his brother], he is denigrating with his own flaw since his brother’s honor is his own honor, and by insulting his brother he himself is insulted. Therefore, over there he explains it as cheating in monetary matters, and here he explains it as insulting with words. And so writes the @ITSheloh.@it (@ITR. Yaakov Taryosh@it)
@p1[18]@p2<TIE>For, by the sin of [neglecting] the sabbatical year Israel is exiled.@p3 And when the beginning of the verse says, “You shall fulfill My statutes and keep My laws and fulfill them,” it is referring to the statutes and laws pertaining to the sabbatical year, because if not what is its relevance to here?
@p1[19]@p2<TIE>Within your stomach.@p3 Because once it is explicitly written “The land will give forth its fruit,” we already know that you will eat one’s your fiull, so why write “You will eat your fill”? Therefore Rashi explains, “Within your stomach<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” You might ask: Why does Rashi turn the verse around and explain “You will live securely on it,” before explaining “You will eat your fill”? Also, why does Rashi cite two phrases of the verse, “The land will give forth<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>., etc. and you will live securely on it,” and then only explain “And you will securely on it”? The answer is: Learning the verse according to its order one could understand that “you will live securely” refers to “you will eat your fuill,” and is answering the question that once [the Torah writes] “the land will give its fruit,” why does it need to write “you will eat your fill”? If it is to tell you that “there will be blessing even within your stomach,” as meaning that you will eat [only] a little and it will bring provide blessing in your stomach, as implied by the verse writing @hh<HEB>לשובע@ee<ENG> (to fullness) and not @hh<HEB>ושבעתם@ee<ENG> (you will be filled), as the satiation will come afterwards by itself, why should the Torah give such a blessing? Is it not better to taste food and enjoy eating one’s food? The verse answers this question by saying “you will live securely.” You will not need to worry about years of famine (@hh<HEB>בצורת@ee<ENG>) that might come. [Even though the Torah promised there will always be fruit], @hh<HEB>בצורת@ee<ENG> can also mean that money will be scarce. Thus the Torah blesses you that you will be filled with the little food that you buy with a few coins. And thus it [the verse] is all one blessing. Rashi rejects this explanation of the verse, because if so, the verse could have omitted “you will live securely.” Because if it comes to explain why the food needs to be blessed in one’s stomach, people would in any case understand the reason when a shortage [of money] occurs, as [explained] above. Therefore, he explains that “You will live securely” refers to “the land will give its fruit,” and means that both fruit and money will be available so that there will never be any shortage. And if so, [the blessing] that “you will eat your fill” even by eating a little, is perforce another blessing, that you will have more than you need and be able to buy whatever items you want [by selling your surplus food]. (@ITR. Yaakov Taryosh@it) @p1[20]@p2<TIE>Into the house.@p3 And it is an expression of bringing [produce] into the house. You cannot say it means we did not gather [the produce] into a pile in the field, and that it means to gather to one place, because what does it help if the produce is gathered in a pile in the field and not brought into the house?
@d1Which grow on their own.@p3 Because once it is written “we have not planted,” why write the obvious fact that “we have not gathered our produce.”? Therefore, when it says “We have not gathered our produce,” it must refer to things like wine, fruit, and crops that do not need to be sown.
@p1[22]@p2<TIE>Tishrei is the season of gathering into the house.@p3 This implies that they did not eat from the produce until Sukkos. But above Rashi explained:, “’For three years,’ for part of the sixth, from Nisan until Rosh Hashanah and the seventh and eighth [years], since they would sow in the eighth during Marcheshvon, and harvest in [the following] Nisan.” This implies that they ate immediately in Nissan, which is an apparent contradiction. The answer is: Above (verse 20) it is written “If you shall say (ask).” I.e., “If you shall say (ask), ’What will we eat in the seventh year, for lo! we have not planted nor gathered our produce?’” The Holy One answers them, “I shall command (direct) My blessing to you.<TIE>.<TIE>. and it will produce [enough] for three years.” And as Rashi explains, “They would sow in the eighth during Marcheshvon, and harvest in [the following] Nisan.” [Thus, by Nissan their question regarding what they will eat will no longer apply]. But they actually did not eat [that produce] until the ninth year on Sukkos. So when it is written, “You will still be eating.<TIE>.<TIE>. until the ninth year,” it is saying even more. That the old produce will be enough not only for three years from Nissan of the sixth year until Nissan of the eighth year, but will even be enough until the end of the eighth year and the beginning of the ninth year. You will eat from it as you do every year when you eat from the old produce until Sukkos of the following year. @ITRe’m@it
@d1[However,] this verse was said regarding all other sabbatical cycles.@p3 (@ITGur Aryeh@it) You might ask, why does Scripture not write more, that it will produce for four years. The answer is that the verse is answering the people’s’ question regarding what they will eat. This question does not apply to the jubileeJubilee as they will not ask about one year [that only comes once every fifty years], as for one year people can make an effort to get produce. But for every sabbatical year it would be impossible.
@p1[23]@p2<TIE>The buyer should not hold it.@p3 In other words, the buyer should not hold it and refuse to return it, resulting in it being sold forever.
@d1For it is not yours.@p3 Rashi does not cite the reason written in the verse, that it “is Mine,” because for the reason the buyer should not hold it in his hand and refuse to return it to the owners is not because “the land is Mine.” Rather, the verse should have said: Do not begrudge returning it because the land is theirs, or because the land is not yours. Therefore Rashi writes, “For it is not yours.”
@p1[24]@p2<TIE>Houses [and] a Hebrew slave.@p3 Because if not so, why write “in @ITall@it”? Thus, it comes to include [the law] that even relatives may redeem houses of a walled city or a Hebrew slave who was sold to a Jew. [See @ITRe’m@it]
@d1Adjacent to the following section.@p3 @ITRe’m@it writes: “I do not know what forced him to say that it is adjacent to the following section, and not [connected] to the beginning of the same section (v. 15), and that it is telling us that the buyer cannot refuse; rather, ‘you shall grant redemption to the land.’” It seems that Rashi had to explain like this as he is answering the question: why do we need the verse “In all of your ancestral lands, etc.”? In the second [following] section in v. 25 it is written that the buyer cannot refuse? Therefore, he explains that this verse too is adjacent to the following section. Analyze this.
@p1[25]@p2<TIE>Proper behavior: that he should leave over some of his field.@p3 Because since he may only sell under pressure, why does the verse write “@ITsome@it of his ancestral land”? Since he is under pressure and has to sell, [why not sell] even all of it? Therefore he writes, “The (Torah) taught, etc.” I.e., even if he is under pressure, he should restrict his [expenses] to the best of his ability and not sell it all, but leave for himself, etc. This is easy to understand.
@d1And the buyer cannot impede [it].@p3 @ITRe’m@it writes: This is according to the opinion (Kiddushin 21a) @eethat [when the verse writes], “(a close relative comes) and redeems,” this is a voluntary (Kiddushin 21a). Therefore the verse “and redeems” is saying that the buyer cannot impede the redemption, because if not so, for what do I need “and redeems”? However, according to the opinion that [the relative has] an obligation [to redeem the field] this is no difficulty, as the verse is coming to obligate the closest relative to redeem it. But according to the opinion that it is voluntary, why do I need “and redeems”? Would you think that if he wants to redeem he is not allowed to? Perforce, it is telling us that the buyer cannot impede the redemption. @p1[26]@p2<TIE>Who has no redeemers.@p3 I.e., is there any Jew who receives a portion in the land who does not have redeemers from the seed of Yaakov?
@d1Who can redeem.@p3 I.e., because they are poor. @ITRe’m@it writes: But in Kiddushin (ibid.) it says, “Rather, this is someone who has [money] but does not want [to redeem], because he has permission [not to redeem].” [In fact], Rabbi Yehoshua [there] proves from this verse that the verse, “A@eend redeems that which his brother sold,” is voluntary. As he says there, “You [would] say it is voluntary. Or [perhaps] it is obligatory? The verse says, ‘If the man has no redeemer.’ Is there any person in Yisroel who has no redeemer? Rather, this is someone who has [money] but does not want [to redeem], he has the option [not to not redeem].” However, according to Rashi that having no redeemer means that he cannot afford it, this verse, “And redeems that which his brother sold,” @eewould be no proof that it is optional, as perhaps it is obligatory, and what is the meaning of the verse, “A@eend redeems that which his brother sold”? That he has no redeemer who can afford it. But if so, according to @ITRe’m@it, Rashi would be contradicting himself. Because above (verse 25) Rashi explains according to the opinion that it is voluntary [to redeem], as the @ITRe’m@it explained, while here he explains according to the opinion that it is obligatory [to redeem]. Though we often find that Rashi explains sometimes like one opinion and sometimes like another even when they are apparently contradictory, but that is [only] in two [different] places [in Scripture]. But[to make such a claim that Rashi does so] in the same place like here, presents a difficulty. Therefore, it seems, unlike @ITRe’m,@it that Rashi holds like the opinion that redemption is obligatory, and above too he learns that redemption is obligatory. You might ask: What is answered with this [Rashi’s answer]? Is there any Jew who has no redeemer wealthy enough to redeem his sale? The answer is that Rashi means as follows: He has no closest relative who can redeem his sale, since the obligation lies [only] on his closest relative, and that relative is not wealthy enough to redeem his sale. (@ITDivrei Dovid@it) In @ITparshas@it Naso (Bamidbar 5:8) Rashi asks this same question [regarding a case where there are no heirs to whom to return a stolen item], and he says that the verse there is speaking of a convert who has no heirs. That answer cannot be applied here in the case of an ancestral field, as a convert has no portion in the land of Yisroel. So answer @ITGur Aryeh@it and @ITMaharan.@it I have difficulty with this, as a convert could own an ancestral field by gaining permanent ownership of a field he bought from a Jew in a walled city. [This could happin in a case where] hHe bought it from him and the seller did not come to him [to redeem] it within its [first] year, and it [then] belongs to him permanently. Then the convert left the field to his son who was born a Jew. This law would be applicable if the son of the convert sold [the field] to a Jew, as there would be no paternal relatives to redeem it. The answer is: Rashi prefers to learn the verse according to its plain meaning, as talking of a regular Jew [whose closest relative] cannot afford to redeem.
@p1[27]@p2<TIE>This [original] seller who comes.@p3 Explanation: To the first buyer. Because if not, the seller of an ancestral field will sometimes lose, as perhaps when the first buyer buys for a hundred and then sells for two-hundred.
@p1[28]@p2<TIE>He may not redeem it by halves.@p3 Because if not, why does the verse write “enough”? Thus it must be telling us that if he has within his means enough to redeem the whole field, he redeems, and if not, [he does] not. @ITNachalas Yaakov@it asks: Why does Rashi not say this on the verse “And finds [it] enough to redeem it [himself]” above (verse 26)? Perhaps Rashi thinks that this is more obvious over here, as the verse concludes, “That which he sold remains in the possession of the buyer until the Jubilee year,” and returns nothing to him. This indicates that he may not redeem it by halves. But above it said that if he finds enough to redeem it, he should calculate with the buyer, and one could say that the same applies if he did not have enough to redeem it [all], that he redeems it according to the money he has. And that the verse is speaking of a normal case where he had [money] equal to the whole field. Therefore Rashi delayed his explanation until here.
@d1For the jubileeJubilee releases from its beginning.@p3 Erchin 28b. Rashi [there] explains, “At twilight of the [first] evening of the Jubilee year the sabbatical year ends, and at that time both of them release.” [I.e., the sabbatical year releases loans, and the Jubilee year releases sold lands].
@p1[29]@p2<TIE>Surrounded by a wall:@bo Explanation: It was first surrounded by a wall and then settled [with people]. He says “from the days of Yehoshua bin Nun,” because the verse is probably only speaking of a town surrounded by a wall at the time of the conquest when the land was first settled.
@d1[Referring to] the house (@HB<HEB>בית@BO<ENG>).@p3 But it is not referring to his sale of the house. It is not like “enough for its redemption” @eeabove (verse 26), which has to be translated as “the redemption of its sale (@hh<HEB>ממכר@ee<ENG>),” and it cannot mean “the redemption of the ancestral land (@hh<HEB>אחוזה@ee<ENG>)” since @hh<HEB>אחוזה@ee<ENG> is a word in the female form. Here, however, @hh<HEB>בית@ee<ENG> is a word in the male form. In addition, the word @hh<HEB>ממכר@ee<ENG> [connoting “sale”] is not mentioned in this verse that “its redemption” could refer to it. Therefore, it must mean the redemption of the house. (@ITRe’m@it)
@p1[30]@p2<TIE>Under the control of the buyer.@p3 I.e., even though it was in the hands of the buyer [beforehand], it was also under the control of the seller because he could still redeem it. [But now] it remains in the hand of the buyer, as the seller can no longer take it from his hand. @ITRe’m@it writes: You might ask: [Why does Rashi [say that “it will remain” refers to “its purchaser”]? Why does he not explain that “it will remain” refers to “in perpetuity,” that until now it was only acquired for a year in the purchaser’s hand, [but now it is acquired forever]? It seems that Rashi deduces this since it is written “in perpetuity to its @ITpurchaser@it.” “Its purchaser” is apparently superfluous as it is obvious that this refers to the purchaser. Thus, one can deduce from [the superfluous] “to its purchaser,” that the verse means “for its purchaser and not for its seller.” I.e., until now, the seller had the right to redeem it, but now, after the year has passedt, it left the jurisdiction of the seller, etc.
@p1[31]@p2<TIE>Without cost.@p3 I.e., without compensation. Because regarding an ancestral field it is taught in a Beraisa, “If [the buyer] used it for a year and the jubileeJubilee year arrived, he has to add another year for [the buyer] after the jubileeJubilee year [because generally one cannot redeem a field before two years have passed]. Therefore one needs the extra words “and it is released by the jubileeJubilee,” to teach that it goes out without cost, without adding [an extra year]. [See] Erchin 29b.
@p1[33]@p2<TIE>This “redemption” is an expression of “selling.”@bo @ITR. Noson@it wrote: I found written somewhere that the verse calls the selling here “redemption” because anything belonging to Levites once belonged to Israelites, since they received no portion or inheritance with the Israelites except the forty-eight towns the Israelites gave them in exchange for their service [in the Temple]. Therefore, when an Israelite buys from a Levite, it is as if he is redeeming it from him, as this inheritance too once belonged to the Israelites.
@d1An Israelite who buys a house.@p3 The “another interpretation” means as follows: @hh<HEB>ואשר יגאל@ee<ENG> means to actually redeem, an expression of actual redeeming and not an expression of buying, and it is referring to where it is written is written above, “T@eehe Levites shall have an eternal right of redemption@ee.” This verse is telling us that not only when an Israelite buys from a Levite can the Levite redeem it forever, but even when a Levite bought from a Levite the seller has eternal right of redemption.
@d1This is another @BImitzvoh.@bo I.e., according to the “another interpretation,” it is not connected to the “eternal right of redemption” of the previous phrase, as that refers to redeeming. However, according to the first interpretation, the entire verse discusses [the] one same subject [of selling to a Yisroel].
@d1Like fields.@p3 When Rashi says “They have [a rule] of redemption like fields,” and does not also say, “And they go out in the jubileeJubilee year like fields,” this is imprecise, since they too go out in the jubileeJubilee year, but Rashi only mentions one of these [points]. @ITRe’m@it writes: You might ask: The reasonis rationale that, “For the houses of the Levitic cities, etc.,” only applies when an Israelite buys from a Levite. However, when the buyers are Levites and this rationale does not apply, since it will remain in the hands of a Levite and their inheritance will not be removed,, perhaps [Therefore] perhaps this case has the law of houses of an Israelite walled city, etc. The answer might be: Since most people who buy from Levites are Israelites, as they are the majority, the Torah gives a rationale that applies to them and it is not concerned about the minority of buyers who are Levites. It seems to me that we learn that it makes no difference whether the buyers are Israelites or Levites from what the verse writes, “(This) is their ancestral lands @ITamong Bnei Yisroel@it.” Why write “among Bnei Yisroel”? This must come for us to expound that the inheritance of the Levites should remain whole as it was originally “among Bnei Yisroel.” And since you do not need this regarding Israelite buyers, you expound it regarding Levite [buyers], that they [the houses they buy] return in the Jubilee year.
@p1[34]@p2<TIE>It does not go out to the @BIkohanim.@bo @ITRe’m@it writes: You might ask: The Rrabbis need to bring a proof from “it is their perpetual ancestral land” that their fields cannot be sold forever. This is taught in a Beraisa of in @ITToras Kohanim@it that says, “Does ’it may not be sold’ refer to the treasurer selling it [saying that the treasurer cannot sell it forever], or does ’it may not be sold’ mean that it cannot be sold forever [by the Levite himself],” i.e., that the Levite cannot sell it [forever]? [The Beraisa continues]: “The verse says, ’It is their perpetual ancestral land,’ [which teaches that the Levite cannot sell it forever. Therefore, ’it may not be sold’ must be teaching that the treasurer cannot sell it forever.”] Since the Beraisa does not cite verse (33) “The Levites shall have an eternal right of redemption” [to prove that a Levite cannot sell their fields forever], this indicates that the Beraisa holds that the verses above are dealing with houses and towns and not with a field on the outskirts. But if so, why does the Beraisa not explain that “it may not be sold” teaches that the Levite cannot sell a field onf the outskirts [at all], and that the verses above [that allow him to sell] are talking only about houses and towns, and not about a field onf the outskirts? This question requires investigation. [S.ifsei Chachomim. answers]: It seems to me that this is how the Beraisa expounds the verse “It is their perpetual ancestral land.” If the Torah had not stated “it is their perpetual ancestral land,” I would think that when the Torah writes of the outskirts, “It may not be sold,” it [indeed] means that the Levite cannot sell his field onf the outskirts [at all], and that the verse “The Levites shall have an eternal right of redemption” is speaking of houses and towns and not of fields onf the outskirts. But now that it says “it is their perpetual ancestral land,” we derive through [a @ITgezeiroh shovoh@it] “ancestral land,” “ancestral land” from houses and towns, [that] just as houses can be sold, so too a field of the outskirts can be sold, the same as houses that cannot be sold forever. But if so, since we derive that houses and towns and a field of the outskirts all have the same law, why does the verse not combine them and write them together [in one verse]. Therefore one must say that “it may not be sold” must is certainly be teaching about the treasurer selling it [that he cannot sell it forever]. This also answers the second question of @ITRe’m@it regarding the Beraisa of the @ITToras Kohanim.@it 
@p1[35]@p2<TIE>And what is a “sojourner”?@bo Explanation: But [the verse does not mean] literally “a stranger @ITand@it [non-Jewish] sojourner” [i.e., a stranger who is a non-Jewish sojourner, because the word @hh<HEB>גר@ee<ENG> here refers to a proselyte who converted to Judaism] similar [the commandment] to not to cause anguish to a @hh<HEB>גר@ee<ENG> (see above 19:33), and “You are to love the [righteous] convert (@hh<HEB>גר@ee<ENG>)” (Devarim 10:19).@ee [@hh<HEB>גר@ee<ENG> here must be referring to someone who converted to Judaism] because in the beginning of the verse it@ee is written “If your brother becomes impoverished” and a @hh<HEB>תושב@ee<ENG> [i.e. if we translated @hh<HEB>גר ותושב@ee<ENG> as “a stranger and sojourner”] would not be considered your brother since he eats @ITneveilos,@it even though he fulfills the seven Noahide @ITmitzvos@it and he does not worship idols.
@p1[38]@p2<TIE>For whoever dwells in the land of Israel.@p3 (@ITGur Aryeh@it). The reason for this is well known. The Holy Land belongs to Hashem as it is written (Yechezkel 36:20), “These are the nation of Hashem and they went out of His land.” Therefore, when one dwells in the Land of Israel, the Holy One is his God. But outside the Land, because it is under the hand of the supernal [angelic] princes, someone whowhen on dwells outside the Land it is considered as if he serves idols. Since “In a multitude of people is the king’s glory” (Mishlei 14:28), someone who lives there, glorifies and honors foreign gods [by increasing the population there].
@p1[40]@p2<TIE>If the jubileeJubilee [year] met him.@p3 Explanation: There are four verses. One, “He shall serve you until the jubileeJubilee year,” which is speaking of someone who sold himself [into servitude] and whom the jubileeJubilee year met [and set free] before six years [of slavery had passed]. “Return to his own family” refers to someone sold by @ITbeis din@it whom the jubileeJubilee year met before six years. “Each man shall return to his family” (verse 10) refers to someone whose ear was pierced whom the jubileeJubilee year met before six years passed since his piercing, and “He then serves his master forever” (Shemos 21:6) [refers to someone] whom the jubileeJubilee year met after six years since his piercing. Beraisa first chapter of Kiddushin 15a.
@p1[41]@p2<TIE>This master is obligated to feed his children.@p3 (@ITKitzur Mizrachi@it) It is not talking about any sons, but [only] of sons whom the father is obligated to feed; i.e., until they are six years old.
@d1To the honor of his ancestors.@p3 It does not mean his ancestral land, because [if so,] once it is written “estate,” why write “ancestral”? In addition, the verse is not speaking of someone who sold his land. Rather, it means the honor of his ancestors, which means that people should not denigrate him for being a slave. (@ITDivrei Dovid@it).
@p1[44]@p2<TIE>If you say: “If so, etc.”@bo It seems that the verse is the source of this question. I.e., [the verse itself is hinting at the question], “If you say, etc.” Because if not so [that the verse is hinting at question], why does it say “@ITAnd@it your slaves (@hh<HEB>ועבדך@ee<ENG>)” with a @ITvav@it, connecting it to the above. Why do we need this? Therefore Rashi writes that there is a question here, and answers it.
@p1[45]@p2<TIE>Them you may buy.@p3 You might ask: Why does Rashi have to explain “Them you may buy”? The answer is: If he did not explain this, I would say that if they had slaves who were sold to them, you may buy those slaves from [among] them, [but the children of the sojourners you may not buy]. Therefore, Rashi explains, “Them you may buy.” I.e., you can buy even them. Another reason Rashi says “Them you may buy” is to say that one may buy the fathers of the sons and even more so the children. But simply understood, I would say that “from them” means one can buy the children of the fathers as slaves, but not the fathers themselves. Therefore Rashi explains, “’From them you may purchase [slaves].’ Them you may buy.” You may buy even the fathers themselves, like the children. [Alternatively], you might ask: Why did Rashi not explain this above in [the previous verse], “From them you may purchase slaves and maidservants?” The answer is: Above, Rashi does not have to explain anything because the verse itself explains, “From them you may purchase slaves and maidservants.” But here where the verse says nothing afterwards and I do not know to what “from them you may purchase” refers., Pperhaps it refers to animals and means as follows, “From them you may purchase animals.” Therefore Rashi has to explain, “Them you may buy.” (@ITRe’m@it) You might ask: How does Rashi know that “from them” means “them you may buy?” Perhaps “from them” simply means [buying their animals] and not [buying] them? The answer is: Above in @ITparshas@it Shemos (1:7), it is written, “The land was filled with them (@hh<HEB>אותם@ee<ENG>),” and Rashi explains “From them (@hh<HEB>מהם@ee<ENG>).” And it is obvious there that the meaning of @hh<HEB>אותם@ee<ENG> is ’from them.” Therefore, [Conversely] here too, @hh<HEB>מהם@ee<ENG> means “from them.”
@p1[48]@p2<TIE>Do not leave him to sink (@HB<HEB>שיטמע@BO<ENG>).@p3 I found in the name of the @ITAruch,@it that the Aramaic translation of @hh<HEB>מטמון@ee<ENG> (a hidden treasure) is @hh<HEB>טמוע@ee<ENG>. And in the @ITAruch@it I found, @hh<HEB>ויחפרוהו ממטמונים@ee<ENG>, (“They dig for it more than buried treasures)”) (Iyov 2:21), the Aramaic translation [of this] is @hh<HEB>מן טומעיא@ee<ENG>. @hh<HEB>כי בא השמש לּ@ee<ENG>, “Because the stun had set” (Bereishis 28:11), Targum Yerushalmi [translates this as] @hh<HEB>טמעת שמשא@ee<ENG>. Thus here Rashi means,means do not leave him until he is sunk among idolaters.
@p1[50]@p2<TIE>Who is in your power.@p3 Rashi is saying this out offrom logic. Because if it is speaking of a non-Jew who is not in your power, what can you do to him that results with the verse saying of him, “He then goes out in the jubileeJubilee year.”
@p1[53]@p2<TIE>While you look on.@p3 You might ask: How do I know whether his intent is to rule over him, to crush him? Above (verse 43) Rashi explained, “’You must not rule over him to crush him,’ refers to unnecessary labor, in order to torment him.” But here one cannot know, [as] perhaps it is necessary? You might also ask: Rashi explained above, “If you say: ’If so, by whom shall I be served?’” What is Rashi’s difficulty? One may use a Hebrew slave for whatever one needs? The answer is: When Rashi explains above, “’You must not rule over him to crush him,’ refers to unnecessary labor, in order to torment him,” he means as follows: “Do not say to him: ’Warm this glass for me,’ while not needing it; ’Hoe beneath this vine until I come.’” [The latter case is forbidden] even when necessary, as perhaps he will never come. If so, everything is answered. When Rashi explained, “If you say: ’If so, by whom shall I be served?’” this is because one may not use him even for necessary work, as Rashi explained. It also answers that which Rashi explained, “While you look on,” as you can see whether he is saying, “Do this work until I come.” This is called ruling over him even if it is necessary, since he said to him “until I come.”
@p1[1]@p2<TIE>Since my master commits sexual crimes.@p3 You might ask: I can understand [why Rashi mentions] idolatry and Shabbos [as they] are written here, in the verses of this section. But why does Rashi mention sexual crimes which are not mentioned in this section? The answer is: Even though the verses do not mention sexual crimes, it they hints at them by mentioning idolatry. As the Midrash says, “’Your two breasts, etc.’ (Shir Hashirim 4). [This hints] that the two Tablets correlated one to another, with one command corresponding to [the opposite] command. ’Do not commit adultery’ (Shemos 20:13) corresponding to ’You must not have any other gods’ (verse 3),” i.e., idolatry. Alternatively, this is based on the sages’ statement that Yisroel served idolatry only for the purpose of permitting immorality for themselves. Rashi mentions Shabbos since whoever desecrates Shabbos is considered as if he denied God’s Creation of heaven and earth, [which is like idolatry]. Alternatively, the master might buy the slave for homosexuality, which is a sexual crime.
@d1If he does not repent.@p3 (@ITGur Aryeh@it) @ITRe’m@it asks: Why does the verse mention a “foreign family” (verse 27)? If he is sold to idol worship itself (see Rashi there), how much more [will he be sold] to a non-Jew? I do not understand this question, as @ITRe’m@it should [also] have asked, why does the verse (ibid.) mention a “resident foreigner”? If he is sold to a non-Jew, how much more to a foreign resident, so why write “foreign resident”? However, the verse writes them all for the reason Rashi says, that the Holy does not bring them all onto upon him at once. So if it wrote “offspring” [i.e. idol worship] (verse 27), I would think that he was sold to the “offspring” first. But the Holy One does not do so; rather He brings it onto upon him gradually.
@d1The spreading out of hands and feet.@p3 You might ask: How does Rashi know this? Perhaps it is forbidden even in the Temple? The answer is: It is written in the verse, “A prostration stone you shall not set in your land upon which to prostrate oneself,” which implies that the Torah forbade this in your land, but did not forbid it in the Temple.
@p1[3]@p2<TIE>Behold, the fulfillment of the @BImitzvos @BOis mentioned.@p3 This is the correct text: “When the verse says, ‘And you will fulfill them,’ behold, the fulfillment of the @ITmitzvos@it is mentioned.” Therefore “If you follow My statutes@ee” means to labor in Torah with no particular intent, and “keep My commandments@ee” means to labor [in Torah] in order to keep and fulfill.
@d1That you should labor in [studying] Torah.@p3 Because it is written “follow” and not “study,” this teaches that you should follow the [intricate] exegesis of the Sages [which requires labor]. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) Rashi infers this from the word @hh<HEB>תלכו@ee<ENG>, as we find the expression @hh<HEB>הליכה@ee<ENG> [relating to Torah] in Yirmeyahu (9:1), “Because they left My Torah.<TIE>.<TIE>. and did not walk in it,” and also (55:1), “Ho, all who are thirsty go for water,” which refers to being occupied in Torah.
@d1In order to keep [in mind].@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Afterwards it is written, “I will provide your rains in their proper time,” implying that they should study Torah in order to receive reward. But do our Ssages not say, “Do not be like servants who serve the master in order to receive reward”? Therefore Rashi explains, “In order to keep [in mind] as it states: ’And you shall teach them and keep [in mind] to fulfill them.’” This indicates that while one is laboring in their [study], one should keep in mind to do all that is written in it.
@p1[4]@p2<TIE>At the time that it is not the habit of people to go out.@p3 You might ask: How does Rashi know this? Perhaps “in their proper time” means at the time you need rain? The answer is: Since it is written “@ITyour@it rain” instead of “rain,” this indicates it will be “your rain,” i.e., at the time you need it. If so, why does Scripture write “in their proper time”? To teach you, “At the time<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”
@d1On Friday nights.@p3 As it says in @ITArvei Pesachim@it (Pesachim 112b), that “in their proper time” refers to [the verse] above where it is written, at the end of @ITparshas Behar@it (26:2) “You shall keep My @ITShabbosos@it,” and [this is based on the rule that] they derive [new laws] from [the juxtaposition of verses]. See more about this later in @ITparshas@it Eikev.
@d1These are non-fruit bearing trees.@p3 Because it is written “trees of the field,” which is a superfluous [phrase]. Thus “of the field” implies trees that grow in the field that do not generally produce fruit. I.e., non-fruit bearing trees. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) Rashi is answering the question: We do not find that the bearing of fruit by non-fruit bearing trees was fulfilled, even though “the word of our God stands forever” (Yeshayahu 40:8) and cannot remain unfulfilled? He answers: Even though Israel did not merit to receivereceiving this blessing in this world, it will be fulfilled in the [Messianic] future, soon in our days.
@p1[5]@p2<TIE>You will occupy yourselves with the grape-harvest.@p3 Explanation: He is answering the question: It is no blessing if the threshing is delayed until close to the grape-harvest. Rashi answers, etc.
@d1Eating a little.@p3 See what I wrote in @ITparshas@it Behar.
@p1[6]@p2<TIE>Peace is equal to all [other blessings].@p3 Because above it is written “The earth shall give forth its produce@ee,” [which is] speaking about produce. And then, after the verse, “I will grant peace in the land,” it again writes, “You will eat the old [store] long kept,” which is also about produce, and “I will grant peace” is in the middle. Why is it written in the middle? Because it is equal to all [other blessings].
@d1He makes peace and creates all.@p3 Even though the verse does not say this, but rather “He makes peaces and creates evil” (Yeshayahu 45:7), they altered [the words] in order to use pleasant language as we say in Berachos (11b).
@d1[They will not] even pass.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: The verse should have said “No sword .<TIE>.<TIE>. shall come in your land.” In addition, it is already written “You will live securely.<TIE>.<TIE>. I will grant peace<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Therefore [the verse means], “Not only will they not come to war [upon you], but [they will not] even etc.”
@p1[7]@p2<TIE>Each before his fellow-soldier’s sword.@p3 Since it is not written “You will fell them before you by the sword.” Or it should have said “You will strike them by the sword.” Therefore, it means that they will fall by their fellow-soldier’s sword (@ITRe’m@it). Alternatively, normally a person strikes fleeing people from behind and they fall on their faces. If so, why does the verse write @hh<HEB>לחרב@ee<ENG> (lit. to the sword)? Therefore, it means [he will fall by] his fellow-soldier’s sword.
@p1[8]@p2<TIE>Of the weak.@p3 Since it is not written @hh<HEB>ורדפו חמשה מכם@ee<ENG> [placing @hh<HEB>מכם@ee<ENG> after the number] as it says afterwards, @hh<HEB>ומאה מכם רבבה@ee<ENG>, this alteration perforce indicates that @hh<HEB>מכם@ee<ENG> here does not have its plain meaning [of “from you”]. Rather, @hh<HEB>מכם@ee<ENG> means @hh<HEB>מך@ee<ENG> (weak), as in the verse (earlier 25:47), “while your brother becomes impoverished (@hh<HEB>ומך@ee<ENG>) by him,” which means poor. And a poor person is generally weak.
@d1Is this thus the proportion?@bo Would one not need five hundred men for a hundred thousand according to the calculation of five men for a hundred? I found in the name of Rav Yaakov of Orleans that he explains the verse as follows: Five of you will pursue one hundred, and a hundred times five men will pursue ten thousand. So I found.
@d1There is no comparison.@p3 @ITRe’m@it writes, You might ask: If so, regarding [non-Jewish] idolaters [pursuing Jews who sin], of whom it is written (Devarim 32:30), “How can one pursue a thousand, and two make ten thousand flee,” it should have said, “and two make two thousand flee”? The work book @ITImrei Noam@it asks this question and answers in the name of @ITRabbeinu Tam,@it that here it is talking of pursuing and killing as it is written, “Your enemies will fall before you by the sword.” Therefore five can only pursue and kill a hundred. There, however, there is no killing but only pursuing. It seems to me that although pursuit includes killing, this is not the case with fleeing. Therefore, regarding non-Jews, if one of them pursues and kills a thousand, two will kill two thousand and no more, and three will kill three thousand, and so on ad infinitum. But the Israelites are different as Rashi explains when he asks, “Is this thus the proportion, etc.” Regarding fleeing however, two men can make ten thousand flee, and two Jews can perhaps make double that number flee, as with Yonasan and his arms bearer. Perhaps my words include what the @ITImrei Noam@it says. See @ITTosfos@it Sotah 11a. (@ITDivrei Dovid@it) It is fitting to give some sort of rationale for the ratio of a hundred to ten thousand. It seems as follows: Since five people kill a hundred, when they are many, each one of the hundred [Jews] is like five and can kill a hundred. Thus, that hundred is capable of killing a hundred times hundred, namely ten-thousand.
@d1Not in a natural way.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Why does the Torah write about enemies falling twice, since before in v. 7 it [already] wrote, “They will fall before you .<TIE>.<TIE>. ” Therefore, etc.
@p1[9]@p2<TIE>To a king who hired workers .<TIE>.<TIE>. @bo They did not serve him faithfully, except for one who served him faithfully. When the workers came to receive their pay, that worker too came with them. The king said to him: “My son, I will turn my attention to you [later]. Because these worked for me a little I will give them a small wage, whereas I have a large calculation [to make] with you.” So is the Holy One. He pays the non-Jews’ wage swiftly. But when Israel comes, He turns away from all his [other] businesses since their wage is very large and He needs time to calculate with them to pay them for all their merits (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it). See what I wrote in @ITparshas@it Ki Sissa and in @ITparshas@it Acharei Mos.
@d1With increasing population.@p3 You might ask: Perhaps @hh<HEB>והפרתי והרבתי@ee<ENG> both refer to “fruitfulness and increase,” as everywhere [else] where @hh<HEB>פריה ורביה @ee<ENG> are written together? [Why then does Rashi translate @hh<HEB>והרבתי@ee<ENG> as “I will make you great”?]. The answer is since the Torah does not write @hh<HEB>והפריתי והרבתי אתכם@ee<ENG>, but rather, @hh<HEB>והפרתי אתכם והרבתי אתכם@ee<ENG>, this indicates that they are two separate things (@ITR. Noson@it). You might ask: Why the Sages do not exposit anything regarding Yishmael where it is written (Bereishis 17:20), “ And as for Yishmael I have heard you.<TIE>.<TIE>., and I will make @IThim@it fruitful, (and will increase @IThim@it exceedingly),” yet they do not expound anything from the [extra] word @IThim@it? The answer is: Regarding Yishmael the word @IThim@it is exclusionary: I will bless @IThim@it with the blessing of fruitfulness and increase, but I will not bless the sons of Keturah, even though they too were the sons of Avrohom. Analyze this.
@d1With an upright stature.@p3 @ITRe’m@it explains that if they are fruitful they will certainly increase. Therefore @hh<HEB>הרבתי@ee<ENG> must mean @hh<HEB>התרברבות@ee<ENG> (greatness), i.e., an upright stature.
@p1[10]@p2<TIE>Good [quality] to be aged.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: What blessing is it to “eat the old”?
@d1Full of new [crops].@p3 Because new crops generally cannot remain on the threshing floor as they will rot if they remain there, and therefore they must put them in the storehouses.
@d1To empty the storehouses.@p3 Rashi does not say that they throw the old crops away, because what blessing would that be? In addition, how would they eat “the old store long kept”? Furthermore, that verse indicates that old crops are better than new. Therefore, the verse perforce means to take [the old crops] from the storehouse and put them somewhere else in the house. Because the storehouse preserves the new crops from rotting, whereas the old crops do not rot easily once a year has passed.
@p1[11]@p2<TIE>This is the Temple.@p3 But not the Tabernacle, as implied, because there was no Tabernacle in the Land of Israel, only in the desert. [Alternatively], the first @ITsugyah@it of @ITMaseches@it Eiruvin (2a) writes, “It is all right to say that the Temple is called a Sanctuary, because it is written, “I will set My Sanctuary among you.” Rashi explains that when this verse was said the Tabernacle was already erected, since this verse appears in Vayikra and this whole book was [of Vayikra was dictated by God] in the Tent of Testimony [the Sanctuary] as it is written (Vayikra 1:1), “And Hashem spoke to him from the Tent of Meeting.” Therefore, concerning what [future] Tabernacle could he be promising them, if not the Temple, etc.etc? So far are Rashi’s words.
@p1[14]@p2<TIE>To know the expositions of the Sages.@p3 Explanation: Rashi is answering the question: Why does the Torah make a change? Before (26:3) it is written, “If you follow My statutes,” meaning that you should labor in Torah, while here it writes “If you will not listen to Me,” when it should have said, “If you do not follow My statutes.” This question is answered if the verse is also referring to “the exposition of the Sages,” as the exposition of the Sages is called “receipt,” since they received [the tradition] from each other [by listening to their teachers].
@d1Resulting in two sins.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: If they did not learn, obviously they will not know what to do? He answers: This is indeed what the verse is saying; since you will not learn, you will certainly not fulfill.
@d1Despise others who do perform [My statutes].@p3 Because if not so, it already written above “and you will not fulfill,” which is to despise the @ITmitzvos.@it If so, why does the verse need to say, “If you despise My statutes? Therefore, it must mean to despise others. This too is the explanation of [Rashi’s interpretation of] “[if] your souls loathe My laws.”
@d1You hate the Sages [lit. the wise ones].@p3 (@ITGur Aryeh@it) Why does the verse say “Your souls loathe My laws (@hh<HEB>משפטי@ee<ENG>)” regarding this, [and not “If you despise My statutes (@hh<HEB>חקותי@ee<ENG>)”]? Because [monetary] laws (@hh<HEB>משפטים@ee<ENG>) require wisdom [to understand]., This is as the Sages say (Bava Basra 175b), “He who wants to be wise should occupy himself with monetary laws.” And so they expounded (@ITSifri@it 9, 10) regarding Shlomo, “Would he, of whom it is said (Melachim I 5:11), ’He was wiser than any man,’ say (Melachim I 3:9), ’Who can judge this, Your great nation’?’” [This indicatesing that judging monetary laws requires wisdom and logic].
@p1[16]@p2<TIE>I will command against you.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: The term @hh<HEB>והפקדתי@ee@BO@bo<ENG> implies depositing, but “deposit” is not relevant here. Therefore, he explains that it is an expression of commanding.
@d1The appearance of his skin (lit. surface) is washed out.@p3 I.e., the appearance of the skin of swollen flesh is washed out [pale]; it is not red like the flesh of other, healthy people.
@d1Your enemies will consume [your crops].@p3 Rashi is answering the question: First it said “You will plant [your seeds] in vain,” which implies that they will not grow, and afterwards it says, “And your enemies will consume the crops,” which implies that they will grow? Alternatively, Rashi is answering the question:@ee How can one sow seed @hh<HEB>לריק@ee<ENG> (lit. on emptiness)? A person sows in the ground? He answers that “on emptiness” means that it will not grow, etc.
@p1[17]@p2<TIE>This is a deathly plague (@HB<HEB>מותן@BO<ENG>).@p3 Some explain that this is an expression of waiting (@hh<HEB>המתנה@ee<ENG>), that people will wait and expect the disease to leave him any moment and [they wait for] he will his recovery., and wWhen he dies, people will be alarmed (@hh<HEB>נבהלים@ee<ENG>) that he suddenly died. Others explain that it is an expression of @hh<HEB>מתניים@ee<ENG>, a disease that begins from the hips (@hh<HEB>מתניים@ee<ENG>), and this [terrible] disease alarms him. The expression of @hh<HEB>מותן@ee<ENG> [instead of @hh<HEB>מתניים@ee<ENG>] is similar to the expression (Kiddushin 22b) “The ear (@hh<HEB>אוזן@ee<ENG>) that heard on Mount Sinai, etc.,” where it should have said “ears” (@hh<HEB>אזניים@ee<ENG>). Here too, it means @hh<HEB>מתניים@ee<ENG>.
@d1[He sows it] the second year, and it grows.@p3 I.e., if it happens to grow the second time.
@d1For the days of siege.@p3 I.e., they gather produce to eat while they lay siege upon Jewish towns.
@d1Within [your cities].@p3 You might ask: From where does Rashi [know to] explain like this? “You will be stricken before your enemies” implies that they will kill them with the sword? The answer is: Rashi proves this from “I will set My face against you,” which implies that the verse is speaking of death by the hand of Heaven, i.e., excision. [This is], when a person dies prematurely on his bed as it is written in @ITparshas@it Kedoshim (above 20:5), “I shall set My face against that man and his family; I shall cut him off.” This indicates that wherever it is written “My face” it means excision. Yet after this it is written, “You will be stricken before your enemies,” which implies death atby the hand of man by the sword? Therefore, Rashi answers that it means as follows. When it says, “You will be stricken before your enemies,” it means that you will be killed within, by excision. And when it says “You will be stricken before your enemies,” it means that your enemies will surround you without, i.e., standing outside and rejoicing at their your death. Thus, you will be “stricken before your enemies.” Alternatively, [Rashi derives this] from @hh<HEB>ונגפתם@ee<ENG>, which is an expression of plague, a death by the hand of Hheaven.
@d1From you.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: It is already written “you will be stricken<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Therefore, this must come to be expounded upon. [Later], Rashi has to say the double expression “from you and over you” in his commentary, because the exposition indicates that the enemies will be “from you,” while the verse indicates that they will rule “over you.” Therefore he says both in his explanation.
@d1Because of panic.@p3 Because afterwards is written “when no one is pursuing.” If so, why will they flee? Perforce, only because of panic.
@d1Because of lack of strength.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Its its [not] a blessing if no one pursues them? He answers that [the enemy] will not need to pursue them, as they will have no strength. They will think, “Why pursue them? They have no strength to wage war.” [18] @ee@BOAnd if while these [are happening].@p3 Rashi is answering the question: @hh<HEB>ואם עד אלה@ee<ENG> (lit. if until these) implies that there is a time limit and the verse is saying that if the time passes and you still do not listen to Me, then I will increase your punishment. However, it is impossible to say that Hashem would set for them a time [until when they] transgress the commandments. Therefore he explains that @hh<HEB>עד@ee<ENG> is like @hh<HEB>עוד@ee<ENG> (while), because if not, the verse should have said, “If, you still do not listen to Me because (@hh<HEB>על@ee<ENG>) of these [catastrophes].”
@d1Still other sufferings.@p3 Not that ‘I will once again increase to bring the first sufferings onto them a second time’, since the second sufferings are not the same as the first.
@d1Seven punishments.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: The verse implies that the Holy One will punish them seven times for their sins, yet this cannot be as He does not punish a person more than he transgressed against Him.
@p1[19]@p2<TIE>Destroys its produce.@p3 Because [the land] is damp, its the fruits rots.
@p1[20]@p2<TIE>Who does not weed, nor harvest. @bo@hh<HEB>נוכש@ee<ENG> is to gather weeds from among the seedlings, @hh<HEB>כסח@ee<ENG> is to harvest, and @hh<HEB>עודר@ee<ENG> is to dig.
@d1Behold the teeth of such a one are set on edge.@p3 Thus “Your strength will be exhausted in vain” means after this labor and effort, since then the teeth of such a one are set on edge. If “your strength” meant their money that comes from [exerting] strength [effort], the verse need not have mentioned this, as Scripture had already written, “I will make your heavens like iron,” and probably they exhausted [their money] in vain. (@ITGur Aryeh@it) You also cannot say it means that their physical strength will be exhausted, because if so it need not have said “in vain,” but [simply], “Your strength will be exhausted.”
@d1What you bring to it.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Why is it written “@ITyour@it land”? It should have written “@ITThe@it land will not yield,” as above in the blessing (verse 4), “The earth shall give forth its produce.” Therefore, “your land” implies even what you bring to it of your own at the time of seeding; even this it will not yield. Alternatively, Rashi infers this from the word @hh<HEB>יבולה@ee<ENG> (produce), which connotes moving something (@hh<HEB>מוביל@ee<ENG>), [implying] that he brings [seed]. (@ITRe’m@it)
@d1Even from the very earth a curse will be upon them.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: It should have said “And the tree will not give forth its produce”! Why write “of the land”?
@p1[22]@p2<TIE>An expression of inciting.@p3 Because [the other meaning of @hh<HEB>והשלחתי@ee<ENG>] “sending on a mission” only applies to [a human] who has intellect.
@d1I will set (@HB<HEB>אשלח@BO<ENG>) upon them.@p3 And here too it writes “I will send (@hh<HEB>והשלחתי@ee<ENG>) among you,” giving us a @ITgezeiroh shovoh.@it 
@d1There were indeed years.@p3 Rashi mentions this so that you do not ask: Where do we find that a domesticated animal killed with its bite? He cites an incident that there were indeed, etc.
@d1These are minors.@p3 The death of one’s children when they are minors is called @hh<HEB>משכל@ee<ENG> as we find byin the case of Rivkah who said (Bereishis 27:45), “Why should I lose (@hh<HEB>אשכל@ee<ENG>) both of you on one day?” At that time they [Yaakov and Eisav] were minors. See @ITparshas@it Toldos.
@d1Within.@p3 Rashi alters his wording and says “within” regarding people. He is answering the question: Why did it not [simply] write “I will destroy your cattle and you”? The answer is: The wild animals will completely destroy the cattle that are outside in the field. But since people are within, inside the town, the wild animals will not destroy them all, but will only reduce them.
@p1[23]@p2<TIE>To return to Me.@p3 Because the expression @hh<HEB>לא תוסרו לי@ee<ENG> (lit. do not accept your sufferings) is problematical, as people obviously do not want to accept sufferings [and they sufferings are given to people whether they want them or not]. Therefore Rashi explains: If, despite all these sufferings, you do not want to return to Me.
@p1[25]@p2<TIE>There is “avenging” .<TIE>.<TIE>. @bo I.e., “I will bring an avenging sword upon you avenging the covenant,” implies the sword written in the covenant, i.e., the Torah. But there is another avenging not [mentioned] in the covenant, and that is the blinding of Tzidkiyohu.
@d1The blinding of Tzidkiyohu.@p3 Blinding is not written in the Torah. Alternatively, “avenging the covenant” refers to Tzidkiyohu who made an oath [covenant], [then] transgressed the oath, and was blinded. And “other avengings” means cases where people transgressed the Torah’s commands such as theft and immorality, [where one does not transgress a specific covenant. Rashi is saying as follows: “There is ’avenging’ which is not for the (violation of a) covenant, such as with other avengings, while this (case of our verse) is the blinding of Tzidkiyohu.]
@d1Which you have transgressed.@p3 I.e., the Torah [according to the first interpretation].
@d1Enemy armies.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: How can a sword on its own strike them? Why does Rashi not explain this above in v. 6 where it said, “No sword shall pass through your land”? The answer is: Above it is written “I will grant peace in the land.” Since peace is the opposite of war, as it is written (Tehillim 120:7), “I am for peace, but when I speak they are for war,” [“sword” of that verse] certainly refers to an armed force [i.e., war]. Here, however, no enemy is mentioned as it is only written, “I will bring an avenging sword upon you.” Therefore, he explains that “sword” refers to an army of enemies.
@d1When they take out.@p3 Because otherwise, how is pestilence relevant to “You will be given into the hand of the enemy”? Even though did every evil, they did not leave the dead overnight because the [holy] Land is unable to bear it and the corpse immediately gives off a stench if left overnight.
@p1[26]@p2<TIE>I will break for you.@p3 Rashi needs to explain that @hh<HEB>בשברי@ee<ENG> means “I @ITwill@it break,” because the [literal] meaning of @hh<HEB>בשברי@ee<ENG> is “when I break,” but the intent here is “I @ITwill@it break” and not “when I break.”
@d1For lack of wood.@p3 @ITGur Aryeh@it explains that you cannot say it is for lack of bread, because it is already written “When I break the staff of your bread.” But, this is no proof, because “staff of bread” can refer to anything that gives sustenance (@hh<HEB>הסועד@ee<ENG>), as every meal (@hh<HEB>סעודה@ee<ENG>) is called [bread] because of bread [which sustains most of all]. This is clearly indicated in Rashi who writes “every support (@hh<HEB>מסעד@ee<ENG>) of food.” Rashi’s proof [that the verse refers to lack of wood] seems to be because it is not written “Ten women will knead one @ITdough@it,” which occurs before baking. This indicates that even though they have flour and each woman can make dough by herself, they are unable to bake [separately for lack of wood]. This is easy to understand. (@ITR. Yaakov Taryosh@it)
@d1“And you will be given [into the hand of the enemy]” is not of that number.@bo Because otherwise, there would be eight. Rather, it is [the same as] “the sword” written in the beginning of the verse. And its explanation is: through the sword, that is, the enemy armies, you will be given into the hand of the enemy through pestilence [that breaks out during the siege].
@p1[30]@p2<TIE>And he would fall [dead] upon it [the idol].@bo Rashi is explaining how the verse can say, “I will set your corpses upon the carcasses of your idols,” implying that the people fall on their idols when they are already dead.
@p1[32]@p2<TIE>This is [actually] a kindly measure for Israel.@p3 @eeRashi is answering the question: Why is this not counted among the punishments, making them eight? Therefore he explains: “This is a kindly measure, etc.” Do not ask: Why does Rashi not include the even harsher “I will scatter you among the nations, etc.” among the punishments? The answer is: Once the verse interrupted with a kindly measure, it is not counted as being part of the above mentioned punishments. This is not like @ITRe’m@it who explains: “This is a kindly measure.:” Rashi is telling us the truth of the matter and is not saying that if it was not a kindly measure, but a punishment, there would be eight [punishments]. Because if so, you could ask that since “I will scatter you among the nations” is a measure of punishment, there would [still] be eight. Therefore one must say that once the number of seven is complete, the Torah is not particular if there are eight [punishments or for that matter] other punishments in addition to the seven. So far are his words. [Alternatively,] Rashi is answering the question: Why does Scripture write, @hh<HEB>והשימותי אני@ee<ENG> and not [simply] write @hh<HEB>והשימותי את הארץ@ee<ENG> as it is written in v. 31, @hh<HEB>והשימותי את מקדשיכם@ee<ENG> without writing @hh<HEB>אני@ee<ENG> (Myself)? This indicates [the direct involvement of] the Holy One Himself. But, being that no evil comes from Him as “evil does not come from the Most High,” therefore Rashi has to explain, “This is [actually] a kindly measure.”
@d1For their enemies will not find any satisfaction.@p3 I.e., when the verse writes “Your enemies who live on it will be desolated@ee,” it means that they will not be able to live in your land because of the desolation. [It means] that they will not be able to live in your land because of the desolation.
@p1[33]@p2<TIE>The scabbard is emptied.@p3 Because the expression of @hh<HEB>ריק@ee<ENG> (empty) is not applicable to a sword as Rashi explains in @ITparshas@it Beshalach. @hh<HEB>הנדן@ee<ENG> is the sheath of the sword.
@d1As a person who empties.@p3 And therefore it is written @hh<HEB>והריקותי@ee<ENG>.
@d1It does not return.@p3 I.e., the water.
@p1[34] It will appease the wrath of God.@p3 @ITRe’m@it writes: Rashi’s explanation, “It will appease the wrath of God,” is not referring to the word @hh<HEB>תרצה@ee<ENG>, because @hh<HEB>תרצה@ee<ENG> is a verb referring to the subject [the land which will be appeased], while “It will appease the wrath of God” is a verb referring to an object, meaning that the land will appease the wrath of God. Rather, “It will appease the wrath of God” is the explanation of @hh<HEB>והרצת את שבתותיה@ee<ENG> (and appease for its Shabbosos) which is written at the end of the verse. But @hh<HEB>תרצה@ee<ENG> means to be appeased, i.e., “The land will then be appeased for its Shabbosos.” Because the purpose of the land’s appeasement is in order so that it will then appease God, Rashi writes this purpose at the very beginning, by saying, “It will appease the wrath of God.” Proof to this is that regarding @hh<HEB>והרצת@ee<ENG> Rashi explains “the King,” meaning that the word “King” is missing, whereas regarding@hh<HEB>תרצה הארץ@ee<ENG> he does not explain that the word “King” is missing and says, “It will appease the King of His wrath.” Therefore, one must say that above he is only explaining the verse’s intent when he says, “It will appease the wrath of God.” (@ITGur Aryeh@it) The word @hh<HEB>תרצה@ee<ENG> is similar to the word @hh<HEB>פיוס@ee<ENG>, appeasement. Rashi says “It will appease the wrath of God,” since he cannot explain that it will appease the wrath of the sabbatical years, because it is not feasible to appease sabbatical years that they already transgressed. Rather, they will appease the wrath of God who is angry about the sabbatical years. But @hh<HEB>והרצת את שבתותיה@ee<ENG> is a verb applying to an object, since the verse does not write @hh<HEB>ותרצה שבתותיה@ee<ENG> as in the beginning of the verse. Therefore it means “It will appease its Sabbatical years to the King,” since it is a verb applying to an object, that the land will appease the King regarding the sabbatical years.
@p1[35]@p2<TIE>You will lie on your right side [again]”ùforty days.”@bo Forty days hints at the forty years that Judah remained behind after the exile of the ten tribes.
@d1And if you say Menashe’s years were fifty-five.@p3 I.e., Menashe was born immediately after the exile of the ten tribes and he lived for fifty-five years, and we find that Menashe was wicked. If so, during Menashe’s years the people angered Him for fifty-five years, in addition to what they angered Him during the years of the other kings. Rashi answers, “Menashe repented.”
@d1And on them was decreed [an exile] of seventy complete years.@p3 There was an exile of seventy complete years, even though only sixty-eight sabbatical years and jubilee years passed over them. The reason the Holy One did not wait until seventy years passed was because He acted righteously with them, as Rashi explains in @ITparshas@it Va’eschanan on the verse “When you have children .<TIE>.<TIE>. ” (Devarim 4:25).
@p1[36]@p2<TIE>As though the pursuers<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo [We read the verse] as if it said, “And they will flee as though fleeing from a sword,” and not “(And they will flee), fleeing from the sword,” because afterwards it is written, “With no one chasing them.”
@d1In tapping it.@p3 Because @hh<HEB>נדף@ee<ENG> means @hh<HEB>נדחף@ee<ENG> (pushed). However, a pushed leaf only produces a noise when it is pushed against another leaf; also, a leaf is not pushed of itself but only by the wind. Therefore Rashi explains this at length, citing proofs. When Rashi cites the Targum who translates @hh<HEB>שקיף@ee<ENG>, i.e., beating, Rashi is not saying that @hh<HEB>נדף@ee<ENG> means beating, since @hh<HEB>נדף@ee<ENG> is an expression of pushing. Rather, he means that the pushing causes beating, and the Targum is explaining the verse’s intent and not the actual word; such is the way of the Targum when explaining the meaning in many places. [In some texts], Rashi first explains that “They will flee, fleeing from a sword” does not mean actual fleeing from a sword, so that the explanation of “The sound of a driven leaf” applies to it. That the reason they are fleeing is not because of an enemy killing them, but because of the great fear in their hearts. (@ITRe’m@it) 
@p1[37]@p2<TIE>One by the sin of the other.@p3 And “As though before a sword” means, just as one stumbles before a sword that pursues after him so he will stumble because of his fellow’s sin (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it citing @ITToras Kohanim@it). I think the verse is giving a reason for what was said above. Since v. 36 is speaking of “those who survive among you” who are apparently righteous, why then are they punished by “timidity in their hearts,” and that “The sound of a blown leaf will put them to flight and they will flee .<TIE>.<TIE>. and fall?” Rashi answers, “They will stumble over one another”ùone by the sin of the other, since all Israel is responsible for one another.” Therefore, He will bring these punishments upon them. @ITGur Aryeh@it explains that [this interpretation is deduced] because it says, @hh<HEB>איש באחיו@ee<ENG> (lit. man against his brother). It should have said “one man against [another] man” or “one man against another,” since it is inappropriate to mention brotherhood in connection with falling [against one another]. But regarding sin it is fitting to write “his brother,” because the reason they will stumble against each other is that all Israel are brothers [i.e., all Israel is responsible for one another].
@p1[38]@p2<TIE>When you will be scattered you will be lost.@p3 But not really lost, because it is written (v. 44), “All this notwithstanding .<TIE>.<TIE>. to annihilate them.”
@p1[39]@p2<TIE>When they hold onto the deeds of their ancestors.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Why does it say “with them”? He is also answering the question: The Torah says, “Fathers shall not be executed through sons, (and sons shall not be executed through fathers)?” Therefore, he explains, “When they hold<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”
@p1[41]@p2<TIE>I Myself will bring them.@p3 Explanation. Because it is written “I will bring them” instead of “I will lead them” as in the verse (Devarim 28:36), “Hashem will lead you and your king,” perforce, it is expounded that He will “bring them” under His wings while they are in the land of their enemies.
@d1If then they will be humbled.@p3 @ITRe’m@it writes: I do not understand Rashi’s intent here. Because according to this, the verse means that I Myself will bring them under the wings of the Divine Presence if their uncircumcised heart is humbled. But if their heart is not humbled I will not bring them under the wings of the Divine Presence. And this is the opposite of the Midrash that he cited, “Surely.<TIE>.<TIE>. with fury poured out, will I be king over you.” I will assert My kingship over you by force. But Rashi should have explained @hh<HEB>או אז@ee<ENG> (or then) according to its literal meaning: Either I will bring them under the wings of My Divine Presence by force, or then their hearts will humble of themselves and I will not need to bring them under the wings of My Divine Presence by force. So far are @ITRe’m’s@it words. This [way of understanding Rashi] is difficult as Rashi in @ITparshas@it Mishpatim explains, “@ITOr@it it was not a @hh<HEB>תם@ee<ENG>, but rather it was known that it is a goring ox,” [and thus probably learns that expression similarly over here]. I think that this is the explanation of Rashi: [Rashi omits a few words at the beginning, and is actually learning @hh<HEB>או@ee<ENG> as meaning “or”]: “Or I will not have to rule over them by force, if then they humble their uncircumcised heart of themselves, and then confess their sins and their iniquities are atoned through suffering. If they do this, “I will [then] remember My covenant, etc.” The meaning of @hh<HEB>או אז יכנע@ee<ENG> will be as Rashi explained in @hh<HEB>או נודע כי שור נגח הוא@ee<ENG> above. This also explains the “other interpretation” of Rashi. Analyze this.
@d1With their sufferings.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: What will appease their iniquities? He answers that appeasement refers to the suffering that will atone for their iniquities.
@p1[42]@p2<TIE>A pledge, that he should come.@p3 I do not know why five places [were necessary], since one would be enough. Perhaps this was as if he swore by the five books of the Torah, just as [the word] Israel is written five times in one verse (Bamidbar 8:19) corresponding to the five books of the Torah; @ITRe’m.@it It seems to me as follows: the Yalkut states that before the coming of Moshiach, Eliyohu will arrive first and reveal himself to individual righteous people, afterwards in a few towns and communities, and afterwards upon the mountains of Israel, etc. The Yalkut Yeshaya comments on the verse (Yeshayahu 52:7), “How pleasant are the feet of the bearer of good tidings on the mountains,” that three days before the arrival of Moshiach, Eliyohu will come and stand on the mountains of Israel .<TIE>.<TIE>.  and his voice will be heard from the one end of the world to the other .<TIE>.<TIE>.  On the second day he will stand on the mountains of Israel .<TIE>.<TIE>.  And on the third day .<TIE>.<TIE>.  Thus he will come to announce the good tidings five times. Israel will then make a great repentance as it says in the Yalkut at the end of Malachi in the name of R. Eliezer. Therefore, he has to give a pledge five times in order to [guarantee that he will] come and announce good tidings five times (@ITR. Yaakov Taryosh@it). (@ITKitzur Mizrachi@it) @ITMaharan@it writes in the name of @ITTzror Hamor,@it that he [specifically] took a @ITvov@it so that he should come to redeem in the sixth millennium, soon in our days. @ITGur Aryeh@it gave another reason at length. (@ITDivrei Dovid@it) He explains that he took a @ITvov@it as his name would still be pronounced as Yaakov without change, whereas if he had taken another letter, the name Yaakov would be corrupted and no longer be pronounced as Yaakov.
@d1And why is “remembrance” not said [in connection] with Yitzchok.@p3 (@ITDivrei Dovid@it) [Rashi] seems [to be saying] that this question only arises now, since if not for his answer [as to why the patriarchs are listed in reverse order], I would think the verse means that only through combination, [i.e.,] that only the remembrance of all three together will cause [the redemption]. If so, one need not mention “remembrance” with Yitzchok, because [remembrance] is mentioned at the beginning and end of the [one] combination and it is not necessary [for it to be inserted] in the middle. But now that that the verse is making two statements, first that Yitzchok will combine with Yaakov, and then, if this combination is insufficient, He will also combine with Avrohom, therefore Rashi asks why no remembrance is said with Yitzchok pertaining to the first combination.
@p1[43]@p2<TIE>[As] retribution and in retribution.@p3 Because @hh<HEB>יען@ee<ENG> always means retribution. Rashi also adds the word @hh<HEB>אשר@ee<ENG> (that) since without it, the words “As retribution and in retribution” would not be connected with “They despised My laws.” It is as if the verse said, “As retribution that they despised My laws and in retribution that their soul loathed My statutes.”
@p1[2]@p2<TIE>On which the soul depends.@p3 [This comes] to exclude a hand or a leg upon which the soul does not depend, [e.g.,] if he said, “the worth of [his] hand or leg [is incumbent upon me],” it is as if he said nothing and he is absolved from making payment.
@p1[3]@p2<TIE>But rather, whether he is worth much or little.@p3 I.e., other items whose monetary value is dedicated to the Temple, where, if the donor said, “The money of so and so is on me,” we calculate according to the high or low value at that time. This dedication, however, is not so, but rather [it is calculated] according to his years written in this section.
@d1And as to the doubling of the @BIkof@BO, I do not know.@p3 @ITRe’m@it writes: This is surprising as in @ITToras Kohanim,@it cited in the first chapter of Erchin (4a), it explicitly says that this is a @ITkaf@it of @ITkinui@it [a pronominal suffix, “@ITyour@it value”): “It was taught in a Beraisa, @hh<HEB>בערכך@ee<ENG>, ’according to your value.’ One gives the value of a person’s whole body and one does not give the value of his limbs. Since you might think I exclude the value of a limb that the soul depends on, the verse says, ’souls.’.” We see that the meaning of @hh<HEB>בערכך@ee<ENG> is the value of one’s whole body and from this [word] they derived [that one] cannot [dedicate] not the value of part of him, and they [also] said, ‘not the value of his limbs’. So far are his words. I do not understand his difficulty with Rashi, since Rashi is writing about the other appearance of @hh<HEB>ערכך@ee<ENG> in the section where the explanation of our Sages is not applicable at all [since they derive it from the first mention of this word]. You cannot say that since one is for an exposition, for this reason the Torah wrote the rest as @hh<HEB>ערכך@ee<ENG> because of this even where this exposition of the Sages is not relevant at all., as Rashi thinks it this is a strained explanation.
@p1[7]@p2<TIE>An old man in the houseùa snare (@HB<HEB>פחא@BO<ENG>) in the house.@p3 Like the expression “a net (@hh<HEB>פח@ee<ENG>) that snares” (Tehillim 91:3). I.e., it is bad to have him in the house.
@d1An old woman in the houseùa treasure (@HB<HEB>סימא@BO<ENG>) in the house.@p3 A good treasure. The Targum translates @hh<HEB>ומטמוני מסתרים@ee<ENG>, “secret hidden things” (Yeshayahu 45:3) as @hh<HEB>סימא דמטמרן@ee<ENG>.
@p1[9]@p2<TIE>“The foot of this [animal] is a burnt-offering,” his statement is binding.@p3 But not so regarding the evaluation of a person since we require something on which life depends, because it is written “souls” regarding a person. But here it is written “any of it that he will give,” to include @ITwhatever@it he dedicates as becomes dedicated.
@p1[10]@p2<TIE>An unblemished one for one which has a blemish.@p3 I.e., he may not give an undedicated unblemished animal in place of an already dedicated one which has a blemish. You might ask: How does Rashi know this? Perhaps the verse means according to its plain meaning, a fat one for a thin one? The answer is: We find elsewhere regarding sanctified animals that it is written @hh<HEB> רע@ee<ENG>and “blemish” is written next to it, indicating that wherever it says ‘bad’ regarding sanctified animals, it means a blemish. Because it is written in @ITparshas@it Re’ey (Devarim 15:21), “And if it has a blemish, if it is crippled or blind, or has any severe (@hh<HEB>רע@ee<ENG>) blemish.”
@d1And certainly (@HB<HEB>כל שכן@BO<ENG>) [the exchange of] good for good or bad for bad.@p3 You might ask: Why is this a @hh<HEB>כל שכן@ee<ENG>?” Perhaps one may only not change a bad undedicated [animal] for a good dedicated one, but if they are both good, this @hh<HEB>כל שכן@ee<ENG> does not indicate that it is forbidden? Also, why does the Torah need to write “a good one for a worse one”? This would be a @hh<HEB>כל שכן@ee<ENG> as even a bad one for a good one is forbidden? Also, why does Rashi explain “certainly good for good” when discussing “a bad one for a good one”? He should have explained this while discussing “a good one for a bad one”! The answer is: He means as follows. The verse certainly has to write “or a bad one for a good one” because of the end of the verse where it says, “If he did exchange, etc., then both it and its replacement shall be sacred.” This indicates that after the act they are both sacred. Therefore the Torah needs to write “a bad one for a better one” to include that even if one gives a bad one in exchange for something better that was dedicated, where one may have thought it does not become sanctified at all, the verse lets us know that if one made such an exchange it is holy, since the end of the verse refers to both cases. And now that even a blemished one exchanged for an unblemished one, the blemished one becomes sacred, so then exchanging an unblemished one for an unblemished one, will certainly become sacred since both are good. You might ask: Why does Rashi [also] mention “bad for bad”? The answer is that you might have said this only works if one exchanges good for good because the sanctity of the good one has the power to fall on its exchange. However, if one exchanged bad for bad you might have thought that the sanctity of the blemished animal does not have the power to fall [on its exchange]. So Rashi tells us [that it does], because it is also written “a good one for a bad one.” Analyze this. See @ITRe’m@it who discusses this at length, asking many questions.
@p1[11]@p2<TIE>A blemished [animal].@p3 Rashi’s proof of this is from the end of the section (verse 27) where it is written, “If it is of an unclean animal<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” There one is has to say that it is speaking of an actual unclean animal, and it is connected to this verse [which speaks of exchanging animals for animals], as Rashi explains there. If so, this indicates that [here] it is speaking of a blemished animal (@ITRe’m@it). Alternatively, Rashi derives this since it is written, “Which cannot be offered to Hashem.” This is superfluous as it is obvious that one cannot offer unclean animals to Hashem. Thus it teaches that the verse is speaking of a blemished animal.
@p1[12]@p2<TIE>For other people who come to buy it from Temple property.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Initially it is written “As the @ITkohein@it determines its value for you, so shall it be,” but then [in the next verse] it is written “If he will indeed redeem it he shall add on one fifth to its valuation”? Rashi answers: Here it is speaking of another person who comes to buy it, and there [in the next verse it is speaking] of owners who want to redeem it. @ITGur Aryeh@it explains: But [here it is not speaking of] the owners, because the owners [who redeem it] have to add a fifth. You might ask: Just because it belonged to him before [why does] he haves to add a fifth? The explanation is that because it was his before, he is more satisfied [when he purchases it back], as it states everywhere (e.g., Bava Metzia 93b), “The difference [between keeping one’s own animals or having to buy new ones] is that his animals are accustomed to work for their owner, [i.e., it is easier for the owner to work with such animals].” Explanation:, a person prefers his first animal. Therefore, he has to add, because it is worth more to him. And the same applies to one who sanctifies his house. However, we still need to understand, why a fifth. According to teachings of wisdom, a second is not considered an addition to one, and a third is not considered an addition to two, and a fourth is not considered an addition to three. This is because [only] a plane is considered a complete [entity] as it has four corners. Therefore, a fourth portion is not considered an addition. But a fifth portion is considered an addition because a complete item is four. Therefore, one has to add a fifth portion.
@p1[16]@p2<TIE>Not according to its worth.@p3 Explanation: “According to the measure of its seed” means according to the amount of seed he can sow in it. I.e., according to its size and not according to its worth, since if it is big enough to sow in it a @ITchomer@it of seed, even if it is inferior, he has to give the amount written in the @ITparsha.@it
@p1[17]@p2<TIE>According to this assessment mentioned shall it be.@p3 Explanation: Rashi substitutes the word @hh<HEB>יקום@ee<ENG> (established) with @hh<HEB>יהיה@ee<ENG> (it will be), because the verse is referring to the giving [of money], and not saying that the field should be established in the hand of the person who presently has it. And [because] the word @hh<HEB>יקום@ee<ENG> [generally] cannot be explained as “giving something,” Rashi explains that @hh<HEB>יקום@ee<ENG> means @hh<HEB>יהיה@ee<ENG>. Because this word (@hh<HEB>יהיה@ee<ENG>) can either be translated as meaning that it shall “it shall be established where it is” [i.e., @hh<HEB>יהיה@ee<ENG> can have the same meaning as @hh<HEB>יקום@ee<ENG>], or [it can mean] that “it shall be according to the amount he gives,” which is connected to giving.
@p1[18]@p2<TIE>And it remains in the possession of the [Temple] treasurer.@p3 Explanation: When the verse says, “The @ITkohein@it shall calculate the money,” and that he does not give the whole fifty shekels, this is not only when the dedication was after the jubilee year. It also applies when the dedication was immediately after the jubilee year in a case where the redeemer only came to redeem it a few years after his dedication. The verse wrote one case and the same applies to someone who came a few years after his dedication.
@d1A @BIkalbon @BO(small sum).@p3 I.e., an additional amount for each @ITsela@it [acquired in exchange for smaller coins, because small coins are more valuable]. @hh<HEB>פרוטרוט@ee<ENG> is similar to the word @hh<HEB>פרוטה@ee<ENG> (the small @ITperutah@it coin), i.e., small coins [lit. little by little].
@d1That are from the jubilee year.@p3 Because it was in the hands of the Temple during those years, we count from [after] those years. Because the amount the redeemer must give is only according to number [of years] from the year of redemption until the jubilee year, when the redeemer eats its fruits. But not according to the number of years from the jubilee year until the year of redemption when he does not eat its fruits.
@p1[20]@p2<TIE>The Temple treasurer.@p3 Explanation: He is the seller and not the ‘one who dedicated’ mentioned above.
@d1To return to.@p3 In the jubilee year.
@p1[21]@p2<TIE>From the possession of the one who bought it from the Temple treasury.@p3 Explanation: But not from possession of the Temple treasury, because we do not find anywhere that the Torah commands that the field leaves the possession of the Temple treasury at in the jubilee year, so how could it say, “When the field is then released<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”?
@d1Which is given to the @BIkohanim@BO.@p3 Because the expression “It becomes sacred to Hashem” is said in reference to the Temple upkeep and also in reference to the @ITkohanim,@it Rashi now explains, “’Just as a field that was consecrated,’ which is given to the @ITkohanim@it.”
@p1[25]@p2<TIE>Must be in holy @BIshekolim@BO.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: The verse implies that no valuation is less than a @ITshekel,@it but this is not true since we assess him according to his means and leave him enough to live on, as said earlier (verse 8).
@d1Twenty-four @BImo’oh@BO to the @BIsela@BO.@p3 Because the @ITsela@it is four @ITdinar@it, and the @ITdinar@it is six @ITmo’oh.@it Thus there are twenty-four @ITmo’oh@it to the @ITsela.@it
@p1[27]@p2<TIE>This verse does not refer to .<TIE>.<TIE>. Rather, the verse refers to<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 @ITGur Aryeh@it asks: Why does it interrupt between them, writing the @ITparshah@it of dedication of a house and inherited field between them? Why does it not juxtapose [the exchanging of an] animal to [the exchanging of an] animal? The answer is that it is juxtaposed to the firstling as they are similar. There are things whose sanctity cannot be transferred such as the firstling of a clean animal, which cannot be sanctified for something else because it was born with the sanctity [of a firstling], and likewise, there are things born without the ability of attaining sanctity, such as an unclean animal, which is in itself unclean and cannot attain sanctity [i.e., it cannot be sanctified].
@d1“He shall redeem it based on the valuation.” [Furthermore,] this [cannot] be a donkey.@bo Because no unclean animals, except for the donkey, have a firstling law.
@p1[28]@p2<TIE>Unspecified consecrations belong to the Temple treasury.@p3 Meaning, to the Temple upkeep.
@d1To the hand of the @BIkohein@BO.@p3 Explanation: After they reach the hand of the @ITkohein@it they are completely unconsecrated in every way, and if one wants, one may buy them from the @ITkohein@it and they are like absolutely unconsecrated items.
@d1Dedications [dedicated] to the Highest may be redeemed.@p3 Explanation: Dedications to the Temple upkeep while still in his hand. The money goes to the Temple upkeep and the property becomes unconsecrated.
@d1If a vow he gives their worth.@p3 Explanation: That he said “I am obligated (to bring an offering).” He is therefore liable for responsibility [to pay if the animal] is lost, and thus the dedication obligates him [to give its full value]. He has to give money equal to its value to a @ITkohein,@it because dedicated items go to @ITkohanim,@it and the animal is sacrificed on the altar because of his prior vow.
@d1If a voluntary offering, he gives the worth of its benefit.@p3 That is, if he says, “@ITThis@it burnt-offering is dedicated.” He is thus not liable for responsibility [i.e., he is not liable to pay] if the animal got lost, and the dedication is only effective regarding the benefit he derives. That is, what another @ITkohein@it would want to give this owner in order to delay this sacrifice and not sacrifice it until his watch arrives so that he can have its skin and the other items [a @ITkohein@it can may take]. There used to be twenty-four watches. Each one took one week during which it sacrificed all the sacrifices and the watch of that each week took whatever the @ITkohanim@it had a right to. [The person who dedicated a voluntary sacrifice gives] what another @ITkohein@it would give the owner [of the sacrifice] to delay sacrificing this sacrifice until his watch arrives so that he can have the sacrifice’s skin and the other items. This is a small amount [of money] as the sacrifice might get lost and the @ITkohein@it will get nothing. Because the owner is not liable for responsibility [if it gets lost], the owner who dedicated a voluntary offering only has to give this [small] amount to a @ITkohein.@it
@d1His [Canaanite] slaves or his Canaanite maidservants.@p3 @ITGur Aryeh@it explains: Because it says @hh<HEB>מאדם@ee<ENG> (lit. @ITof@it a person), this implies only his Canaanite slaves and maidservants, but not his Hebrew slaves and maidservants.
@p1[29]@p2<TIE>If a person is going to be executed.@p3 But if his death verdict was not finalized, even if he was plagued with boils, one gives according to the rate of years. Rashi explains the verses out of order, first explaining “Everything that is dedicated is most holy,” and then going back and explaining “be it people (slave), or animal,” and then [moving forward again to verse 29 and] explaining “Any dedication that a man will dedicate.” This is because he wants to explain all the laws of dedication in order. [That is, he first explains the verse in general, “However, any dedication that a man will dedicate to Hashem from any of his belongings .<TIE>.<TIE>.  Everything that is dedicated is most holy, unto Hashem.” Afterwards, he explains the specifics of the verse, “Be it people, etc.] Because he explained “However, any dedication.<TIE>.<TIE>.,” saying that dedications to @ITkohanim@it cannot be sold to someone else or redeemed by the owner himself [who dedicated it], but must [first] be given to the @ITkohein,@it he concludes that this [dedication also] works for sacrifices that are most holy and for sacrifices of lesser degree, and he gives the money of the vow and the worth of its benefit of a voluntary offering to a @ITkohein.@it And if something is dedicated to Hheaven [the Temple], one redeems it and gives its worth to the Temple upkeep, and it is not like a dedication to @ITkohanim@it that one cannot redeem until it has reached the hand of a @ITkohein.@it This is the explanation of “Everything that is dedicated is most holy.” Afterwards, Rashi goes back and explains the laws of [specific] dedicated items and explains @hh<HEB>מאדם@ee<ENG> (lit. @ITfrom@it a man) but not every man; thus only one’s Canaanite slaves. “’Any dedication that a man will dedicate,’ If a person is going to be executed.<TIE>.<TIE>. behold, he is going to die.<TIE>.<TIE>. [and] he has no worth.”
@p1[30]@p2<TIE>Second tithe.@p3 Because here it is written is written “@ITsacred@it to Hashem,” and regarding second tithe it is written (Devarim 26:13) “I have divested my estate of @ITsacred@it material.” Thus we derive one from the other [through the common words] “sacred,” “sacred.” This excludes first tithe which is completely non-sacred as it is written (Bamidbar 18:27), “Your @ITterumah@it-gift will be considered the same as grain from the granary.”
@d1Grain.@p3 Since the verse is speaking of the second tithe, and pertaining to the second tithe it is written “grain,wine” so surely here “of the seed of the land “ [refers to] grain, wine and oil which are “of the seed of the land.”
@d1And eat in Jerusalem.@p3 Not that it actually belongs to Hashem and would therefore be forbidden to benefit from.
@p1[32]@p2<TIE>And calves.@p3 Because this mitzvah only applies to cattle and the flock as it says, “tithes of cattle and the flock.”
