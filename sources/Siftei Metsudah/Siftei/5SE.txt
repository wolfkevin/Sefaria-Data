@p1[1]@p2<TIE>Because these are words of admonishment, etc.@bo For it should have said, “And Moshe spoke to all of Israel.” Therefore, Rashi explains: Because these are words of [admonishment]. In other words, we still need to explain why it says, “In the wilderness — on the Arava Plain etc,” rather than explicitly stating their actions. Perforce, we must say that these are words of admonishment etc. And the reason why Moshe said these words in an obscure manner is because in a single speech he recounted all the times that Yisroel angered Hashem. Therefore, he did not rebuke them in a direct manner. But if he was rebuking them for only one incident in which they had angered Hashem, he would have mentioned it directly. For, “There is not a righteous man on earth who does [only] good and never sins (Koheles 7:20),” and therefore it is not so embarrassing. Also, that is why it says @hh<HEB>הדברים@it<ENG> (the words), for the term @hh<HEB>דברים@it<ENG> indicates words of rebuke. Rashi explains this at the beginning of Koheles (1:1), and there his proof is from [this verse], “These are the words.” The primary source that the term @hh<HEB>דבר@it<ENG> indicates rebuke is below (v. 17), “And the matter (@hh<HEB>דבר@it<ENG>) that will be too difficult for you, etc.” @ITRe”m@it writes: Rashi’s explanation is perplexing. For if “These are the words,” indicates words of rebuke, why does the verse say afterwards (v. 3), “with every detail that Adonoy had commanded etc.”? But, Moshe said the words of rebuke on his own. Perhaps the answer is: The words of rebuke were sanctioned by Hashem, although Moshe said them on his own. And since Hashem had allowed them, it says, “that Adonoy had commanded etc.” Alternatively: Hashem commanded Moshe to rebuke them, and it was on his own that Moshe waited until shortly before his death [to rebuke them]. But it seems to me: “With every detail that Adonoy had commanded etc,” is not referring to the rebuke, but rather to the @ITmitzvos@it in general, i.e. the review of the Torah. Moshe did two things — he rebuked them on his own, and he also explained the Torah and the @ITmitzvos@it to them@IT, @itas will he explains later. @d1And only intimated, etc.@bo You might ask: Note that afterwards, Moshe explicitly mentions their sins when discussing the spies, as it says (v. 22), “You approached me, all of you, etc.” And also other incidents in which they had angered Hashem are recounted in this parsha. The answer is: For this reason Rashi chose to say, “Moshe intended to recount here @ITall@it the @ITplaces@it.” I.e., here he recounted @ITall@it the @ITplaces@it in an obscure manner, as explained above. @d1They had angered Hashem in the wilderness, etc.@bo Onkelos also translates in a similar manner, @hh<HEB>על דחבו במדברא וכו'@it<ENG> (@ITthat they became guilty to Hashem@it in the wilderness). @ITRe”m@it writes: I find it difficult to understand how Rashi can explain that the word @hh<HEB>אלה@it<ENG> (these) is referring to the [actual] words [of rebuke] that the [rest of the] verse is alluding to. Yet, nothing is mentioned here besides the places where they angered Hashem. But the actual words [of rebuke] that Moshe said are not mentioned at all, etc. In truth, I do not know why he finds Rashi to be difficult, because note that Rashi explains @hh<HEB>אלה הדברים@it<ENG> as “these are the words of rebuke.” The word @hh<HEB>דברים@it<ENG> is the rebuke, as if the verse said, “This is the rebuke that Moshe admonished to all of Israel across the Yardein, because they sinned in the wilderness, etc.” Onkelos, however, translates the word @hh<HEB>הדברים@it<ENG> as “These are the words,” instead of, “This is the rebuke, etc.” Therefore, he needed to add the words @hh<HEB>אוכח יתהון וכו'@it<ENG> (he rebuked them, etc). But Rashi, who explains @hh<HEB>הדברים@it<ENG> as “rebuke,” has no need to add the words that Onkelos adds. Rashi’s explanation is logical and clear. @d1Because it was at Arava, etc.@bo You should not say that Arava simply means “their place of encampment,” as it is written above in Parshas Masai (Bamidbar 33:48), “And they camped in the plains of Moav (@hh<HEB>בערבות מואב@it<ENG>).” Otherwise, Scripture should have written, “Across the Yardein, in the Arava plain, in the wilderness (@hh<HEB>בערבה במדבר@it<ENG>).” @d1Regarding the denigrating statements, etc.@bo The term @hh<HEB>תפלו@it<ENG> is an expression of being “attached.” I.e., they engaged in an argument about the manna. @d1The sin they committed in the wilderness of Poron, etc.@bo Do not ask why Rashi did not explain “Poron” before “Tofel and Lovon,” in accordance with the order that they appear in the verse. For the answer is: At first, I would have thought that “Between Poron and Tofel and Lovon,” is describing the place called “Mol Suf.” But now that Rashi explains that “Tofel and Lovon” are not the names of places, then what is the meaning of “Poron”? Rashi answers: The sin they committed etc. However, [according to this explanation] the term “between” is problematic. @d1This refers to the rebellion of Korach, etc.@bo This implies that the rebellion of Korach happened before the spies were sent [as follows]: It is written, “The People traveled from Chatzeiros and they camped in the desert of Poron (Bamidbar 12:16),” and afterwards it is written, “Send for yourself men [and have them scout the land].” Since it is written here “Chatzeiros,” and Rashi explains, “This refers to the rebellion of Korach,” then we can infer that before they came to the desert of Poron, the rebellion of Korach had already taken place in Chatzeiros. See Parshas Korach [where Rashi explains differently] regarding the verse (ibid. 16:4), “And Moshe heard, etc.” @d1From what I did to Miriam, etc.@bo According to the first explanation, there is a difficulty: Scripture does not say that the rebellion of Korach happened in Chatzeiros. Therefore, Rashi says: “Another explanation, etc.” But, according to the second explanation there is a difficulty: The term, “Chatzeiros,” is not similar to the terms, “In the wilderness, on the Arava plain.” For, “In the wilderness, etc.,” refers to places where they rebelled against Hashem by angering Him, whereas “Chatzeiros” is rebuke for not having learned from Miriam, etc. But, according to the first explanation, “Chatzeiros” refers to the Jewish People angering Hashem in Chatzeiros; so it cannot be intended as rebuke for Miriam’s sin, for only the sins of the entire People are recounted here. For this reason, the first explanation is also necessary. @d1And nevertheless you spoke against the Almighty.@bo “You spoke, etc,” refers to, “For it [the Nation of Canaan] is more powerful than us (Bamidbar 13:31),” as Rashi explains there. Alternatively: They spoke against the Almighty Who praised the Land, yet they denigrated it. Even though the rebuke regarding the spies was already learned from, “between Poron,” nevertheless, sending the spies was one matter, and their slander against the Land is a separate matter. We could also explain that “you spoke against the Almighty,” is referring to the rebellion of Korach. There is no [practical] difference between Rashi’s first and second explanation; only that the second one says that Hashem rebuked them for not learning from [the incident of] Miriam who was smitten for speaking against her brother, and the first explanation says that Hashem rebuked them for angering the Almighty with the rebellion [of Korach] (@ITRe”m@it). @p1[2]@p2<TIE>Deduct from these days the thirty days, etc.@bo I.e., in total deduct thirty-six days [instead of thirty-seven] because the thirtieth day is counted as the end of the thirty day period and also as the beginning of the seven days. For on the thirtieth day they traveled from Kivros haTaavah; so it turns out that on the thirty-ninth day they sent the spies from Kodeish-Barnei’a, which is the twenty-ninth day of Sivan (see @ITRe”m@it who elaborates at length). @d1The @BIShechina@BO attempted for your good to hasten, etc.@bo The term @hh<HEB>מתלבטת@it<ENG> means to hasten.<QC>
@d1Circle around Mount Seir for forty years.@bo This is not an explanation of the verse, “In the fortieth year.” I.e., Rashi is not explaining the verse as: “Eleven days from Choreiv by way of Mount Seir,” but they traveled it in forty years, as it says, “In the fortieth year.” Rather, “In the fortieth year,” refers to what is written afterwards, as Rashi explains, “This teaches that he did admonish them [only shortly before his death], etc.” The first verse is abridged, and it is as if it is written, “Eleven days from Choreiv, but you traveled it in three days with the Almighty’s help. However, because of your misconduct, you were delayed for forty years.” And afterwards starts a new sentence, “In the fortieth year .<TIE>.<TIE>. Moshe addressed Bnei Yisrael, etc.” One should not ask: Here it implies that the sin of the spies is the reason they were delayed in the wilderness for forty years, yet in Parshas Beha’aloscha (Bamidbar 10:29) Rashi explains, “Immediately within three days we will enter the land .<TIE>.<TIE>.but they sinned with the complainers [for meat].” The answer is: Because of their complaining they were delayed for thirty days, and on account of the sin of the spies they were delayed forty years. @p1[3]@p2<TIE>Only shortly before his death, etc.@bo Otherwise, why does matter when he admonished them?<QC>
@d1So that he does not admonish him again and again, etc.@bo In other words, if he admonishes [sometime before] his death, he would consider, “I will admonish them some today, and some tomorrow. For why should I admonish them all at once while I still have time tomorrow to admonish them?” But perhaps the other person might think he is being constantly admonished out of hatred, and therefore he will despise the admonishment. For this reason one should admonish shortly before his own death for all misconduct. You might ask: If so, why does Rashi explain above: “From whom did he learn this? From Yaakov, etc.” How does Rashi know this? Perhaps Moshe thought on his own to do so, as there are four reasons why one would not admonish, etc. The answer is: We know that none of these four reasons apply here. For we cannot say that they would leave Moshe, for where would they go? They only left Egypt in order to enter the Land of Israel. Also we cannot say that [the reason not to admonish them is] so they should not be ashamed of him, since he is admonishing the entire Jewish People together. And Rashi’s statement, “Why did I not admonish you, etc,” is only an explanation for Yaakov. You might ask: It is written, “You shall surely rebuke (Vayikra 19:17),” and Rashi explains, “Even a hundred times.” The answer is: “You shall surely rebuke” applies at the time of the offense. And “So that he does not admonish him again and again,” applies after the offense has been done. @d1So that his fellow not be ashamed, etc.@bo I.e., when the person who gave the admonishment sees him, the one who was admonished would be ashamed.<QC>
@p1[4]@p2<TIE>If I admonish them, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Why does Scripture need to write, “After he had smitten, etc,” since it is previously written, “In the fortieth year, etc.” Rather, this is what Moshe said, etc. You might ask: If so, perhaps the (only) reason Moshe did not admonish them earlier was because he waited, etc., so they do not say, “What good has he done for us?” The answer is: If so, the verse should have said, “And it was after he had smitten Sichon and Og.” Why does is it written, “In the fortieth year”? Rather, it must be to teach us that one should not admonish until shortly before the admonisher’s death. And since it is written, “After he had smitten, etc.,” we can also learn that Moshe said, etc. @d1To find an excuse, etc.@bo The term @hh<HEB>עילה@it<ENG> is the same as @hh<HEB>עלילה@it<ENG> (lit. false accusation). @d1Even if Sichon was not a formidable opponent, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Why is it necessary for Scripture to write, “who was living in Cheshbon”? Why mention where they were? @d1Similar to Ashteros Karnayim, etc.@bo The word “Karnayim” is from the term @hh<HEB>קרן@it<ENG> (horn), which denotes strength. @d1And this Ashtoros is indeed the same Ashteros Karnayim, etc.@bo I.e., do not ask: How does Rashi know that the term “Ashtoros” denotes cliffs? Perhaps it is specifically the term “Ashteros Karnayim” that denotes cliffs. Therefore, Rashi explains: And this Ashtoros is indeed the same Ashteros Karnayim, etc. There also it is written, “the one who escaped came, etc” which refers to Og. @d1This was the name of the empire.@bo Rashi is answering the question: If he was living in Ashtoros, then he is not living in Edrei. Therefore, Rashi explains: The name of the empire was Edrei. @ITRe”m@it says: (If this is not so, then) the verse should say @hh<HEB>ובאדרעי@it<ENG> (@ITand@it in Edrei). @p1[5]@p2<TIE>[The word @HB<HEB>הואיל@BO<ENG> means] he began, etc.@bo See Rashi’s commentary in Parshas Vayeira (Bereishis 18:31). @d1In seventy languages, etc.@bo Since it is written here @hh<HEB>באר@it<ENG> (elucidate) the Torah, and in Parshas Ki Savo (27:8) it is written “You are to write [on the stones all the statements of this Torah] @hh<HEB>באר היטב@it<ENG> (elucidated well). The numerical value of the word @hh<HEB>היטב@it<ENG> is seventy, when calculated as follows: @hh<HEB>ה"@it<ENG>=5, @hh<HEB>ה"י@it<ENG>=15, @hh<HEB>הי"ט@it<ENG>=24, @hh<HEB>היט"ב@it<ENG>=26; the numbers 5, 15, 24, and 26 add up to 70. [The word @hh<HEB>באר@it<ENG> written here should also be understood as @hh<HEB>באר היטב@it<ENG>]. @p1[6]@p2<TIE>According to its plain meaning.@bo I.e., the word @hh<HEB>רב@it<ENG> means “an extended time period.” @d1But there is an Aggadic interpretation, etc.@bo For according to its plain meaning, there is a difficulty: The verse should have said “@hh<HEB>די לכם שבת@it<ENG> (@ITEnough@it of your living).” Why does it use the term @hh<HEB>רב@it<ENG> (lit. a lot)? Therefore, Rashi explains: But there is an Aggadic interpretation. @p1[7]@p2<TIE>This refers to Ammon, and Moav, etc.@bo Some commentators question: Note that it is written (below 2:9), “Do not intimidate them [Moav] with war [for I will not give you any of his land] etc.” Perhaps the answer is: If the Jewish People had not sinned, Hashem would have given them the land of the ten Canaanite nations, as He promised Avrohom. However, because they sinned, Hashem only gave them the land of seven nations. @d1It is referred to as great, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Is not the Euphrates River the smallest of them all, for in Parshas Bereishis (2:14), it is mentioned last? Rashi explains this in Parshas Lech Lecha (Bereishis 15:18). @d1Attach yourself to the chief, etc.@bo The word @hh<HEB>שחוור@hh@ee<ENG> means “chief.” @d1Become close to one who is anointed and you too will become anointed.@bo I.e., become close to one who is anointed with oil, and you will also become anointed through your contact with him. The phrase (Yeshayah 34:6) @hh<HEB>הודשנה מחלב@it<ENG> (it @ITbecame anointed @itfrom the fats) is rendered in the Targum as @hh<HEB>איתדהינא@it<ENG> [which is related to the word @hh<HEB>דהינא@it<ENG> quoted by Rashi here]. Rashi means to say: Here too, since the Land of Israel is distinguished, so too the Euphrates River has become important along with it. @p1[8]@p2<TIE>No one will contest this matter, etc.@bo Otherwise, how could he say to them “Come,” for the Land had not yet been conquered?! @p1[9]@p2<TIE>What is the significance of @HB<HEB>לאמר@BO<ENG>, etc.@bo I.e., the word @hh<HEB>לאמר@it<ENG> (to say) is always intended to be expounded, meaning either, “to say to others,” or, “go say to them My words and bring Me a response,” or, “respond to My words.” But, none of these meanings apply here. Therefore, Rashi asks: What is the significance of @hh<HEB>לאמר@it<ENG> in this context? @d1I am not telling you this on my own initiative, etc.@bo In other words, [Moshe was saying,] “Even if I had wanted to carry you by myself in order to receive reward, I would not be able to because the Almighty has prevented me.” This is the meaning of @hh<HEB>לאמר@it<ENG> (saying) — that the Almighty told me explicitly not to do so. Rashi explains likewise below (v. 12): “If I would say, ‘I will do so in order to be rewarded,’ I cannot do so.” This is what I have [already] told you, etc., referring to the explanation given here. @d1Is it possible that Moshe was unable, etc.@bo You might ask: Did Rashi not explain above, “I am not telling you this on my own, etc.”? If so, what is Rashi’s question? Perhaps Moshe was capable, but he was not permitted. The answer is: Rashi’s question is based on the (seemingly) extra words. Why does Moshe say, “I cannot [carry you] by myself .<TIE>.<TIE>. Adonoy, your God, has multiplied you etc.”? Rather, Moshe was saying: “I am not telling you this on my own .<TIE>.<TIE>. And even if the Almighty did not command me, I still would have needed to appoint judges over you, for I cannot carry you by myself, etc.” That is why Rashi asks: It is possible that, etc. @d1Was unable to judge them?@it@bo Some [commentators] ask: Yisro said to Moshe, “You are going to wear yourself out (Shemos 18:18).” Rashi should have asked [there]: Regarding a prophet like Moshe, how could Yisro think it was difficult for him to judge the People? The answer is that above, I could think that Yisro was saying the following: “You are going to wear out this people.” I.e., it was difficult for the people that Moshe sat alone to judge them, for they all stood waiting for him from morning until evening. Certainly if there were many judges, it would be easier upon the people. Therefore, since it was difficult for the People then they would complain to Moshe, and this would be difficult for him. Therefore, Rashi explains [only] here. @d1Multiplied you — i.e., has made you great and has uplifted you.@bo I.e., the term @hh<HEB>הרבה@it<ENG> means, “He has made you great.” @d1And set it upon the judges.@bo This refers to when the judges have the power to prevent wrongdoing, and they fail to do so. @d1He is the wisest of all men, etc.@bo One should not ask: The verse, “For who is able to judge,” was stated before, “He is the wisest of all men.” And if so, then when Shlomo said, “For who is able to judge?” he was not yet wise! The answer is: His end is testimony to his beginning. I.e., since Shlomo became so wise — to the greatest extent possible — then in the beginning he also must have been wise and capable of judging the People, as it says (Mishlei 14:33), “In an understanding heart, wisdom rests.”<QC>
@p1[10]@p2<TIE>What then does “you are today” mean? You are compared to the day.@bo I.e., the term @hh<HEB>כיום@it<ENG> [in Rashi] is the same as @hh<HEB>כהיום@it<ENG> (like the day). @d1As the sun, the moon, and the stars.@bo Meaning, “like the day.” Although the moon and stars do not reign during the day, it is not called a “day” without including the night with it, as it is written (Bereishis 1:5), “And it was evening, and it was morning, [it was] day one.” If so, it is fine that the verse says [according to Rashi’s explanation] “like the day” [and then mentions the stars]. (In the name of @ITMaharitz@it). The phrase @hh<HEB>לרוב@it<ENG> (as numerous) means: @ITIn the future@it, you will also be as numerous as the stars. Now, however, you are eternal like them (the sun, moon and the stars), but you are not as numerous as them (@ITRe”m@it).<QC>
@p1[11]@p2<TIE>Moshe then said to them, “This is my personal blessing etc.”@bo I.e., the one thousand fold is my personal blessing, but Hashem will bless you more than one thousand fold as He spoke about you. You might ask: Since Hashem promised to bless them to be as numerous as the dust of the earth, why does Moshe say, “The one thousand fold is my personal blessing”? Is that not included in Hashem’s blessing? The answer is: Moshe’s statement, “This [one thousand fold] is my personal blessing,” refers to reward [in this world] from the blessings. Another explanation is: “This is from me,” means that these blessings from me are unconditional. However, the blessings from Hashem are on the condition that you uphold the @ITmitzvos@it and the Torah. @p1[12]@p2<TIE>In order to be rewarded, I cannot do so, etc.@bo In other words: “Even if I would want to carry you alone in order to be rewarded, I cannot do so.” Otherwise, why did he say, “How can I carry alone”? For Moshe had already said (v. 9), “I cannot carry you by myself, etc.” which is due to the penalty, etc.<QC>
@d1This teaches that they were scoffers, etc.@bo The word @hh<HEB>אפיקורסין@it<ENG> means (literally) “rebels.” It is a contraction of two words: @hh<HEB>אפיק@it<ENG> (discard), and @hh<HEB>רסן@it<ENG> (bridle). I.e., the bridle is thrown off them — they go about unbridled. Therefore, they are rebellious, just as a horse that is unbridled. @p1[13]@p2<TIE>Prepare yourselves to fulfill this matter.@bo The word @hh<HEB>הבה@it<ENG> always denotes preparation for a matter, meaning, to give advice or assistance for a particular matter (@ITRe”m@it). @d1Righteous men.@bo Why did Rashi not explain this above regarding, “Send for yourself @ITmen@it, etc. (Bamidbar 13:2)”? The answer is: This explanation applies here more than it does there. For the Mishnah says (Nidah 6:4), “All who are fit to testify, are fit to judge.” And since women are not fit to testify, they are not fit to judge. Therefore, why does the verse need to specify “men”? @d1Men who are desired.@bo The word @hh<HEB>כסופים@it<ENG> is an expression of @hh<HEB>חמוד@it<ENG> (desirable), i.e., the people desire them, for they speak clearly and they do not speak longer than necessary. Another explanation is: The word @hh<HEB>כסופים@it<ENG> is an expression of @hh<HEB>בושה@it<ENG> (shame). I.e., they are ashamed of their wrongdoings. And when they desire to do an action, they consider the outcome [of their actions] beforehand, in order not to be ashamed from it. And such a person is called a @hh<HEB>חכם@it<ENG> (wise person), as the verse says, “The wise look [ahead] from the beginning (Koheles 2:14).” This is also stated in Pirkei Avos (2:13), “Do not consider yourself to be wicked in your own eyes.” @d1He goes about to bring his own.@bo I.e., he buys and sells merchandise. @d1Enwrapped in his @BItalis@BO, etc.@bo This is the custom of judges. @d1The word @HB<HEB>אשמם@BO<ENG> lacks the letter @BIyud@BO, etc.@bo The word @hh<HEB>אשמם@it<ENG> is an expression of @hh<HEB>אשמה@it<ENG> (guilt). Although it should have said, “@ITYour@it guilt (@hh<HEB>ואשמכם@it<ENG>) is placed upon your heads,” since this whole section is in the second person, nevertheless, we do not question an exegesis (@ITRe”m@it). The reason why Rashi reverses the order and explains @hh<HEB>בראשיכם@it<ENG> (leaders over you) before @hh<HEB>ואשמם@it<ENG> (and designated them) is because: According to the manner in which the verse is written, it implies the opposite of Rashi’s explanation, that the guilt of the judges is placed on your heads — referring to the people’s heads. Otherwise, the verse should have said @hh<HEB>ואשמם בראשם@it<ENG> (and their guilt is placed upon @ITtheir@it heads). Therefore, Rashi first had to explain the word @hh<HEB>בראשיכם@it<ENG> “that you will conduct yourselves with them with respect.” Then afterwards he explains the word @hh<HEB>ואשמם@it<ENG>. It is as if Rashi is saying, “and now this verse is understandable.” @p1[14]@p2<TIE>You answered with determination, etc.@bo Rash is answering the question: Everything that Moshe is saying to the Jewish People has been words of rebuke. Why then does Moshe say to them: You replied to me and said, “[It is a] good thing that you said to do, etc.” On the contrary, he is praising them for doing as he had commanded them. Therefore, Rashi explains: You answered with determination, etc. In other words, you did this for your own benefit. The word @hh<HEB>חלטתם@it<ENG> is an expression of [answering with] determination.” @d1Who suffered for it?@it@bo The word “it” refers to the Torah.<QC>
@p1[15]@p2<TIE>I persuaded them with words.@bo Whenever the word “take” does not refer to a specific type of acquisition, it means, “persuading with words.” This has already been explained in many other places. @d1This qualification was one of the seven requirements, etc.@bo Four of them are written here: Men — which implies righteous, wise, understanding, and renowned. And another three are written in Parshas Yisro (Shemos 18:21): God-fearing, men of truth, who despise gain. Moshe found only three of them: Righteous, wise, and renowned. Even though the four written here are not written in Parshas Yisro, nevertheless we must say that Yisro also told them to Moshe. Otherwise, why would Moshe disregard what Yisro had told him? @ITRe”m@it counts four qualifications in Parshas Yisro: Capable, God-fearing, men of truth, who despise gain. And he counts three here: Wise, understanding, and renowned. According to this, we must say that @ITRe”m@it does not count “righteous,” for it is the same as “God-fearing” which is written in Parshas Yisro. @d1He is to enter [the Synagogue or Bais Hamidrash] last and he is to be first to leave.@bo So that everyone will stand up for them, which is a great show of respect. Also, they should leave first [from the Bais Hamidrash] before anyone else, so that everyone will need to stand up for them (@ITRe”m@it). Some commentators explain the opposite: He is to enter last from the Synagogue or Bais Hamidrash to his home, and this was Moshe’s humility, so that the people will not have to stand up for him. And he is to be first to leave his home to the Synagogue or Bais Hamidrash; and arrive there before anyone else so that they should not have to stand up for him. @d1I appointed court-officers for your tribes.@bo Rashi chose the word @hh<HEB>מניתי@it<ENG> (I appointed) here, but not earlier (in the verse). In doing so, he is answering the question: The verse, “And designated them leaders over you: masters of thousands, etc .<TIE>.<TIE>. and court-officers for your tribes,” implies that the “leaders (of thousands, etc.)” are also court-officers. Therefore, Rashi explains: “I appointed court-officers for your tribes,” but the leaders were not court-officers. Rashi continues and explains how he knows this: “For the court-officers are the ones who jail, etc.” meaning, “by order of the judges,” i.e., “by order of the leaders.” This teaches us that the court-officers were not the leaders. @p1[16]@p2<TIE>Act with patience in judging, etc.@bo It is written, “I commanded your judges,” but there has not been any previous mention of judges! It should say, “leaders.” Rather, “judges,” is intended for an exegesis. The verse should be interpreted as, “I commanded you regarding matters of judgment to act with patience.” However, @ITRe”m@it explains that this is derived from, “between your brothers.” It would have been sufficient to say, “And you are to judge right between a man and his complainant.” Rather, “between your brothers,” is intended to teach us to act with patience in judging — to listen between your brothers and understand their statements well, so that if certain litigation is brought before you, etc. @d1In the past you were on your own, etc.@bo It was your choice whether to learn and probe the depths of @IThalacha@it or to sit idly, which is no longer the case. @d1Who accumulates words against him, etc.@bo The word @hh<HEB>גרו@it<ENG> is missing an @ITalef@it, as if it said @hh<HEB>אוגרו@it<ENG> (accumulates). Similarly, the phrase (v. 17) @hh<HEB>לא תגורו@it<ENG> is like @hh<HEB>לא תאגרו@it<ENG>. We should not say, as it apparently seems, that the term @hh<HEB>גרו@it<ENG> is like the phrase (Vayikra 24:16) @hh<HEB>כגר כאזרח@it<ENG> (as a @ITresident@it or citizen). For if so, why is the letter @ITvav@it of @hh<HEB>גרו@it<ENG> necessary? However, there is a difficulty with this explanation, for then @hh<HEB>גרו@it<ENG> is missing an @ITaleph@it. Therefore, Rashi says: Another explanation — between his co-dweller, etc. According to this, @hh<HEB>גרו@it<ENG> means “dwelling,” as in the verse (Bereishis 26:3), “Dwell (@hh<HEB>גור@it<ENG>) in this land.” But, with the second explanation alone, there is also a difficulty: The verse should explicitly say @hh<HEB>כירו@it<ENG> (his range). Therefore, both explanations are needed. @d1Even [a dispute] about an oven and a range.@bo Because it is written @hh<HEB>גרו@it<ENG>, and the letters @ITgimmel@it and @ITkaf@it are interchangeable, as Rashi explains in Parshas Kedoshim (Vayikra 19:16), therefore, @hh<HEB>גרו@it<ENG> is the same as @hh<HEB>כירו@it<ENG> (his range). And since it is written @hh<HEB>ובין גרו@it<ENG>, perforce it means: And between the division [of a house] between brothers, [even a dispute] about an oven and a range. For it is impossible that the division is between a range and a house.<QC>
@p1[17]@p2<TIE>This [command is addressed] to the one who appoints judges, etc.@bo For it is already written [to the judges], “And you are to judge right.” But in Parshas Shoftim (below 16:19) regarding, “Do not display favoritism,” Rashi explains: Even at the time of litigation — this is a warning @ITto the judge@it not to be gentle to one litigant and harsh to the other, etc. The answer is: It cannot be explained there the same as here. Otherwise, the verses should be reversed and say, “Do not show favor in judgment” before, “Do not bend justice,” [as will now be explained:] the previous verse was dealing with appointing judges. For it is written, “And they will judge the people justly,” and Rashi explains, “Appoint judges who are expert and righteous.” And since, “Do not show favor in judgment,” is written after, “Do not bend justice,” (which is referring to the judges), then it too must be referring to the judges. Rashi does not explain here as he does over there, because here the verse says, “And you are to judge right between a man and his brother.” If he should be gentle to one litigant and harsh to the other, it would not be judging rightly. Therefore, “Do not show favor in judgment,” is unnecessary. Rather, it must be referring to the one who appoints judges. @d1[Litigation involving a @BIperuta@BO] should be as dear to you, etc.@bo It seems that the word @hh<HEB>כתרגומו@it<ENG> is printed in the wrong place, and should read: “Small and great alike will you hear out,” can be explained as @ITTargum Onkelos@it has [adding the word @hh<HEB>מילי@it<ENG> (matter)]: Litigation involving a @ITperuta@it should be as dear to you, etc. Rashi’s [first] explanation is Talmudic (Sanhedrin 8a), and the last two are from @ITSifrei@it (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it).<QC>
@d1So if a [minor litigation] comes before you first, etc.@bo For if you [incorrectly] think to interpret this verse literally as, “Whether the @ITdefendant@it is an average person or whether he is a figure of authority,” this can be learned from the phrase, “Between a man and his brother.” (@ITRe”m@it). @d1Another explanation: Small and great alike will you hear out, etc.@bo The first explanation is problematic, for the verse should say @hh<HEB>כמעט כהרבה@it<ENG> (a little or a lot). Therefore, Rashi says: Another explanation.<TIE>.<TIE>. [This one is a poor man, etc.] And the second explanation is [also] problematic, for the verse should say @hh<HEB>גדול כקטן@it<ENG> (the great like the small). I.e., you should rule in favor of the rich man if he is innocent, just as you would try to rule in favor of the poor man to support him in a tidy manner. Therefore, Rashi says: Another explanation: He should not say, [“How can I offend] etc.” Yet, this last explanation is [also] problematic, for the verse should say @hh<HEB>קטן כגדול@it<ENG> (the small like the great) will you hear out. And with only the last two explanations there is [also] a problem, for the verse should say @hh<HEB>כעני כעשיר@it<ENG> (wealthy and poor alike). Therefore, the first explanation is also needed. @d1Do not be afraid.@bo I.e., a judge should not say, “I am afraid of this man, for perhaps he will kill me or he will set fire to my stockpile of grain.”<QC>
@d1Do not gather in [suppress] your words, etc.@bo For example, a disciple who is in the presence of his rabbi, and a judgment is presented to his rabbi and he judges incorrectly, the disciple should not remain silent. Rashi’s first explanation is problematic, for the verse should have said @hh<HEB>אל תיראו@it<ENG> (do not be afraid). Therefore, Rashi says: Another explanation, Do not gather in, etc. But, the second explanation is problematic, for the verse should have said @hh<HEB>לא תאגורו@it<ENG> (do not gather in) [with an @ITaleph@it], an expression similar to @hh<HEB>אוגר בקיץ@it<ENG> (gathering in the summer) (Mishlei 10:5). Therefore, the first reason is also needed. @ITRe”m@it explains: Do not keep your words [hidden] in your heart out of fear to speak them out and tell the litigant that he is liable or guilty in his dispute. @d1That you diverted the judgment upon Me.@bo Otherwise, what is the meaning of, “Justice belongs to Hashem”? Justice pertains only to the litigants! @d1Because of this [statement] the law eluded him, etc.@bo Because Moshe likened himself to Hashem: For it is written, “For justice belongs to Hashem,” and afterwards it is written, “And the matter that will be too difficult for you, present to me,” as if Moshe himself were Hashem. Therefore, the laws pertaining to inheritance which are a simple matter eluded him. For everyone knows that if a man has no sons, then a daughter inherits instead of a son. For Rachel and Leah said (Bereishis 31:14), “Do we have a portion anymore, etc,” meaning: We do not share the inheritance along with the males. Yet, this eluded Moshe. Rashi did not explain that because of this statement the law regarding the woodchopper, or regarding the ritually impure eluded him — for those are not simple [laws], and therefore Moshe did not know. But the laws regarding inheritance are simple. @p1[18]@p2<TIE>Between monetary litigations, etc.@bo The fourth chapter of Sanhedrin (32a) explains regarding monetary litigation: 1. Three judges are required. 2. The judges may begin even with a guilty charge. 3. A guilty decision may be reached by a majority of only one. 4. A judge may change his verdict and render even a guilty decision. 5. Anyone may partake to acquit or to find guilty, whether a judge or a disciple. 6. A judge who was going to acquit can retract and decide guilty, and vice-verse. 7. Proceedings begin during the day and may be completed at night. 8. A decision to acquit or to find guilty may be reached on the same day. 9. The proceedings are begun by the senior judge. 10. [Ibid. 36a] A father and his son, or a rabbi and his disciple, may be considered as two judges. Capital litigation, however, requires twenty-three judges. Furthermore, everything else written above does not apply to capital litigation. To the contrary, whatever is allowed in monetary litigation is disqualified in capital litigation.<QC>
@p1[19]@p2<TIE>In there were snakes thick as beams, etc.@bo Otherwise, what is the meaning of “awesome”? In that wilderness, from whom would they fear? For no person traveled there! Rather, it refers to snakes, etc. You might ask: In Parshas Beha’aloscha (Bamidbar 10:34), Rashi explains, “A cloud traveled in front of them and killed the snakes and scorpions.” The answer is: Wherever they camped in the wilderness, the snakes surrounded their camp. When they left the camp to relieve themselves, they saw the dead snakes, and they were in awe, even though the snakes did not harm them.<QC>
@p1[22]@p2<TIE>In a hodgepodge, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: What is the rebuke in this statement? @d1What language they speak.@bo Otherwise, why is “word” needed? The purpose of knowing which language they speak is in order to detect if one of the seven nations dressed up like another nation. Then the Jewish People would recognize the hoax and be able to uphold the commandment, “Do not leave anyone alive (below 20:16).” This is not possible unless they knew which language they spoke so then they knew from which nation they are. Also, there are other explanations given on this matter. @d1There is no road in which there are no winding curves.@bo Otherwise, for what purpose did they ask the spies which road to go upon? Certainly, whichever city they wished to conquer they would go up on that particular road. @d1[Which cities] will we have to capture first.@bo Rashi is answering the question: The phrase, “And the cities,” implies that they will not go to every city. Yet this is not true, for they will inherit the entire land. For this reason Rashi explains: “Which cities.<TIE>.<TIE>. @ITfirst@it.” @p1[23]@p2<TIE>From the choicest among you.@bo Otherwise, why is “from you,” needed? @d1From the finest among you.@bo The word @hh<HEB>המסולתין@it<ENG> is from the word @hh<HEB>סולת@it<ENG> (fine flour) [Figuratively meaning, “the finest”]. @d1This tells us that the tribe of Levi was not among them.@bo Otherwise, there should be thirteen men, as the tribes of Ephraim and Menasha are counted separately.<FJ> @ITRe”m@it writes: This explanation is perplexing, since without the verse [specifying], “twelve men,” we would know this. For in Parshas Shlach Lecha (Bamidbar Ch. 13), all the tribal leaders are enumerated, and the tribe of Levi is not included with them. @ITRe”m@it leaves this question unresolved. It seems to me that the verse [specifying], “twelve men,” is teaching us that the tribe of Levi did not even participate [in devising the plan of the spies]. According to this, it fits well that Rashi does not say, “The tribe of Levi did not @ITgo@it with them,” for this was already written above in Parshas Shlach Lecha. @p1[24]@p2<TIE>This tells us that it was called [Eshkol] because of the incident that was to happen there.@bo For they carried a cluster (Eshkol) of grapes from there, as it is written (Bamidbar 13:23), “And they cut off a branch, etc,” and [the following verse says explicitly that] “it was called Wadi Eshkol [because of the report about the cluster of grapes].” But this first occurred when the spies were returning. @d1Along four lines etc.@bo Rashi means to say that they walked through the land in four lines — through its length and breadth, in order to spy out the entire land.<QC>
@p1[25]@p2<TIE>Who were they that said [the land was] good, etc.@bo Although the other spies also said that it was good, nevertheless they also brought a bad report about the land. And here it is written, “They said, ‘Good is the land’,” which implies that they did not say anything bad about it (@ITRe”m@it). @p1[27]@p2<TIE>A popular proverb says, etc.@bo Rashi intends to say that you should not ask how did the Israelites know that Hashem hated them. And therefore Rashi explains: Since they hated Hashem, they said that He also hated them, as a popular proverb says, etc. @d1What is in your heart regarding your friend, etc.@bo I.e., whatever is in your heart — that you [subconsciously] hate your friend, you say about him — that he hates you. @d1 [You imagine] is in his heart regarding yourself.@bo I.e., whatever is in your friend’s heart — that he loves you, you say about yourself — that you love him. @d1His taking us out was an act of hatred, etc.@bo Rashi answers the question: From the verse it seems that Hashem took them out of Egypt because He hated them. But, He performed many miracles for them in order to take them out to freedom. Therefore Rashi explains that they said, “His taking us out [in itself] was an act of hatred, etc.”<QC>
@d1One of which was well-watered, and the other was dry, etc.@bo @ITRe”m@it writes: This is perplexing. Why does Rashi explain this verse as referring to a dry and a watered field? If it is to demonstrate that Hashem took the Jewish People out of Egypt because He hated them, the fact that He took them out to lead them into the hand of the Emorite and destroy them. is a greater proof of hatred. @ITRe”m@it leaves this question unresolved. But it seems (to me) that Rashi is answering the following question: The verse should have said, “Because of Adonoy’s hatred of us, He took us out [in order] to deliver us into the hand of the Emorite.” Why is, “of the land of Egypt” needed? Rather, “He took us out of the land of Egypt,” must be to make the comparison to the dry field and watered field. And the verse should be understood as: “@ITFor one@it, because of Adonoy’s hatred of us etc.,” — this is for the comparison to the dry field and watered field. “@ITAnd furthermore@it, in order to put us, etc.” The word @hh<HEB>בעל@it<ENG> means a dry and arid land that requires irrigation. @p1[28]@p2<TIE>Exaggerated terms.@bo Rashi explains in the chapter [entitled], “The Sciatic Nerve,” (Maseches Chulin 90b): “@hh<HEB>לשון הבאי@it<ENG> means, ‘a common person’s manner of speech.’ He is not precise with his words, and says things that are not true. He does not lie intentionally; he is just not precise [in what he says].” @p1[31]@p2<TIE>This verse is connected to the [previous] verse, etc.@bo For the verse could be understood as: “He will wage war for you as in everything that He did.<TIE>.<TIE>. and in the wilderness, etc.” Meaning, that even in the wilderness Hashem waged war on their behalf. But, He did not wage war in the wilderness! Therefore, Rashi explains: This verse is connected to the previous verse, “As in everything that He did with you in Egypt.” I.e., that He bestowed good upon you, and also in the wilderness He bestowed good upon them — for He carried them the way a man carries his son, etc. The word @hh<HEB>עשה@it<ENG> (He did) is being used in two different ways. The first one refers to the waging of war, and the second refers to Hashem’s love (for the Jewish People).<QC>
@p1[33]@p2<TIE>The word @HB<HEB>לראתכם@BO<ENG> is the same as @HB<HEB>להראתכם@BO<ENG>, etc.@bo The @ITpasach@it vowel under the @hh<HEB>ל@it<ENG> is a substitute for the missing @hh<HEB>ה@it<ENG>.<QC>
@p1[36]@p2<TIE>This refers to Chevron, etc.@bo Rashi is explaining: Is the entire Land going to be given to Koleiv! @p1[41]@p2<TIE>As if to say, you made yourselves ready.@bo Rashi has a difficulty with this verse: How is it plausible to use the word @hh<HEB>הן@it<ENG> (“yes,” or, “here we are”) here? Certainly when a man tells his friend to do something for him, then a response of “yes “ or “here we are” is plausible. But here, Hashem and Moshe warned them not to go up [the mountain]. If so, a response of, “yes” is not plausible! Therefore, Rashi explains: “As if to say, you made yourselves ready.” You made yourselves ready to do this, as if you had explicitly said, “Here we are.” @p1[42]@p2<TIE>There will be no going up [victory] for you etc@it@bo. Since it is written, “Do not go up,” why then does it need to say, “Do not wage war”? It is obvious that if they do not go up, then there will be no war. Rather, the verse must certainly mean: “Do not go up, for you will not be able to wage war against them.” And if so, going up [the mountain] will be your downfall. But @ITRe”m@it explains: Since it is written, “So that you will not be shattered,” we can infer that the statement, “Do not go up,” is intended for their benefit. If so, it is not a warning. Rather, it is informing them that their course of action will not be victorious, etc. @p1[44]@p2<TIE>When it stings a person, it dies immediately, etc.@bo I.e., the bee dies immediately. The word @hh<HEB>תעשינה@it<ENG> is related to the word @hh<HEB>עשייה@it<ENG> (do). We should not say that the verse means: A @ITgreat number@it of Emorites will chase you, in the same manner that a great number of bees chase after a person. If so, the verse only should have said, “And chased you like bees.” Now that it is written, “As the bees @ITdo@it,” then it is comparing them only to the way that bees act, etc. @p1[45]@p2<TIE>You made His attribute of compassion, etc.@bo For otherwise, the name Adonoy denotes compassion — so why then is it mentioned regarding punishment? (@ITDevek Tov@it).<QC>
@p1[46]@p2<TIE>Which totaled thirty-eight years, etc.@bo The spies were sent during the second year after leaving Egypt; and in the beginning of the fortieth year they came to the Land, for a partial year is counted as an entire year. If so, they traveled for only thirty-eight years. @p1[1]@p2<TIE>Had they not sinned, etc.@bo Meaning: Due to their sin, Hashem did not manipulate the King of Edom’s heart to allow them to pass through his land. @d1The route they traveled when leaving Egypt, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: “By way of the Reed Sea,” implies that they traveled from north to south, along the Reed Sea. Yet, they traveled from west to east in the wilderness! For this reason, Rashi explains: “The route they traveled when leaving Egypt,” i.e., when they left Egypt, they traveled diagonally towards the Reed Sea from west to east. Now, also, they traveled in the same direction, for they abandoned traveling the shorter route from south to north. Instead they traveled along the southern border of Edom, from west to east, until they came to the border of Moav. @d1[We traversed] its entire southern rim.@bo One should not say that they circled Mount Seir on all four sides, and this is not possible. For otherwise Moshe would have entered the Land of Israel, because the land of Edom is on the border of the Land of Israel, as explained in the demarcation of the Land’s borders (Bamidbar 34:3). Therefore, Rashi explains: Only its entire southern rim, until the land of Moav (@ITMaharan@it). @p1[3]@p2<TIE>Turn yourselves towards the eastern side, etc.@bo This command was given when they were at the end of the southern border of Edom. If so, it contradicts Rashi’s explanation in Parshas Masai (Bamidbar 34:3), that they first turned northward after they had traversed the southern border of Moav. [The answer is:] Nevertheless, Moshe had [first] requested from the king of Edom to travel northward through his land, but he refused. [And therefore] @ITafterwards@it they needed to traverse the entire southern border of Moav, and then they turned northward (@ITRe”m@it). But it seems to me as follows: The original intention of, “Turn yourself northward,” was to turn northward after coming to the end of Moav’s border. This is explained in the verses following. And when they came to the border of Edom it says, “Do not incite them (v. 5).” And when they came to the border of Moav and they wanted to pass through their border on the north, Hashem said to them, “Do not besiege Moav (v. 9).” Therefore, it was inevitable that they would have to traverse the entire border of Moav until its eastern side [and then turn northward]. @p1[5]@p2<TIE>Even as much as a footstep, etc.@bo The word @hh<HEB>עד@it<ENG> means, “Up until — and including.” It is as if Hashem said to them, “I will not permit you to have any control over their land, even as much as a footstep, to just pass through, without their permission. A similar use [of the term @hh<HEB>עד@it<ENG>] is found in the verse (Shemos 14:28) @hh<HEB>עד אחד@it<ENG> (@ITNot@it one of them). @d1To pass through their land, unless they grant you permission.@bo Otherwise, there is a difficulty: Why did Moshe ask the king of Edom to let them pass through his land, although Hashem forbade it? Therefore, Rashi explains: “Unless they grant you permission.” But with permission, they were allowed to pass through. @d1Until the day comes when there will be footsteps, etc.@bo There is a difficulty with the literal interpretation of this verse, for it should have only said, @hh<HEB>אף מדרך@it<ENG> (@ITeven@it a footstep). Why does Scripture use the term @hh<HEB>עד@it<ENG> (until), which denotes a time period? Therefore, Rashi quotes the homiletic explanation. @d1As a reward for his going along with him [Avrohom] to Egypt, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Hashem promised to give ten nations to Avrohom. Why then did He give these two to Lot? Therefore, Rashi explains: As a reward. @d1@p1[7]@p2<TIE>Therefore do not show ingratitude, etc.@bo This verse does not mean to say, “You therefore have no need for Eisov.” Otherwise it should say, “You have much,” or, “You have everything,” [instead of, “you have lacked nothing (@ITin the past@it)”] (@ITGur Aryeh@it). The term, “Your handiworks,” refers to livestock, as it is written (Iyov 1:10), “You have blessed his handiworks, and his livestock has spread over the land.” @p1[8]@p2<TIE>We turned our faces to travel, etc.@bo Rashi needed to explain, “We turned @ITnorthward@it,” because the verse (3), “Turn yourselves northward,” implies the turning of their heads now. Although they were not commanded to do so until after traversing the entire southern border of Moav, nevertheless, [they attempted to turn northward through the land of Edom, but] after they saw that Edom opposed them, they left and traversed the entire southern border of Moav. Afterwards they turned northward, as they were commanded when they were at the southern border of Edom. Then they traversed the entire eastern border of Moav until reaching the land of Sichon and Og, which was to the east of the Land of Israel, etc. (@ITRe”m@it). @p1[9]@p2<TIE>The only thing He forbid them, etc., war.@bo The verse should only have said, “Do not intimidate them.” Why is, “with war,” needed? For note that regarding the descendants of Ammon it only says below (v. 19), “Do not intimidate them.” Therefore Rashi answers: The only thing He forbids, etc. @d1But they were permitted to terrify them, etc.@bo I.e., the Jewish People were permitted to terrify the Moabites. @d1Do not intimidate them in any way, etc.@bo Because [regarding the people of Ammon,] it is not written “With war.” @d1Who named her son Moav.@bo I.e., @hh<HEB>מאב@it<ENG> (from father), which clearly indicates [her] immoral conduct. @d1The name of the country.@bo For if @hh<HEB>ער@it<ENG> means the same as @hh<HEB>עיר@it<ENG> (city), then the verse should mention the name of the city. @p1[10]@p2<TIE>That I gave to Avrohom, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Why does the verse need to say, “The Eimim originally lived there, etc.”? Rashi answers: You might think, etc. I.e., One of the seven nations that I gave to Avrohom was called Rephaim. If so you might think this [where Lot’s descendants settled] is the land of Rephaim. I.e., the Eimim who lived there [immediately before Lot’s descendants] were the Rephaim that I gave to Avrohom. But do not think this. Rashi continues to explain, “Because the Eimim, who are actually Rephaim, lived there originally, but the Eimim living there [immediately before Lot’s descendants] were a different people.” I.e., the Eimim that lived there originally, were already driven out [by the second Eimim] in favor of Lot’s descendants and [afterwards] Lot’s descendants settled there. Yet since this was no longer the land of [the original] Rephaim, why was it called “Rephaim”? Rashi explains: “Those Eimim were considered Rephaim.” Yet why were they called Rephaim if they were [actually] the Eimim? Rashi explains: Just as the Anokim were called Rephaim, etc., also the Eimim [were called Rephaim] — because whoever saw them, their hands became weak (@ITrafeh)@it from fright. And they [the actual Rephaim] were called Eimim because of the people’s fear (@ITeimah@it) of them, etc. This is how Rashi explains the context of these verses. @p1[12]@p2<TIE>I gave them the power, etc.@bo [Although @hh<HEB>יירשום@it<ENG> literally means, “He @ITwill@it drive them out.”] For any present progressive action may be expressed in the future tense or past tense. However, an action referring only to the present, as in (Shemos 15:1) @hh<HEB>אז ישיר משה@it<ENG> (Literally: Then Moshe @ITwill sing@it), must be explained as the thought to take action (@ITRe”m@it). @p1[15]@p2<TIE>To be further delayed in the wilderness.@bo For as long as any of them survived, their children could not enter the Land.<QC>
@p1[16]@p2<TIE>The word @HB<HEB>וידבר@BO<ENG> (He spoke) was not mentioned, only @HB<HEB>ויאמר@BO<ENG> (He said).@bo I.e., the term “He spoke” was not used affectionately, for “He spoke @ITto me@it” is not mentioned, as it is here. Instead it only said, “He spoke,” which lacks affection (@ITMaharitz@it). You might ask that, in Parshas Beha’aloscha (Bamidbar 12:1) regarding the verse, “Miriam spoke,” Rashi explains: “Spoke” implies harsh speech — not affection, whereas “said” implies affection. The answer is: Anywhere it is written, “@ITAdonoy@it spoke,” with the Tetragrammaton, it implies affection. Though it is harsh, it implies affection towards Moshe. But not, “Adonoy @ITsaid@it,” for this can mean, “Adonoy said @ITthrough a messenger@it.” As in (Bereishis 25:23), “Adonoy said to her,” which was through a messenger. And also as in (Shemos 18:6), “And he said to Moshe, ‘I am your father-in-law Yisro, etc.’” And also as in (Bereishis 48:1), “He said to Yoseif, ‘Behold your father is ill’.” In contrast, “he spoke,” implies affection, for it means, “(to be speaking) face-to-face,” as it says (Bamidbar 12:8), “Face-to-face I speak to him.” Although to any other prophet it would imply harsh speech, regarding Moshe it implies affection, as Hashem said, <NHS>(ibid. v. <NHS>7), <NHS>“Not so is My servant Moshe, etc.<NHS>” See Maseches Ta’anis (30b). @p1[23]@p2<TIE>That Avrohom swore to Avimelech, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: How does, “Arise to travel and cross, etc.” relate to the previous verse? [For Scripture implies:] Since the Caftorim destroyed the Avim and settled in their stead, this is the reason to arise to travel! Rashi answers: “Because of the oath, etc.” @p1[25]@p2<TIE>This teaches that the sun stood still, etc.@bo For it is written here, “I begin to@IT place@it,” and it says regarding Yehoshua (Yehoshua 10:12), “On the day that Adonoy @ITplaced@it, etc.” Just as the sun stood still over there, so too here, the sun stood still. @p1[26]@p2<TIE>Even though the Almighty did not command me, etc.@bo Otherwise, what is the significance of @hh<HEB>קדמות@it<ENG> (precedence)? Rashi comments: “Even though the Almighty did not command me, etc.” This implies that he holds that the verse, “When you near a city [to do battle against it] you are to offer it peace (below 20:10),” refers to an optional war. @d1Another explanation of “From the wilderness of Kedeimos”: From You I learned, etc.@bo According to the first explanation there is a difficulty: Why does it is written @hh<HEB>קדמות@it<ENG> (precedence)? There are many things that preceded the creation of the world. The verse should have been more specific. Therefore, Rashi says: “Another explanation, etc.” Yet according to the second explanation there is also a difficulty: Why does it say @hh<HEB>ממדבר@it<ENG> (from the wilderness). It fits well if “wilderness” is referring to the Torah, for it was given in the wilderness. But if it is referring to the Almighty, then why does it say “wilderness”? Therefore, both explanations are necessary. @p1[29]@p2<TIE>This does not refer to [our] passing through their land, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: The verse writes, “Food for money sell me.<TIE>.<TIE>. just let me cross on foot. As the descendants of Eisov did for me.” This implies that Edom [i.e., Eisov] allowed them to pass through their land. Yet, it is written in Parshas Chukas (Bamidbar 20:21), “Edom refused.<TIE>.<TIE>. and the Israelites turned away from them.” For this reason, Rashi explains: “This does not refer to [our] passing through etc.” You might ask: The verse here implies that Moav also sold food and water to them, but in Parshas Ki Teitzei it is written (below 23:4), “Neither an Ammonite nor a Moavite shall enter into the community.<TIE>.<TIE>. because they did not greet you with bread and water.” @ITRe”m@it answers: Perhaps there is a [significant] difference between @hh<HEB>קדמו@it<ENG> (greeting [with food]) and @hh<HEB>השבירו@it<ENG> (selling food). For the Moavites did not greet them with bread and water, but they did sell food and water to them. But the verse, “they did not greet you,” means without [charging] money. An alternative answer is: The verse means, “Neither an Ammonite nor a Moavite shall enter into the community — Ammon because they did not greet you, and Moav because they hired Bilaam against you, etc.” @d1This refers to the statement, “Let me pass through [your land].”@bo And not to the statement, “Food for money sell me,” which immediately precedes it. Otherwise, what is the meaning of, “[Sell me food] until I will have crossed the Yardein”? It should say instead, “Until I will have crossed your border,” as it is written in Parshas Chukas (Bamidbar 21:22). @p1[32]@p2<TIE>He did not send for Og, etc.@bo Because they were powerful.<QC>
@p1[33]@p2<TIE>It (@HB<HEB>בנו@BO<ENG>) is written, etc.@bo Since @hh<HEB>בנו@it<ENG> lacks the letter @ITyud@it, it [means “his son” and] implies that Sichon only had one son. Yet, since both syllables are vocalized with a @ITkamatz@it, it [means “his sons” and] implies that he had many sons. Rather the word @hh<HEB>בנו@it<ENG> indicates that Sichon had one son who was clearly recognizable as his son, for he was as mighty as his father. Therefore, it is written @hh<HEB>בנו@it<ENG> (his son), without a @ITyud@it. And this verse is informing us that he was killed just as all his other sons were killed.<QC>
@p1[37]@p2<TIE>All along Wadi Yabok.@bo (Literally, “The hand of Wadi Yabok”). Since a person’s hand is always at his side, any edge can be referred to as “hand.” See Parshas Shemos regarding the verse (2:5), “Walking on the edge (@hh<HEB>יד@it<ENG>) of the river.” @d1Not to capture, we left [uncaptured].@bo Literally, this verse implies that they did not attack what Hashem had commanded them to attack. Therefore, Rashi explains: “Not to capture, etc.”<QC>
@p1[4]@p2<TIE>I learned from this that, etc.@bo I.e., from @ITTargum Yerushalmi@it I learned that a palace is called @hh<HEB>טרכונין@it<ENG>, and then we can learn from this that @hh<HEB>ארגוב@it<ENG> also means a palace. The term @hh<HEB>הפרכיא@it<ENG>, in other words, means the Royal Palace. @d1In other words the empire is called after its name.@d2 I.e., an important city.<QC>
@p1[9]@p2<TIE>This is snow, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Since the letters of @hh<HEB>שרין@it<ENG> are the same as the letters of @hh<HEB>שניר@it<ENG>, except that the letters @ITresh@it and @ITnun@it switched places, then what is the reason [the verse needs to mention both]? Therefore, Rashi explains: Because of the snow it is called @hh<HEB>שניר@it<ENG> [but it is not called @hh<HEB>שרין@it<ENG>].<QC>
@p1[11]@p2<TIE>The @BIamoh@BO of Og.@bo Rashi is answering the question: It says in Maseches Berachos (54b) that Og uprooted a mountain that was three @ITparsoh @itsquared, implying that Og was a great giant. Yet in the verse here it is written that his bed was only “nine @ITamos@it long and four @ITamos@it wide in a man’s @ITamoh.@it”@IT @itIf this refers to the @ITamoh@it of the average man, then Og was only eight @ITamos@it tall — twice as tall as an average person plus another @ITamoh@it. If so, how then was he able to uproot a mountain? Therefore, Rashi explains: “The @ITamoh@it of Og.” @p1[12]@p2<TIE>“Mentioned above, etc.@bo I.e., it is not referring to the land mentioned afterwards, “From Aro’er which is on Wadi Arnon.” For the land they inherited at that time extended from Wadi Arnon to Mount Chermon, and not only from Aro’er until half of Mount Gilod. Rather, the verse means: “The land mentioned above that we took from the two kings, which extended from Wadi Arnon until Mount Chermon, we inherited it and fortified it.” Afterwards starts a new account: “From Aro’er which is on Wadi Arnon .<TIE>.<TIE>. I gave to the Reuvenites and the Gaddites, and I gave the rest to half the tribe of Menashe, etc.” @d1This is not to be connected .<TIE>.<TIE>. but with its conclusion, etc.@d2 Rashi is answering the question: The verse implies that they only inherited this land, and they gave it to the Reuvenites and the Gaddites. And afterwards it is written, “And the rest of the Gilod .<TIE>.<TIE>. I gave to half the tribe of Menashe.” But from where did they get this land, since they had not inherited any more land? For this reason Rashi explains: “This land” refers to the land mentioned above, “From Wadi Arnon to Mount Chermon,”, etc. In other words: The land mentioned above is what we inherited at that time, and from that land I gave to the Reuvenites, the Gaddites, and half the tribe of Menashe.<QC>
@p1[13]@p2<TIE>That is the land which I gave to Avrohom.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Above (2:11), it is also written, “The land of Rephaim”! However, this [land mentioned here] is the land of Rephaim that I gave to Avrohom. @p1[16]@p2<TIE>Until its opposite bank etc.@bo I.e., the inheritance of the Gaddites, which was on the eastern side of the Yardein, continues across the western edge of Wadi Arnon. For the verse, “and the border,” means: “This is the border [of their inheritance],” which continues until the wadi on the western side [of the Yardein]. And then it continues up until and includes Yabok. For, “even more,” also includes Yabok.<QC>
@p1[17]@p2<TIE>This is on the western side of the Yardein, etc.@bo I.e., the Kinneres is on the western side of the Yardein. Since the inheritance of the tribe of Gad was on the eastern side of the Yardein, we find that Gad’s inheritance extended from the eastern side of the Yardein along its entire width, and continued from [the eastern side of] the Yardein westward until the Kinneres. The phrase, “The Yardein and the border,” means that the Yardein itself is included in the inheritance, and also beyond until the Kinneres. @p1[18]@p2<TIE>He was speaking to Bnei Reuvein and Bnei Gad.@bo Rashi is answering the question: The rebuke from the beginning of this book until now was all directed at the entire Bnei Yisroel. But how can, “Cross over in the forefront ahead of your brothers Bnei Yisroel,” be referring to the Bnei Yisroel? Is it possible for Bnei Yisroel to cross over ahead of Bnei Yisroel?! Rashi therefore explains: He was speaking to Bnei Reuvein and Bnei Gad. @d1They went ahead of Bnei Yisroel, etc.@bo Otherwise, what is the meaning of, “ahead of Bnei Yisroel”? It should say instead, “@ITwith@it Bnei. Yisroel.”<QC>
@p1[23]@p2<TIE>The word @HB<HEB>חנון@BO<ENG> everywhere signifies, etc.@bo Otherwise, it should have said @hh<HEB>ואתפלל@it<ENG> (I prayed). @d1Because [the Almighty] had said to him, etc.@bo Rashi is saying: How did Moshe know to ask the Almighty even for an underserved gift, one that is not dependent upon good deeds? On this question Rashi explains, “I will be gracious, etc.” @d1There is another explanation: This is one of the ten terms.@bo According to the first explanation there is a difficulty: Why is it not written @hh<HEB>ואתחנם@it<ENG> (I asked for a free gift). Therefore Rashi says, “There is another explanation, etc.” But according to the second explanation there is a difficulty: Why does it not say @hh<HEB>ויחל@it<ENG> (implored) as above (Shmos 32:11). @d1By which prayer is described, as is stated in Sifrei.@bo The following [are the ten terms: 1.<TIE>@hh<HEB>שועה@it<ENG>. 2.<TIE>@hh<HEB>צעקה@it<ENG>. 3.<TIE>@hh<HEB>נאקה@it<ENG> (three types of crying out). 4.<TIE>@hh<HEB>רנה@it<ENG> (song). 5.<TIE>@hh<HEB>פצור@it<ENG> (press). 6.<TIE>@hh<HEB>קריאה@it<ENG> (call). 7.<TIE>@hh<HEB>נפול@it<ENG> (fall). 8.<TIE>@hh<HEB>פלל@it<ENG> (plead). 9.<TIE>@hh<HEB>פגיעה@it<ENG> (approach). 10.<TIE>@hh<HEB>תחנה@it<ENG> (supplicate). @d1After I had captured, etc.@bo Rashi has the following difficulty: Above it is written (Devarim 3:21), “And Yehoshua I commanded @ITat that time@it, etc.” which means at the time of capturing Sichon and Og. And, “I pleaded to Adonoy,” refers to that verse [therefore the phrase here, “at that time,” is apparently not necessary]. Rashi answers: After .<TIE>.<TIE>. I imagined that the vow had been partially cancelled. Therefore, [at that time] I thought to pray in order to enter the land, etc. (@ITRe”m@it). @d1I imagined that the vow had been cancelled.@bo You might ask: Since the vow had been cancelled, why then did Moshe need to pray? The answer is that Moshe thought the following: Before the land of Sichon and Og were conquered, it did not occur to me to pray because the Almighty had made a decree along with a vow, and therefore prayer would not help. But after conquering the land, and Bnei Gad, Bnei Reuvein, and half the tribe of Menashe inherited it, I thought that perhaps the vow had been cancelled — for a vow which is partially cancelled becomes totally void. If so, then the Almighty’s decree is without a vow and thus prayer will help. @d1This is one of the three occasions, etc.@bo @ITRe”m@it writes that Rashi is difficult to understand. For @ITSifrei@it lists five places, and Rabbi Elazar ben Azaria mentions four occasions where Moshe said, etc., and they are all listed explicitly. If so, Rashi’s words do not match either opinion. But it seems to me [the answer is]: Rashi’s commentary, “This is one of the three occasions, etc.,” means that Moshe prayed for these things and requested for the Almighty to fulfill his request and to make known to him if his request will be fulfilled. Such as regarding Miriam (Bamidbar 12:13) where Moshe requested she should be healed from @ITtzara’as@it. Also regarding (Ibid. 27:15), “Almighty, appoint etc.,” where Moshe requested that his sons inherit his position of leadership — as Rashi explains there. And also here, Moshe is praying to cross the Yardein. But the other two occasions quoted in @ITSifrei @itare different. “Moshe spoke before Adonoy saying, etc. (Shmos 6:12),” where Moshe requested to know if You would redeem them, etc. And also, when “Moshe cried out to Adonoy saying ‘What shall I do to this people,’, etc. (Ibid. 17:4),” where Moshe requested to know if he would fall into their hands, etc. These two occasions were only a request to be @ITinformed@it, but not a @ITrequest and prayer@it for the Almighty to fulfill what he is asking for. This answer can be found here in Rashi’s words, if you read the text carefully.<QC>
@p1[24]@p2<TIE>Merciful in judgement.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Hashem’s four-letter Name [Tetragrammaton] signifies His attribute of mercy, but the Name “Adonoy” signifies His attribute of justice [so how do we explain the two terms when they appear together]?. Therefore Rashi explains, “Merciful in judgement.” In other words, He judges with mercy, and not with harsh justice. An alternative approach is: Rashi is explaining why Hashem’s four-letter name here is vocalized as “Elohim,” with a @ITchataf-segol, cholam, and chirik,@it and not in the usual manner? Therefore Rashi says, “Adonoy Elohim,” even though it is written as “Adonoy.” In other words, it is [primarily] the four-letter Name, but according to its vocalization it is as if “Elohim” were written. So Rashi explains: Even though the four-letter Name is Hashem’s attribute of mercy, it is vocalized as “Elohim” to signify that He is merciful in judgment. And the first Name of Adonoy that appears in the verse, Moshe only intended as an introductory remark, “My Master.” According to the first explanation, Rashi must have said, “Elohim,” because that is how the four-letter name is read. Although above in Parshas Lech Lecha it is written, “Adonoy Elohim what will you give me (Bereishis 15:2),” and Rashi offers no explanation. The answer is: The verse in Bereishis means to say: Whether out of justice, or whether out of mercy, I request for You to give me children because You had said to me, “Go for yourself from your homeland .<TIE>.<TIE>. and I will make you into a great nation (Ibid. 12:1).” But here it is difficult to understand why it needs to say the Name Adonoy, which signifies Hashem’s attribute of justice. @d1An opportunity to stand and pray, etc.@bo Otherwise, it should say, “You have shown Your servant etc.” As [the significance of, “@ITYou have begun@it to show,”] Rashi explains further on. @d1And now please magnify the Might.@bo Afterwards it is written, “Adonoy said, ‘I have forgiven you as you said.’<HS><HS>” In other words: Your attribute of goodness is that you forgive those who transgress Your will. @d1Which is extended to all who enter the world.@bo It is extended to accept whoever repents. This is also part of Moshe’s prayer. @d1You subdue with [Your] compassion, etc.@bo This is also part of Moshe’s prayer. But it does not mean the same as, “For by [My] strong hand he will let them go (Shmos 6:1),” for how does this relate to Moshe’s prayer? @d1You are unlike a king of flesh and blood.@bo This is also part of Moshe’s prayer. But it does not mean that there is none like You, as in, “For there is no power like You, etc. (Tehillim 81:8).” For how does this relate to Moshe’s prayer?<QC>
@d1Who has advisors and critics, etc.@bo The term @hh<HEB>סנקנתדרין@it<ENG> means “critics.” @d1But according to its simplistic sense [it means]; You have begun to show your servant, etc.@bo Also according to its simplistic sense it is part of Moshe’s prayer. In other words: Since You have begun to show me the two wars with Sichon and with Og, show me also the wars with the thirty-one kings. @p1[25]@p2<TIE>The word @HB<HEB>נא@BO<ENG> is a term denoting a request.@bo I.e., pertaining to the word @hh<HEB>נא@it<ENG> appearing here. But [where it appears] elsewhere in the Torah it means, “now.” @d1A reference to Jerusalem.@bo As it is written, “Jerusalem is surrounded by mountains (Tehillim 125:2).” @d1A reference to the @BIBais HaMikdosh.@bo Why is the @ITBais HaMikdosh@it called, “Levanon”? Because it whitens (@ITm’labein @iti.e., cleanses) a person of his sins.<QC>
@p1[26]@p2<TIE>He was filled with wrath.@bo The term @hh<HEB>ויתעבר@it<ENG> is related to the term @hh<HEB>עברה@it<ENG> (wrath). @d1You caused this [to happen] to me, etc.@bo I.e., Because I had said to you, “Listen you rebellious ones (Bamidbar 20:10),” on account of this sin Hashem decreed that I shall not enter the Land. Rashi quotes a proof: Similarly is states, “.<TIE>.<TIE>.and Moshe suffered harm because of them (Tehillim 106:32).” For that verse means the same as here: “Because of them,” means that Moshe suffered because they caused him harm. The word @hh<HEB>למענכם@it<ENG> (lit., because of you) does not mean, “Because He is doing as you wish and you do not wish for me to enter the Land,” as in, “Because of you (@hh<HEB>למענכם@it<ENG>) I was sent to Babylon (Yeshayah 43:14).” @d1So that people should not say “How harsh is the Master,”, etc.@bo The term @hh<HEB>רב לך@it<ENG> means, “master,” as if Hashem were saying: “Since I am your Master and you are my disciple, you must listen to your Master, and you may not stubbornly oppose Me so that, etc.” @d1Another explanation of @HB<HEB>רב לך@BO<ENG>, Much more than this, etc.@bo The first reason is problematic, for the verse should say @hh<HEB>רב אני@it<ENG> (I am your Master). Therefore, Rashi suggests, “Another explanation, etc.” But the second reason by itself is also problematic, for the verse should say @hh<HEB>רב טוב לך@it<ENG> (great is the goodness) [that is hidden away for you]. Therefore, the first reason is also needed. @d1Great is the goodness that is hidden away for you.@bo I.e., the goodness that is hidden away for you in the World to Come is greater than [the goodness] you would have from entering the Land.<QC>
@p1[27]@p2<TIE>I will show you all of it, etc.@bo Rashi is explaining how the Almighty is answering Moshe’s request to cross the Yardein. For how does, “Go up to the peak of the Pisgah .<TIE>.<TIE>. see with your own eyes, etc,” relate to Moshe’s question? Rashi explains: You asked of Me to see [only] the good mountain and the Levanon, which refers to Yerusholayim and the Beis Hamikdosh — the best of all the Land. But I will show you @ITall@it of it, which is more than you had requested. @p1[28]@p2<TIE>Regarding the troubles, the burdens, etc.@bo As the verse says (above 1:12), “Your troublesomeness, your burdensomeness, and your contentiousness.” For if @hh<HEB>וצו@it<ENG> (command) is referring to @hh<HEB>אמצהו וחזקהו@it<ENG> (embolden him and encourage him), then @hh<HEB>וחזקהו@it<ENG> would not be preceded by a @ITvov@it (and), which implies that besides the command given to Yehoshua, you are also to encourage him and embolden him. We see from this that the command is one matter, and “encourage him and embolden him,” is a separate matter. @d1With your words so that he will not become faint-<FJ> hearted, etc.@bo I.e., not with your actions, for you are not able to encourage him and embolden him except with words. In other words, I assure him that he will cross over. For afterwards Rashi says: “He will cross over, etc.” We see from this that the encouraging and emboldening is with speech. @d1If he will cross at the head [of this people] they will possess [the land], but if not, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: The verse only needed to say @hh<HEB>ינחיל@it<ENG> (and he will apportion), etc. Rather the [extra] word @hh<HEB>והוא@it<ENG> (and he) is intended to teach us that only when @IThe @itwill cross, then they will possess, but if not, etc. @d1And when he fell on his face, he [Hashem] said to him, etc.@bo I.e., when the Israelites were being killed in the war against Ai, Yehoshua fell [in supplication] before Hashem. @d1It [the word @HB<HEB>קם@BO<ENG>] is written [without the @BIvov@BO], etc.@bo In other words: [The defeat was] because you remained in your place and did not go with them.<QC>
@p1[29]@p2<TIE>And you attached yourselves to idolatry, etc.@bo Rashi is saying: The preceding verse was dealing with the Almighty’s response to Moshe, that he shall not enter the Land. [So now,] Moshe says to the Jewish People, “We lived in the valley,” meaning that you attached yourselves to idolatry and sinned by worshipping it. Nevertheless they are told, “And now Yisroel, etc.” I.e., despite this, you will enter the Land, but I, etc. [Rashi explains in this way,] even though “And now, etc.,” is a separate paragraph. There are other verses that are understood in the same way, such as, “And it was after the plague. And Adonoy said to Moshe, etc. (Bamidbar 26:1).” You might ask: Why does Moshe mention this sin more than any other that they committed in the wilderness? The answer is: Moshe mentions the sin of facing Beis Peor to say that even though they sinned, the Almighty will forgive them through Moshe’s burial [being there]. For this is the reason that Moshe is buried outside the Land, as it is written in Parshas Vezos Habracha (below 34:6), “He buried him in the valley, in the land of Moav facing Beis Peor.” And Rashi explains there that Moshe was buried facing Beis Peor, outside the Land, to atone for their sin of idolatry that they committed in Beis Peor (attributed to the @ITMaharitz@it). @p1[6]@p2<TIE>This refers to the study of the Mishnah.@bo “Preserve,” is to study, and “fulfill” is to uphold the mitzvos. For whoever does not learn, does not fulfill. @d1Through this you will be considered wise, etc.@bo Rashi changes the nouns, “wisdom and understanding,” into adjectives. This is because wisdom and understanding are not valued by the nations in their own right, and therefore it would not be logical for the verse to say, “In the eyes of the nations.” Rashi therefore adds the word @hh<HEB>תחשבו@it<ENG> (you will be considered), meaning that, “your status will be considered as wise and understanding in their eyes.”<QC>
@p1[8]@p2<TIE>That are proper and acceptable.@bo Rashi intends to explain: How can the expression “righteous” apply to statutes and laws? For this expression applies only to people! Therefore Rashi explains: “Righteous” [means] “that are proper, etc.,” [an expression] which is applicable to statutes. @p1[9]@p2<TIE>Will you be considered wise and understanding, etc.@bo Rashi intends to explain: Why it is written @hh<HEB>רק@it<ENG> (only), which is an exclusionary term? For what is being excluded here? Therefore Rashi says: “Only” is referring to the above verse, “For that displays your wisdom and your understanding etc.” Under which conditions will you be considered wise and understanding? If you do not forget them, etc.<QC>
@p1[10]@p2<TIE>On the day you stood at Choreiv, etc.@bo One should not say, “You should make known (@hh<HEB>תודיע@it<ENG>) to your children the day you stood,” because @hh<HEB>והודעתם@it<ENG> is written with the suffix @ITmem@it, meaning “them.” This implies that it is referring to the above, “Lest you forget @ITthe words@it your eyes witnessed .<TIE>.<TIE>. you will make @ITthem@it known,” meaning to make the words known. If it were referring to the verse following, it should say only, “You should make known to your children.” [@ITGur Aryeh@it]. @d1For themselves.@bo Rashi is saying: The word @hh<HEB>ילמדון@it<ENG>, which Unkelos translates as @hh<HEB>ילפון@it<ENG>, means, “They will learn for themselves.” But the word @hh<HEB>ילמדון@it<ENG> later on, which the @ITTargum@it translates as @hh<HEB>יאלפון@it<ENG>, means, “They will teach others.”<QC>
@p1[14]@p2<TIE>This refers to the Oral Law.@bo Rashi is answering the question: “[Adonoy] commanded me,” definitely refers to the previous verse, “He told you His covenant .<TIE>.<TIE>. @ITthe ten statements@it.” But if the Almighty commanded Moshe to teach the Jewish People at that time (when they had only been commanded the ten statements), then what is “statutes and laws” referring to? Rather, it must refer to the Oral Law that accompanied the ten statements, which includes their general rules, particular details, and all the @ITmitzvos@it contained in them. @ITGur Aryeh@it explains: [Rashi says, “the Oral Law,”] because it is written, “to teach.” For regarding the Written Law, the word, “give,” would be more appropriate. Since it is written, a person is able to learn it by himself [without being taught].<QC>
@p1[19]@p2<TIE>To speculate about the matter and to set your heart, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: It is written, “Or lest you raise your eyes [heavenward], etc.” But will a person come to worship them just because he raises his eyes heavenward? Therefore, Rashi explains: “To speculate about the matter, etc.”<QC>
@d1To provide them with light.@bo Rashi is answering the question: It is written, “And worship them .<TIE>.<TIE>. has made them available, etc.” But did the Holy One Blessed Is He make them available for all the peoples @ITto worship them@it? @d1Another explanation: [He made them available] as deities. He did not prevent them, etc.@bo Hashem did not make them available as deities, for He did not create them for this purpose. However, He did not prevent them, etc. Rather, He caused them to slip with matters of nonsense, for it appears to them that the benefit they get is attained by worshipping the stars. But in reality they are bad, [and their purpose is] to banish the people. @d1From blundering after them, etc.@bo The first explanation is problematic, for why does it say, “to them”? Do the stars shine only for them? Therefore, Rashi says, “Another explanation.” Yet, the second explanation is problematic, for why did Hashem create something in the first place that will cause people to err? Is it not written, “The world was built with kindness (Tehillim 89:3)”? Therefore, both reasons are necessary.<QC>
@p1[23]@p2<TIE>The likeness of any object.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Wherever the word @hh<HEB>כל@it<ENG> (any or all) is written in Scripture, the word afterwards is connected to it. Many examples are found, such as in this Parsha: “All the years (v. 10),” and “Any form (v. 16).” Therefore Rashi explains that it is as if Scripture had written, “any @ITobject@it.” @d1That He commanded you not to make.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Did the Holy One Blessed Is He command you to make an image [as a literal reading of the verse would imply]? Therefore, Rashi explains: That He commanded you @ITnot@it to make. @p1[24]@p2<TIE>He is jealous to take vengeance, etc.@bo Rashi explains: He is not called “jealous,” because He has the attribute of jealousy (God forbid), for He is neither jealous, nor angry, nor quarrelsome. Rather, He is called “jealous,” because He quarrels and shows anger to punish idol worshippers. Since the vengeance only comes as a result of the jealousy, therefore “A jealous Almighty,” is written instead of, “A vengeful Almighty.” @p1[25]@p2<TIE>Eight hundred and fifty-two years etc.@bo It is written regarding the building of the first @ITBeis Hamikdosh@it (Melochim I, 6:1), “And it was in the four hundred and eightieth year, etc,” and the first @ITBeis Hamikdosh @itstood for 410 years [for a total of 890 years until the first exile]. Subtract from them the forty years that the Jewish People were in the wilderness which is included in the total, because the verse counts the time of leaving Egypt. We find that they were in the Land for only 850 years. They did not reach 852 years, the numerical value of @hh<HEB>ונושנתם@it<ENG>, as Rashi explains. @d1“For Adonoy our God is righteous He acted charitably etc.”@bo Rashi is answering the question: How is it righteous of Hashem that He precipitated the evil and brought it upon us? The answer is that it was righteous of God to bring the evil before the time of @hh<HEB>ונושנתם@it<ENG> [after 852 years, when the Jewish people would “have grown old in the Land” and deserve to be completely destroyed, as stated below in v.26]. See Maseches Sanhedrin 38a. @p1[26]@p2<TIE>I have designated them to be witnesses, etc.@bo I.e., they are witnesses as to Hashem’s warning, but they are not witnesses as to the committing of the sin. For the Jewish People had not yet done evil in Hashem’s eyes.<QC>
@p1[28]@p2<TIE>Since you will serve those who worship them, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Just because Hashem will disperse them among the peoples, they will serve man-made gods? The answer is: As the Targum, etc.<QC>
@p1[31]@p2<TIE>He will not cause you to be weakened, etc.@bo I.e., the word @hh<HEB>ארפנו@it<ENG> [@ITerpenu@it], is the simple (@hh<HEB>קל@it<ENG>), intransitive verb form. For example, “Behold, the day faded (@hh<HEB>רפה@it<ENG>) into evening (Shoftim 19:9),” and, “Their spirit subsided (@hh<HEB>רפתה@it<ENG>) (ibid. 8:3).” Therefore, Rashi explains that @hh<HEB>לא ירפך@it<ENG> [@ITyarpecha,@it rather than @ITyerpecha@it], is the causative (@hh<HEB>הפעיל@it<ENG>), transitive verb form. Its meaning is, “He will not cause you to be weakened.” (@ITRe”m@it). @d1The word @HB<HEB>ארפנו@BO<ENG> [@BIarpenu@BO] is not vocalized @HB<HEB>ארפנו@BO<ENG> [@BIerpenu@BO], etc.@bo I.e., the word @hh<HEB>ארפנו@it<ENG> should not be vocalized with a @ITshva @itunder the @ITaleph@it, and a @ITpatach@it under the @ITreish@it, it would be a form of the word, “heal (@hh<HEB>רפא@hh@ee<ENG>).” But now that @hh<HEB>ארפנו@it<ENG> is vocalized with a @ITpatach@it under the @ITaleph@it and a @ITshva@it under the @ITreish@it, it is a form of the word, “weaken (@hh<HEB>רפה@hh@ee<ENG>).” @d1“Leave her alone” — let her be released, etc.@bo Its meaning is, “Let her be released,” which is an example of the causative verb form. @d1 “Leave Me alone” — release yourself from Me.@bo Its meaning is, “Leave Me alone,” which is an example of the reflexive verb form. @p1[32]@p2<TIE>Regarding the early years.@bo [Rashi inserts, “regarding”] because one cannot inquire of years. @d1Regarding the height of Adam @BOetc.@bo For it is written, “That Hashem created Adam on earth [and from one end of the heavens, etc.]” @d1Which reached from earth to heaven, etc.@bo The phrase, “And from one end of the heavens,” means, “the height of Adam was from earth to heaven.” For if understood simply, then what is the meaning of, “[Inquire .<TIE>.<TIE>. from the day Hashem created Adam] until the end of the heavens”? @d1Which is the same measurement, etc.@bo [On one hand] the verse implies [that Adam’s height was] “from one end of the world until the other,” as it is written, “and from one end of the heavens to the other end of the heavens [east to west].” Yet, [on the other hand] it implies that Adam’s height was “from the earth until the heavens,” as it is written, “.<TIE>.<TIE>.on earth until one end of the heavens.” How can this be resolved? Rather, it is the same measurement, etc. In other words, the circumference of the heavens — its uppermost limit — is one end [of the heavens], and the center of heaven — which is the earth — is the other end [of the heavens], and this measurement is exactly the same as, “from the heaven until the earth.” It is as if the verse says, “From one end of the heaven until the other, which is from the heaven until the earth.” According to this, the expressions, “From the earth until the firmament,” and, “From the earth until one end of the heavens,” and, “From one end of the heavens until the other end of the heavens,” and, “From one end of the world until the other end,” are all the same, they only differ in what they are called.<QC>
@p1[35]@p2<TIE>The word @HB<HEB>הראת@BO<ENG> according to Targum Unkelos means “You were shown”, etc.@bo I.e., the word @hh<HEB>הראת@it<ENG> means, “you were shown,” rather than, “you showed.” Otherwise, the Targum should say @hh<HEB>אחזית@it<ENG> (you showed) instead of @hh<HEB>איתחזיתא@it<ENG>.<QC>
@p1[37]@p2<TIE>And all this was because He loved [your fathers].@bo Rashi is answering the question: Why is the word @hh<HEB>ותחת@it<ENG> (and because) written with a letter @ITvov@it? Rashi answers: Because it is a continuation of the previous verses, “.<TIE>.<TIE>.and all this, etc.” @d1Like a man who leads his son before him, etc.@bo The word @hh<HEB>בפניו@it<ENG> (literally, “in His presence,”) here means @hh<HEB>לפניו@it<ENG> (before Him). Similarly (below 25:9), “And she shall spit before him (@hh<HEB>בפניו@it<ENG>).” Also, according to Rashi’s second explanation, @hh<HEB>בפניו@it<ENG> means “before him.” The only difference is that in the second explanation, “before him,” refers to the forefathers. @d1Do not be puzzled that it refers to them (the fathers) in the singular, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Why then is it written, “before @IThim@it”? According to the second explanation above, “before him” refers to their fathers, [so why then is] in the singular form? Rashi explains: “And He chose @IThis@it descendants after @IThim@it.” In other words: Consider even the first explanation where, “before @IThim@it,” poses no difficulty because it refers to Hashem. Nevertheless the phrase, “.<TIE>.<TIE>.your forefathers, He chose @IThis@it descendants after @IThim@it,” is difficult to understand. For it must be that, “He chose @IThis@it etc,” refers to the forefathers, even according to the first explanation. Nevertheless it says, “his descendants after @IThim@it,” which is in the singular form. If so, even according to the second explanation where, “before him,” also refers to the fathers, it is not difficult to understand, though it is written in the singular form. And both explanations are necessary: The first explanation is problematic, for it should say, “And He took you out @ITand led you@it before Him.” Therefore Rashi says, “Another explanation, etc.” But the second explanation alone is also problematic — since the forefathers already had died, then what is the meaning of, “in front of him”? Therefore the first explanation is also needed.<QC>
@p1[41]@p2<TIE>He gave thought in his heart to be concerned about the matter, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: The word @hh<HEB>אז@it<ENG> (then) means immediately. Yet the word @hh<HEB>יבדיל@it<ENG> (set aside) is in the future tense. Therefore, Rashi explains that it refers to his intentions [I.e., Moshe intended then to set the cities aside in the future]. But @ITRe”m@it explains: Setting aside these cities is not an ongoing action, thus the present tense does not apply to it. Therefore Rashi explains that it refers to his intentions. In other words, Moshe constantly had in mind to set aside these cities until they were actually set aside. @d1On that side which is, etc.@bo Rashi is explaining: “Across the Yardein” may refer to the eastern side [of the Yardein] or to [the western side of the Yardein, ie.,] the side of the Land of Israel. Therefore the verse says, “where the sun rises,” to let us know which side of the Yardein it refers to, and that it is not the [western] side of the Land of Israel where the sun sets. @d1The letter @BIreish@BO is vocalized with a @BIchataf.@bo I.e., it is vocalized with a @ITsheva@it, which is called a @ITchataf@it.<QC>
@p1[45]@p2<TIE>They are the very same [testimonies, etc.] that he spoke when they went out of Egypt, etc.@bo @itOtherwise, why does the verse say here that Moshe addressed Bnei Yisroel when they came out of Egypt? Rashi explains that, “These are the testimonies,” is connected to, “And this is the Torah (v. 44).” Meaning: This is the Torah, [referring to] the testimonies set forth after this chapter, are the very same testimonies that Moshe spoke when they went out of Egypt, and they were reviewed and taught to Bnei Yisroel in the plains of Moav. The verses are [as if they were] abridged. @p1[3]@p2<TIE>[Not with our forefathers] alone did Adonoy make this, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: The verse implies that Hashem gave the Ten Commandments exclusively to us, and not to our fathers who already died. But, many were alive when the Torah was given, in the year after leaving Egypt. This covenant was also made with them, though now they are not alive. Therefore, Rashi explains: Not with our forefathers @ITalone@it did Adonoy make this covenant, etc., but also with us. @p1[4]@p2<TIE>The seller himself, etc.@bo This is the meaning of, “Face to face.”<QC>
@p1[5]@p2<TIE>[The word @HB<HEB>לאמר@BO<ENG> (saying)] is connected with, “Adonoy spoke etc.”@bo For how could it be that, “Saying,” is connected to the phrase that immediately precedes it, “and did not go up on the mountain saying”? For what did they have to say on the mountain? Rather, the verse interrupts between [the phrases], “from within the fire,” and, “saying.” This is to emphasize that I [Moshe] was the agent between Hashem and you, because you were afraid of the fire and did not go up on the mountain. @p1[7]@p2<TIE>In any place where I am, etc.@bo This explanation is problematic, for the verse should have said @hh<HEB>בפני@it<ENG> (in My Presence). Therefore Rashi says, “Another explanation.” Yet the second explanation is problematic, for the verse should have said @hh<HEB>לעולם@it<ENG> (forever). [According to the second explanation] it is possible to err, God forbid [and think that idolatry is only forbidden on Har Sinai where Hashem revealed Himself. Therefore Rashi also says the first explanation. See above in Parshas Yisro (Shmos 20:3), where I explained why Rashi gives two reasons here, yet above he only says one. Also see the @ITGur Aryeh@it. @p1[12]@p2<TIE>Were pronounced simultaneously as one word, etc.@bo When it previously states that when, “Remember,” was said, “Preserve,” was also said — for both were miraculously pronounced as one word, etc. And unlike the other commandments, Rashi explains this once again here and does not rely on his explanation above (Shmos 20:8). This is because it is written here, “As [Adonoy, your God,] commanded you,” which is the basis for the teaching that, “Remember,” and, “Preserve,” were pronounced as one word. Therefore Rashi repeated his explanation here, in its proper place. @d1Before the giving of the Torah at Marah.@bo The verse (above 4:45), “These are the statutes, etc.,” implies that the Ten Commandments here were said exactly the same as they were said above. If so, how could Moshe add here, “As Adonoy commanded you, etc.”? [Therefore, it cannot refer to the first Ten Commandments, but it must refer to Marah.]. Rashi explains likewise in Maseches Sanhedrin 56b: Moshe could not have said, “As Adonoy commanded you @ITat Sinai@it” in the plains of Moav. For Moshe did not repeat the @ITMishnah Torah @itand warn about its commandments of his own accord. Rather, he repeated them just as he had received them. And whatever was written in the repetition of the Ten Commandments was written on the Tablets, and was heard at Sinai. See further in Tosefos (Maseches Shabbos 87b) where a difficulty is raised: Perhaps “As Adonoy commanded, etc.,” refers to the manna (Shmos 16:23) where Hashem also commanded them regarding Shabbos. The answer is: Regarding honoring one’s father and mother it is also written (v.16), “as Adonoy commanded, etc,” which cannot refer to the manna. For regarding the manna, Hashem did not command them about honoring one’s father and mother. Therefore, “as Adonoy commanded” mentioned regarding Shabbos also does not refer to the manna. @p1[15]@p2<TIE>He freed you on the condition, etc.@bo Because Hashem knows that it is difficult for them to abstain from work. We find this regarding Purim, that they accepted upon themselves a day of drinking and rejoicing, but not for [abstaining from] work (Maseches Megillah 5b). Therefore, he mentions to them that they were slaves. That is to say, when a master tells his slave to abstain from work, it is only right that the slave obeys him because the work [he does] is only for his master. Otherwise, why is slavery mentioned here? [Maharai]. @p1[17]@p2<TIE>The term @HB<HEB>נאוף@BO<ENG> (adultery), etc.@bo You might ask: Why does Rashi explain this [commandment] more than the other Ten Commandments? The answer is that Rashi is answering the question: Why is the letter @ITvov @itin @hh<HEB>ולא תנאף@it<ENG> necessary? Rashi answers: The term “adultery” is applicable only in reference to a married woman. Additionally, the @ITvov@it indicates that “do not commit adultery” is a continuation of the preceding matter, “Do not murder.” In other words: Be careful with the commandment, “Do not murder,” and through this you will distance yourself from many other transgressions. One [such transgression] is, “Do not commit adultery.” For one [who wishes to commit adultery] will think, “perhaps the husband will not hand over his wife,” and because of this he may commit murder. So too with all [the commandments] mentioned afterwards. See @ITKitzur Mizrachi@it for a different explanation. @p1[18]@p2<TIE>Which is also an expression of desiring, etc.@bo I.e., one should not ask: [Why] over there (Shmos 20:14) is it written @hh<HEB>לא תחמוד@it<ENG> (do not covet), but here it is written @hh<HEB>לא תתאוה@it<ENG> (lit., do not desire)? Rashi explains: Which is also, etc. And therefore the Targum says @hh<HEB>לא תירוג@it<ENG>, which is an expression of desiring. @p1[19]@p2<TIE>Because His voice is strong and eternal, etc.@bo The first explanation is problematic, for it is obvious. Since the sound of His voice is strong [and eternal] the first time, why then would His voice pause? Therefore Rashi says, “Another explanation, etc.” But the second explanation is problematic. Why does it say @hh<HEB>יסף@it<ENG> [which can mean “stop”]? It should say @hh<HEB>יוסיף@it<ENG> [which clearly means, “did not continue”]! Therefore Rashi also gives the first explanation. @d1In such a public demonstration.@bo The word @hh<HEB>פומבי@it<ENG> means, “a public demonstration.”<QC>
@p1[24]@p2<TIE>You have diminished my strength like that of a woman, etc.@bo For the second-person masculine is @hh<HEB>אתה@it<ENG>, and the second-person feminine is @hh<HEB>את@it<ENG>.<QC>
@d1For I was distressed about you and you weakened my hands, etc.@bo Everyone raises the question: Had not Hashem agreed to their words and said, “Everything they said is excellent (v. 25)”? The answer is: [This verse] is presenting Moshe’s opinion, for he suspected the reason for their speaking in this manner was because they were not anxious to come near to Him out of love. And [in the next verse] Hashem says to Moshe that the reason for their speaking in this manner was because of their fear of Him. Hashem said all this to remove Moshe’s suspicion of the Jewish People.<QC>
@p1[4]@p2<TIE>Adonoy Who is presently our God, etc.@bo Otherwise it should say, “Listen, Yisroel! Adonoy is one.” Rather, the verse means: Listen, Yisroel! Now He is only [recognized as] our God, but the time will come, etc. In other words, all the idolaters will acknowledge that He is One in heaven and on earth, and in all four directions. And this is the Oneness that our sages derive from this verse, as Scripture says (Zechariah 14:9), “On that day Adonoy will be King.<TIE>.<TIE>.Adonoy will be One, etc.” @p1[5]@p2<TIE>You are to obey His words because of your love [for Him], etc.@bo [@ITRe”m@it says:] I do not understand. For here Rashi explains, “You are to love — You are to obey His words (commands) because of your love [for Him], etc.” This apparently refers to all the mitzvos. And afterwards Rashi explains, “With all your soul — even if He were to take your soul.” This implies to give up one’s life rather than transgress [any mitzvah]. Yet in [Maseches] Sanhedrin (74a) it says that “With all your soul” means, “even if He were to take your soul.” And Rashi explains there: The verse, “You are to love Adonoy, your God,” means that you should not exchange Him for idolatry. Therefore it says “with all your soul,” meaning that your love for Him should be more dear to you than anything else. This implies that the verse is referring only to idolatry, but regarding other mitzvos one should rather transgress rather than give up his life! @ITRe”m@it leaves this question unresolved. (See also the @ITKitzur Mizrachi@it and @ITGur Aryeh@it). @d1With your two inclinations.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Why is the letter @ITbeis@it written twice in the word @hh<HEB>לבבך@it<ENG> (your heart)? Rashi explains: With your two inclinations. @d1Another interpretation “with all your heart” — your heart should not be fragmented, etc.@bo The first interpretation is problematic, for is the heart actually a person’s inclination that the verse could say [about the heart], “with your two inclinations”? Therefore Rashi says, “Another interpretation, etc.” Yet the second interpretation is problematic, for why does it say @hh<HEB>לבבך@it<ENG> (with the letter @ITbeis@it written twice)? It should say instead @hh<HEB>לבך@it<ENG>. Therefore, the first interpretation is also needed. @d1There are men whose wealth, etc.@bo Otherwise, Scripture should write only one of them [either heart or soul], and we would derive the other from it. Why are both needed? Rather, there are men, etc. Both are stated so as not to leave room for the evil inclination. Likewise it is explained in Maseches Yuma 82a, and in Maseches Sanhedrin 74a (@ITMaharan@it). @d1Another interpretation .<TIE>.<TIE>. with what ever measure, etc.@bo The first interpretation is problematic, for it should have said @hh<HEB>ממונך@it<ENG> (your wealth). Therefore Rashi explains, “Another interpretation, etc.” Yet the second interpretation is problematic, for it should have said @hh<HEB>מדך@it<ENG> (your measure). Therefore the first interpretation is also needed. @p1[6]@p2<TIE>What is the form of love, etc.@bo Otherwise, how is it possible to love something that one has never seen or comprehended? But by the means of these words (the commandments) being on your heart, through them you will recognize Hashem. For if the world were not created according to His will, then He would not have given us commandments. And because you will know that He is the Creator and He is the source of everything, you will love Him and desire to know Him. @d1Which no one takes seriously, etc.@bo The term @hh<HEB>סופנה@it<ENG> means, “importance.”<QC>
@d1But rather like a newly given one which is read eagerly by all, etc.@bo For this reason it is written, “today,” i.e., as if it was [first] said today. Otherwise, what is the meaning of “today”? Had not already forty years passed since it (and the entire Torah) was commanded to the Jewish People. @ITRe”m@it writes likewise regarding the verse (7:11), “.<TIE>.<TIE>.today, to fulfill.” @p1[7]@p2<TIE>[The word @HB<HEB>שננתם@BO<ENG>] is an expression of sharpness, etc.@bo This is the same term as in, “@ITSharp@it (@hh<HEB>שנונים@it<ENG>) arrows of the mighty (Tehillim 120:4).” But it is not from the term @hh<HEB>משנה@it<ENG> (teach), otherwise it should say @hh<HEB>ולמדתם@it<ENG> (teach them) [as we find in the second paragraph of the Shema (@ITRe”m@it)]. @d1[In this instance @HB<HEB>בניך@BO<ENG>] refers to the disciples, etc.@bo If it actually means “sons,” then why is it necessary to say? For it is written previously (v. 2), “You and your son and your grandson,” but here it is written only, “your sons”! Rather, it must be referring to the disciples. @d1Your main discussions should be only about them, etc.@bo Otherwise it should say @hh<HEB>ודברת אותם@it<ENG> (speak them). Rather the word @hh<HEB>בם@it<ENG> emphasizes to speak, “about them,” and not about other matters. @d1It is therefore stated, “When you sit at home and when you journey”, etc.@bo It seems to me that Rashi should be explained as follows: One should not say that, “When you go to sleep and when you rise,” should be taken literally — meaning even at midday or midnight. For it is written, “When you sit at home and when you journey on the road, and when you go to sleep and when you rise.” If so, a person should recite the Shema all day and all night. And if this is so, then it should say, “You are to discuss them day and night.” Rather, the Torah speaks of the usual way of life, etc. And then [it follows that], “When you go to sleep and when you rise,” is an explanation of, “When you sit at home and when you journey on the road.” The verse should be understood as: “When you sit at home, etc.” And [exactly] when? “At the time of sleeping and arising,” which is morning and evening. (@ITKitzur Mizrachi@it).<QC>
@p1[8]@p2<TIE>It is due to the number of Scriptural sections [contained in them] that they are called @BItotafos,@BO etc.@bo I.e., it is as if the word, “two,” is written twice. The word @hh<HEB>טט@it<ENG> means “two.” @d1For @HB<HEB>טט@BO<ENG> in Coptic language means two.@bo In the Coptic language when they wish to say, “two,” they say @hh<HEB>טט@it<ENG>. @d1And @HB<HEB>פת@BO<ENG> in the African language means two.@bo In the African language when they wish to say, “two,” they say @hh<HEB>פת@it<ENG>. This is [a total of] four. In other words, four Scriptural sections are contained in each of the @ITtefillin@it. See @ITTosefos@it in Sanhedrin (4b) for further elaboration. @p1[9]@p2<TIE>Only one is necessary.@bo Meaning that one doorway [with two doorposts] does not require two @ITmezuzos@it. Rather, each entrance in the house needs [only] one. This [explanation of Rashi] disagrees with the opinion that says [even] a doorway that has only a doorpost on  one side requires a @ITmezuzah@it. (Menachos 34a). @p1[12]@p2<TIE>From the place where you were slaves.@bo The meaning of “from the house of slavery,” is, “from the place where you were slaves.” The verse does not mean [literally], “from the house of slaves,” for the Jewish People were not enslaved to slaves. @p1[13]@p2<TIE>If you possess all these qualities, etc.@bo The meaning is not [as inferred by the simple reading of the text] that it is it a @ITmitzvah @itto swear, as in “Fear Adonoy,” and, “serve Him,” where each is a separate @ITmitzvah@it. Rather, if you possess all these qualities, etc. otherwise you should not swear. And if so, then the prefix @ITvov@it of @hh<HEB>ובשמו@it<ENG> is extra, and the word @hh<HEB>אם@it<ENG> (if) should be added before, “[You] fear Adonoy.” (@ITRe”m@it).<QC>
@p1[2]@p2<TIE>Do not hold them in esteem, etc.@bo This interpretation is problematic, for it should say  @hh<HEB>תחנן@it<ENG> with the letter @ITnun@it, which is the term for esteem. Alternatively, it should say @hh<HEB>תחונם@it<ENG>, spelled with a @ITvov@it. Therefore Rashi says, “Another interpretation: Do not give them an encampment.” In other words: Even if you do not make a treaty, but think to [let them live with you and] tax them. Therefore it says not to give them any settlement at all in the Land. The second explanation is problematic, for then the verse should only state not to give them any settlement in the Land (@hh<HEB>לא תחנם@it<ENG>), and all the more so [we would know that] it is forbidden to make a treaty with them. Therefore the first explanation is also needed. @p1[4]@p2<TIE>Who is born of a gentile, is considered your son, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: The verse, “For he will turn your son,” seems to be giving a reason for the previous verse. But for what is it giving a reason? It cannot refer to the beginning of the verse, “Do not give your daughter to his son,” for then it should say, “For he will turn your @ITdaughter@it, etc.” And it cannot refer to the end of the verse, which is the simple understanding: “Nor take his daughter for your son,” and this is why it is written, “will turn @ITyour son@it.” This cannot be true, for it is written, “For @IThe@it will turn, etc,” but it should say in the feminine form, “For @ITshe@it will turn.” Rather, if the son of the gentile, etc. In other words: For he will turn him away from Me, but your son’s son born of a gentile woman is not considered your son. For this reason the Torah is not concerned with him, because he is already turned away.<QC>
@p1[8]@p2<TIE>On account of His keeping the oath.@bo This prefix @ITmem@it is not in place of the word @hh<HEB>מן@it<ENG> (from), which is usual in most instances. Rather it should be interpreted as, “because.”<QC>
@p1[9]@p2<TIE>But below it states: “For @BIthousands @BOof generations,” etc.@bo In other words: Those who keep His commandments out of fear [are rewarded] for a thousand generations, and those who do so out of love [are rewarded] for two thousand generations. Even though it is also written here, “those who love Him,” before, “those who keep His commandments,” One may say: “Those who love Him” is connected to the previous phrase, “Who keeps the covenant and the kindliness.” And, “Those who keep,” is connected to the phrase written afterwards. Likewise above (5:10) it is written, “two thousand,” and it is also written, “for those who guard.” There also, the answer is similar: “For those who love,” is connected to the phrase preceding it, which is, “For two thousand.” And “For those who keep,” [are rewarded] for a thousand generations.<QC>
@p1[10]@p2<TIE>During his lifetime He rewards him for his good deeds, etc.@bo Otherwise, this verse is self-contradictory: First it says that He rewards even His enemies for their good deeds, but afterwards it is written, “to destroy him.” @p1[11]@p2<TIE>And tomorrow in the World to Come, etc.@bo Rashi is explaining that the word, “today,” is connected to the word [following], “to fulfill,” not to the preceding [phrase], “I am commanding you,” for the commandment was not given  today.<QC>
@p1[12]@p2<TIE>If, even the lesser commandments, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Why is it written @hh<HEB>עקב@it<ENG>, which means “because of,” and implies they will definitely heed these laws, as we find regarding Avraham. There it is written (Bereishis 26:5), “Because (@hh<HEB>עקב@it<ENG>) you have heeded My voice etc,” and Avraham definitely listened to His voice and wished to slaughter his son. If so, here also it implies they will definitely listen. But it says (Megillah 25a), “Everything is in the hands of Heaven except for the fear of Heaven.” Therefore Rashi explains that @hh<HEB>עקב@it<ENG> means [“heel,” referring to] the lesser commandments (i.e., those commandments that people do not regard as being worth much reward). Therefore Rashi also says, “@ITIf@it, even the lesser commandments,” meaning, it is not definite. Additionally, because @hh<HEB>משפטים@it<ENG> here refers to @ITall@it the commandments and not just to monetary matters — since monetary matters are not mentioned here — then how can the verse say @hh<HEB>האלה@it<ENG> (these)? Therefore, Rashi changes [the meaning of] the word @hh<HEB>משפטים@it<ENG> [usually referring to monetary laws] to @hh<HEB>מצות@it<ENG> [commandments, in general]. (@ITRe”m@it). Another explanation is that Rashi is answering the question: The verse should say, “If you will heed the commandments,” as it is written in Parshas Ki Savo (below 28:1), “If you will heed,” and (ibid v. 15), “If you will not heed.” Therefore it is written @hh<HEB>עקב@it<ENG>, to imply “the lesser commandments etc.” @d1He will keep His promise to you.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Scripture writes @hh<HEB>ושמר@it<ENG>, which implies that Hashem will fulfill His oath. But, why should He not fulfill His oath? Therefore, Rashi explains: He will keep His promise to you. Additionally, Rashi says the word @hh<HEB>ישמור@it<ENG> (He will keep) instead of @hh<HEB>ושמר@it<ENG>. This shows that the prefix @ITvav@it does not mean “and,” rather, the @ITvav@it reverses the past tense to the future tense. @p1[13]@p2<TIE>Which the female casts out from her womb.@bo I.e., the offspring are called @hh<HEB>שגר@it<ENG>, related to the term “cast out.” And @hh<HEB>והבקרים אלפים@it<ENG> is related to, “Our cattle (@hh<HEB>אלופנו@it<ENG>) are laden (Tehillim 144:14).” @d1The strong bulls of Bashan means the choicest of the flock, etc.@bo I.e., Bashan is the name of a place. And there they have the choicest of the flock, i.e., healthy and strong. Therefore the flocks are called @hh<HEB>עשתרת@it<ENG>, which is an expression of strength. @d1Similar to @HB<HEB>עשתרת קרנים@BO<ENG> which expresses strength, etc.@bo Even though @hh<HEB>קרנים@it<ENG> is not written here, but since we find elsewhere in Scripture that @hh<HEB>עשתרת@it<ENG> [ — written with @hh<HEB>קרנים@it<ENG> — clearly] is an expression of strength. [Therefore] every instance where it is written @hh<HEB>עשתרות@it<ENG> it is explained as “strength,” even though @hh<HEB>קרנים@it<ENG> is not written. @d1Our Sages said: “Why are they called @HB<HEB>עשתרות@BO<ENG>, etc.@bo Our Sages do not disagree with Menachem’s explanation, for they also hold that @hh<HEB>עשתרות@it<ENG> expresses strength. Otherwise, our Sages will be contradicting themselves. For in Parshas Ki Savo (below 28:4), regarding @hh<HEB>עשתרות צאנך@it<ENG> Rashi explains: “As Onkelos translates. And our Sages said, ‘Why are they called @hh<HEB>עשתרות@it<ENG>? Because they enrich their owners and strengthen them, like these @hh<HEB>עשתרות@it<ENG> which are mighty cliffs.’” This indicates that our Sages also hold that @hh<HEB>עשתרות@it<ENG> is an expression of strength, just as Menachem. Rather, they disagree on this point: Menachem explains that @hh<HEB>עשתרות@it<ENG> refers to the [condition of the] flocks, but our Sages explain that it refers to [the condition of] their owners. @ITRe”m@it explains similarly below (ibid). @p1[18]@p2<TIE>And it is impossible to explain [the word @HB<HEB>כי@BO<ENG>] according to any other meanings of, etc.@bo In other words, the word @hh<HEB>כי@it<ENG> cannot mean, “because,” or, “rather,” for these terms cannot begin an idea. The word @hh<HEB>כי@it<ENG> also cannot mean, “if,” for it is not possible to say, “If you will say [i.e., think] this, then do not think it.” For if you have already thought it, it is not possible to say that you should not think it. Furthermore, [if the word @hh<HEB>כי@it<ENG> means “if”] then the verse would imply: If you think… then do not fear them. But if you do not think… then fear them. But this is not correct. Rashi explains in this manner in Gittin (90a). @p1[19]@p2<TIE>This refers to the pestilence.@bo As it is written (Shmos 9:3), “Behold the hand of Adonoy is directed at your livestock, etc.” @d1This is a reference to the sword of the plague of (the Egyptian) first born.@bo As it is written, “And his [the angel’s] sword was drawn in his extended arm upon Yerushalayim (Divrei Hayomim I 21:16).” Some explain this verse simply — that it refers to the sword Hashem had used to smite the first born. Others explain that the first born smote their fathers. For the first born knew they would be smitten because of the Jewish People, so they told their fathers to expel them from Egypt. Their fathers did not listen, so they [fought against their fathers and] killed thousands of them. And this is stated in the verse, “Who smote Egypt through their first born (Tehillim 136:10).” (@ITKolbo@it and @ITAvudrohom@it). @p1[22]@p2<TIE>But is it not true that if they do the will of the Omnipresent, etc.@bo Above in Parshas Mishpatim (Shmos 23:29) I explained why Rashi did not say this reason.<QC>
@p1[1]@p2<TIE>This can be understood in its plain sense.@bo I.e., the word @hh<HEB>מצוה@it<ENG> (lit., commandment) refers to a [whole] category, as if it said, “all the commandments.” @d1There is also a Midrashic explanation: If you began to fulfill a @BImitzvah@BO, complete it, etc.@bo I.e., the word @hh<HEB>כל@it<ENG> is related to the word, “And Hashem @ITcompleted@it (@hh<HEB>ויכל@it<ENG>) on the seventh day, etc. (Bereishis 2:2).” Alternatively, the word @hh<HEB>כל@it<ENG> is related to the word @hh<HEB>כלה@it<ENG> (entire). In other words, you should perform the @ITmitzvah@it in its entirety — if you begin to fulfill it, complete it. According to this, the word @hh<HEB>מצוה@it<ENG> written in this verse refers to “a single commandment.”<QC>
@p1[2]@p2<TIE>Not to test Him and not to be critical of Him.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Just because Hashem oppresses them will they guard His commandments? [Therefore] Rashi explains the verse as, “Adonoy oppressed them in order to know… will you guard His commandments.” I.e., that you are not to test Him, etc. It is at if the verse says: .<TIE>.<TIE>.to know if you will be critical of Him @ITafter He oppresses you@it and say, “Why do I need His commandments?” @p1[4]@p2<TIE>As they grew, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: What is this verse teaching us, that by storing their garments in a chest they did not wear out? Rashi explains: Even though their garments were on them [i.e., they were worn] for forty years, they did not wear out. And the reason for this is because the clouds of Divine Glory, etc. This is the significance of @hh<HEB>מעליך@it<ENG> (on you). I.e., even though they wore the garments. @d1This usually happens to those who walk barefoot, etc.@bo You might ask: It says in Parshas Ki Savo (below 29:4), “and your shoe did not shred from your foot,” which implies that they wore shoes! The answer is: That verse there refers to the Jews who left Egypt who had shoes — those shoes did not shred. Rashi’s explanation here refers to the Jews who were born in the wilderness who did not have shoes. However @ITRe”m@it explains that, “This usually happens to those who walk barefoot,” is only describing the type of swelling, but they were not actually barefoot, etc. And according to this explanation, one should not ask: What is the significance of “nor did your foot swell”? Since they did not walk barefoot, is this not obvious? The answer is: Indeed this is so. The verse teaches us that their shoes did not shred from their feet. It should be understood as follows: Your foot did not swell (which usually happens to those who walk barefoot); and this is because you did not have to walk barefoot, since your shoes did not shred. @p1[8]@p2<TIE>Olives that produce oil.@bo I.e., there are two species of olives, and one of them does not produce oil. Therefore it needed to write, “oil-olives.” Alternatively, [Rashi’s explanation is] because we say that the Land of Israel is praised for seven items. But if you count, “olive,” and, “oil,” separately, then you will find eight items. Therefore Rashi explains: “Olives that produce oil.” I.e., it is only @ITone@it item.<QC>
@p1[1]@p2<TIE>You are powerful, etc.@bo Otherwise why does it say, “than you”? It would suffice to say, “to come inherit nations great and powerful.”<QC>
@p1[4]@p2<TIE>My righteousness and the wickedness of the nations was the cause.@bo Rashi is answering the question: In the beginning of the verse it is written, “Do not think .<TIE>.<TIE>. Because of my righteousness and because of the wickedness of these nations, etc.,” which implies that neither of these reasons caused the Jewish People to inherit. Yet afterwards it is written, “Not because of your righteousness .<TIE>.<TIE>. rather because of the wickedness of these nations, etc.”! Therefore, Rashi explains the verse as follows: The beginning of the verse, “Do not think .<TIE>.<TIE>. Because of my righteousness @ITand@it because of the wickedness of these nations was the cause,” means not to think that both reasons were the cause. “Rather the wickedness of these nations,” alone, caused them to be expelled. Then the land was abandoned, and the first to come could take possession of it. Since you are the first to come, you could take possession of it. [You might ask:] the verse above says, “Rather, out of Adonoy’s love for you and out of His keeping the oath (7:8),” and Adonoy’s love only applies to those who keep his commandments [therefore they should deserve to inherit the land in their own right]! @ITRamban@it has already explained [the answer]: The verse above refers to the Jewish People in general [throughout history], but here he is rebuking the generation that rebelled against Hashem.<QC>
@p1[9]@p2<TIE>In this sense, the word @HB<HEB>ישיבה@BO<ENG> means remaining.@bo I.e., the expression @hh<HEB>ישיבה@it<ENG> stated here means, “remaining.” Otherwise there is a difficulty from a verse written later (10:10), “I stood on the mountain.”<QC>
@p1[18]@p2<TIE>As it is said, “I will now ascend to Adonoy, etc.”@bo Rashi is explaining: You should not say that Moshe ascended at this time to receive the second Tablets after which he descended on Yom Kippur. For below it is written (10:1), “At that time, Adonoy said to me, ‘Hew for yourself, etc.,’” and Rashi explains there, “At the end of forty days He granted me favor,” which is referring to the same forty days written here. This implies that he did not ascend here in order to accept the second Tablets. Therefore Rashi explains: These forty days are the middle ones when Moshe ascended to pray (for forgiveness), as it says (Shmos 32:30), “I will now ascend, etc.” @d1As he ascended on the eighteenth of Tammuz, etc.@bo See what I wrote above in Parshas Ki Sisa (Shmos 33:11). @d1That day, the Hashem, granted favor to the Israelites joyfully etc@bo. However, on the first day of Elul, Hashem granted favor only regarding the Tablets, but not regarding the golden calf. But on Yom Kippur Hashem said, “I have forgiven, just as you spoke,” which also refers to the golden calf. Therefore, Yom Kippur was designated for atonement and forgiveness rather than the first day of Elul when Hashem showed favor and said, “Carve two stones for yourself.” Rashi’s question, “From where is it derived that He granted complete favor?” means to say: From where is it derived that the second Tablets were given with favor? [Perhaps they were given] out of necessity, for the Jewish People already had accepted the yoke of Torah and mitzvos and entered the covenant, which would be impossible for them to keep [without receiving] the Torah and mitzvos, etc. (@ITRe”m@it) @d1And said to Moshe, ‘I have forgiven, just as you spoke,’ etc.@bo @ITChizkuni@it explains as follows: Rashi’s commentary, “I have forgiven, just as you spoke,” is not quoting the verse written in Parshas Shelach Lecha (Bamidbar 14:20) regarding the spies. Rather, it is Rashi’s own explanation. For note that the Jewish People made the calf on the seventeenth of Tamuz right after leaving Egypt, and the spies were not sent until the twenty-ninth of Sivan of the second year [after leaving Egypt]. This seems so also from Rashi’s words. For note in Parshas Ki Sisa (Shmos 33:11) Rashi did not quote the verse, “I have forgiven, @ITjust as you spoke@it.” Instead he writes there, “On the tenth of Tishrei Hashem granted favor to the Israelites joyfully and wholeheartedly and He said to Moshe, ‘I have forgiven,’ and then He gave him, etc.” @d1From where is it derived that He granted complete favor?, etc.@bo For it is possible to think: “Carve for yourself,” was only out of necessity. For the Jewish People already accepted the yoke of Torah and had converted, and it was impossible for them to retract. Therefore, [you could think that] Hashem did not grant them complete favor until Yom Kippur. And Rashi adds, “You may thus say that the interim days, etc,” only for the sake of completing the thought. @p1[20]@p2<TIE>Because he listened to you.@bo I.e., but not because he [i.e., Aharon] sinned. @d1This refers to the death of children, etc.@bo Rashi infers this because it is written @hh<HEB>להשמידו@it<ENG> rather than @hh<HEB>להשמיד אותו@it<ENG> as it says above (v. 19) @hh<HEB>להשמיד אתכם@it<ENG>. Therefore [the lack of the word @hh<HEB>אותי@it<ENG> indicates] it is not referring specifically to Aharon. Rather, it must be referring to his children. @d1My prayer was effective in atoning for half, etc.@bo I.e., the word @hh<HEB>גם@it<ENG> (also) includes Aharon’s sons. @d1Two died and two were spared.@bo Their death was caused by a combination of reasons: For this [the golden calf], and for staring brazenly [at the Divine Presence] when the Torah was given, while engaged in eating and drinking. See Parshas Mishpatim (Shmos 24:11), and Parshas Shemini (Vayikra 10:2). @p1[1]@p2<TIE>And Betzalel made the Tabernacle first, etc.@bo I.e., do not say that they certainly were not commanded to make the Tabernacle until after Yom Kippur, but Betzalel made the ark first and afterward the Tabernacle. And if so, this ark (mentioned here) could be the ark that Betzalel made. Therefore, Rashi explains, “And Betzalel made the Tabernacle first, etc.”<QC>
@p1[6]@p2<TIE>You will discover that there were eight journeys, etc.@bo Yet Rashi comments in Parshas Chukas (Bamidbar 21:4) that there were @ITseven@it journeys from Moseiroh to Mount Hor. This [seeming contradiction] is clarified in the beginning of Parshas Masei (ibid. 33:1). [Here, as in Parshas Masei, Rashi is counting the number of places and in Parshas Chukas Rashi is counting the journeys from one place to another].<QC>
@p1[8]@p2<TIE>And the Levites did not transgress, the Omnipresent separated them from you.@bo [One might ask:] It is written, “the Omnipresent separated them,” but they were not separated until the second year when the Mishkon was erected! We must say that the Omnipresent separated them in @ITthought@it. Perforce, “Adonoy separated the tribe of Leivi,” must be explained in this manner [instead of saying that it refers to the second year when they were @ITactually@it separated] because it is written afterwards (v. 10), “And I stood on the mountain,” which also refers to, “At that time,” which was in the first year, after the sin of the calf. According to this we can understand why Rashi does not explain this verse in the same order it is written in the Torah [I.e., “the Omnipresent separated,” is juxtaposed with their retreat to Bnei Ya’akon to teach us something; not because it happened after their retreat]. @d1The Levites.@bo Rashi is answering the question: From the verse, “Adonoy separated, etc.,” it seems that the Levites also bless in His Name, but this is not so! Therefore Rashi explains that, “to carry the ark,” pertains to the Levites, and, “to stand… and to serve Him and bless in His Name,” pertains to the @ITkohanim@it. @p1[9]@p2<TIE>Because they were separated for service at the altar, etc.@bo I.e., it is not because they were separated to serve Adonoy that they had no share, as might be understood from the verse. For on the contrary, it would be fitting to increase their benefits, not to diminish them.<QC>
@d1He receives his allotted portion, etc.@bo His portion is the gifts of @ITterumos@it and @ITma’aseros@it (tithes). The phrase, “Adonoy is his heritage,” is in response to, “Leivi had no share or territory with his brothers.” Their sustenance must be provided in another way in lieu of receiving a share or land. And, “Adonoy is his heritage,” must be explained as referring to Leivi’s allotted portion, which is the gifts of @ITterumos@it and @ITma’aseros@it. Rashi says, “provided readily,” to indicate that Leivi’s portion [of @ITterumos@it and @ITma’aseros@it] was given to them, in lieu of [a portion in the] land that was given to the Israelites, because it is readily available without effort. And [as a result] they do not need to toil, to the point they would refrain from service at the altar [when they will need to toil]. @p1[10]@p2<TIE>With the first tablets, etc.@bo This ended on the seventeenth of Tammuz, not on the twenty-eighth of Av. The comparison of the last forty days to the first ones is not to indicate that they too were with complete favor just as the first ones, for this is not true. The first ones were with complete favor — as they had not yet sinned with the calf, while the last ones were only with favor regarding the giving of the Tablets [Moshe was told “carve for yourself,” before they started]. But forgiveness for the calf was only granted on the last of [these last] forty days, which was on Yom Kippur. For then Hashem said, “I have forgiven just as you spoke.” Therefore, that day was designated for atonement and forgiveness. The comparison is only informing us that the forty days stated here, “And I stood on the mountain,” are not referring to the middle forty days [i.e., Moshe was not on the mountain only for 80 days]. Rather they are an additional forty days, which were with favor and not with anger. From this we derive that Moshe stood on the mountain for 120 days. @p1[11]@p2<TIE>Although you turned away from Him, etc.@bo Otherwise why is this verse mentioned during [Moshe’s] words of rebuke?<QC>
@p1[12]@p2<TIE>All things are in the hands of Heaven, etc.@bo I.e., this verse is not connected to the previous verses. Rather it begins a new topic to teach us that all things are in the hands of Heaven aside from, etc. Therefore He only asks of you to fear Him — which consists of similar activities that a person may choose to do or he may choose not to do, and it includes the fear of Heaven (@ITRe”m@it). @p1[13]@p2<TIE>And this is also not for naught, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: At the beginning of the verse it says, “To guard Adonoy’s commandments,” meaning, “for Hashem’s benefit.” But at the end of the verse it is written, “For @ITyour@it benefit,” meaning, “for the benefit of the Jewish People.” Therefore Rashi explains: “And this is also, etc.” In other words: Certainly you should keep the commandments for His benefit. But nonetheless, for you too this is not for naught, but for your benefit. @p1[14]@p2<TIE>All things, etc.@bo This refers to all that is written in the verse, “The heavens and the heavens beyond the heavens, the earth, etc.” @p1[15]@p2<TIE>Just as you see yourselves desired, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Why is the word @hh<HEB>בכם@it<ENG> (you) needed? The verse only needed to say, “He chose their descendants after them from all, etc.” Therefore Rashi explains: “Just as you see yourselves desired, etc.” In other words, “In yourselves you can see that Hashem chose you and your descendants, for you see yourselves desired above all nations.” And Rashi says @hh<HEB>היום הזה@it<ENG> (this day) instead of @hh<HEB>כיום הזה@it<ENG> (like this day), because he explains the word @hh<HEB>בכם@it<ENG> (you) literally, and they [who, “you,” is referring to] were actually present “this day.” The prefix @hh<HEB>כ@it<ENG> (like) is not disregarded, for it is connected to, “He chose their descendants after them.” As if it says, “And He chose their descendants after them, like this day, from all the peoples.” @p1[16]@p2<TIE>Your heart’s obstruction — its covering].@bo “Its covering” is what is meant by “its obstruction.” Rashi writes likewise in Parshas Va’eira (Shmos 6:12). @p1[17]@p2<TIE>No lord is capable, etc.@bo Otherwise it should say, “For Adonoy is God and Lord.” Furthermore, since He is God over all gods, then certainly He is Lord over all lords. Rather, [“Lord over lords” means that no lord], etc. @d1If you cast off His yoke.@bo “Exercising favoritism,” generally means either to acquit one who is guilty, or to forgo his punishment. So too, “accepting a bribe” [is for either of these two reasons]. “Acquitting the guilty,” cannot be attributed to Hashem, but, “forgoing punishment,” can be. Perforce, “exercises favoritism” means, “forgo punishment.” Rashi says that if you cast off His yoke then He will not exercise favoritism, meaning He will not forgo your punishment. Similarly, “Nor accepts bribes, etc.,” means for the sake of forgoing your punishment, as is usual for those who accepts bribes. The verse mentions both because punishment is sometimes forgone because of favoritism, and sometimes because of bribery. @ITRe”m@it writes: I do not know how monetary gifts [i.e., bribes] can be associated to Hashem. Why does Rashi not explain, “Nor accepts a bribe — of a @ITmitzvah @itin exchange for a sin. I.e., He does not forgo punishment for a person’s sin in exchange for a @ITmitzvah@it that he did. Rather He gives reward for the @ITmitzvah@it [that he did] and punishment for his sin.” @ITRe”m@it leaves this question unresolved. @p1[18]@p2<TIE>This expresses power, etc.@bo I.e., the previous verse, “For Adonoy, your God, is God over judges etc.,” expresses power. Therefore juxtaposed to it is, “Who performs justice for orphan and widow etc.” This is to inform us of His humility, that He performs justice for those who are weak and helpless. @d1This is a significant matter, etc.@bo I.e., do not think that it is a small matter to provide the convert with bread and a garment. [And do not think] it seems from here that He is incapable of [providing] more, for it is written above, “Who performs justice for orphan and widow,” which expresses power. @p1[19]@p2<TIE>With your own blemish do not taunt your fellow.@bo I.e., this verse is as if it says, “You are to love the convert, @ITand do not insult him@it.” And this is why it says afterwards, “Because @ITyou@it were strangers,” [which implies that] with your own blemish, etc. But “love” alone, means to act kindly towards him, and is not connected to, “because you were strangers.” For having been strangers does not obligate you to act kindly towards a stranger. Rashi explains likewise in Parshas Mishpatim (Shmos 22:20). See also Bava Metzia 59b. @p1[20]@p2<TIE>After having acquired all of these attributes then swear in His Name.@bo Rashi clarifies several matters. He writes @hh<HEB>ותעבוד@it<ENG> (and serve) instead of @hh<HEB>אותו תעבוד@it<ENG> (serve @ITHim@it). For the word @hh<HEB>אותו@it<ENG> is not necessary; instead the verse should say @hh<HEB>תירא ותעבוד@it<ENG> (fear and serve.) Also Rashi writes @hh<HEB>ותדבק בו@it<ENG> (@ITand cling@it to Him) instead of @hh<HEB>ובו תדבק@it<ENG> (and to Him, cling), in order that all the verbs should follow one another [i.e., they should be grouped together] — “Fear, serve, and cling.” Also, by adding the word @hh<HEB>אז@it<ENG> (then) Rashi indicates that, “Swear by His Name,” is not a positive commandment, as [might be] understood from the verse. And [Rashi writes @hh<HEB>בשמו@it<ENG> to indicate] the @hh<HEB>ו@it<ENG> of @hh<HEB>ובשמו@it<ENG> is superfluous. [The meaning of the verse is] as if the word @hh<HEB>אם@hh@ee<ENG> (if) is added and the verse said, “@ITIf@it you fear, serve, and cling to Him, then swear.” I.e., then you are permitted to swear, but not that it is a commandment to swear, as [might be] understood from the verse. @p1[2]@p2<TIE>Pay close attention so that you know and understand, etc.@bo [“You will know today,”] does not mean that they will know something new today. For he told them nothing new here.<QC>
@d1That I now speak, etc.@bo For the word @hh<HEB>את@it<ENG> [here] means the same as @hh<HEB>עם@it<ENG> (with). Rashi adds, “That I now speak,” for without adding “That I now speak” the [meaning of the] verse cannot be understood. Therefore he needed to explain the word @hh<HEB>את@it<ENG> means “with,” for the word @hh<HEB>עם@it<ENG> applies only to one who is being spoken to. Also Rashi adds the word “now,” for without it the verse means that He would never speak with any of their offspring, only with these alone.<QC>
@p1[6]@p2<TIE>The ground sloped, funnel-like, etc.@bo Rashi does not explain the verse in the order that it is written. [He explains “Amid all of Israel,” before explaining, “And all the sustenance, etc.”]@BO@bo The reason is: “Amid, etc.” also refers to, “You will know (v. 2).” [I.e.,] it is fitting to accept my reprimand since you witnessed all the signs He performed in Egypt, and what He did for you in the wilderness, and what He did for you when Dosson and Avirom were swallowed up amid all of Israel — the ground sloped (funnel-like), and no one from Israel fell in even if he were standing next to him, and this was a great miracle.<QC>
@p1[7]@p2<TIE>For it is not with your children, etc.@bo The first @hh<HEB>כי@it<ENG> (v. 2) in the verse means “for,” and the second @hh<HEB>כי@it<ENG> means “rather.” As if it says, “Pay close attention so that you know and understand my reprimand, for it is not with your children that I now speak, etc.,” as Rashi explained above. “But rather with you… I am speaking.” And since it is not [grammatically] correct to say, “Rather with you, eyes have witnessed,” Rashi adds the words @hh<HEB>אשר@it<ENG> (whose) before “eyes.”<QC>
@p1[10]@p2<TIE>This assurance was made to the Israelites [when they departed from Egypt], etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Why is Egypt be mentioned here more than any other land? Rashi explains: This assurance, etc. @d1But perhaps Scripture speaks derogatorily, etc.@bo Why should Moshe intend to speak derogatorily of Eretz Yisroel, God forbid? Were the spies not smitten for speaking derogatorily of Eretz Yisroel? Furthermore, how would we explain the verse following, “Rather, the Land where you are crossing to inherit [is a land of mountains and plains — ] by the rain of the skies will you drink water,” which is praising the Land? It seems that Rashi means to say, “But perhaps, etc.” i.e., even though Eretz Yisroel was superior to all other lands, including Mitzrayim, nevertheless Mitzrayim is superior on account that it grows crops perpetually, since it is constantly irrigated. But the Land that you are entering cannot be irrigated because it is a mountainous region. Furthermore, it needs to be irrigated many times, because the water flows down the mountain and does not saturate the land. Therefore, Eretz Yisroel does not grow crops naturally, but rather through Divine providence — supernaturally. This [statement] is praise to Eretz Yisroel that it is sustained by miracles, even though by natural means it is not as good as Mitzrayim. Therefore Rashi says, “But perhaps Scripture speaks derogatorily.” In other words, by describing its inferiority, the Land’s praiseworthiness is revealed. @d1The Torah therefore teaches, “Chevron was built seven years [before]<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”, etc.@bo I.e., Chevron was built seven years before Tzoan. @d1In Kesubos (112a) this is expounded differently, etc.@bo [Regarding the verse, @hh<HEB>חברון שבע שנים נבנתה לפני וכו'@it<ENG>] In the first explanation [here] each word is understood literally: @hh<HEB>שנים@it<ENG> means “years,” @hh<HEB>נבנתה@it<ENG> means “a physical building,” and @hh<HEB>לפני@it<ENG> means “before (earlier in time).” But according to the explanation in Kesubos: The word @hh<HEB>שנים@it<ENG> means @hh<HEB>שונים@it<ENG> (times), and @hh<HEB>נבנתה@it<ENG> is related to the term, “And I @ITwill be built@it also from her (Bereishis 30:3),” an expression referring to producing offspring. And @hh<HEB>לפני@it<ENG> means, “preceding (superior)”. @d1Rather, it was built up seven times more than Tzoan.@bo The word @hh<HEB>מבונה@it<ENG> means “producing offspring,” as in the verse, “And I will be built also from her (ibid.),” as Rashi explains in Kesubos (112a). I.e., One portion of land in Chevron produces a crop that is equal to [the produce yielded by] seven portions [of land] in Tzoan. @d1Even the land of Raamses, etc.@bo Otherwise why does it need to say, “From which you departed”?<QC>
@p1[12]@p2<TIE>To see what its needs are, etc.@bo Otherwise what is the meaning of, “Until the year’s end”? For whatever is decreed on Rosh Hashanah will be carried out throughout the year! Furthermore it would be enough to write, “The eyes of Adonoy, your God [are always upon it].” Rather, [“From the year’s beginning, etc.” means] to modify the decrees that were decided on Rosh Hashanah according to what the people deserve. But it seems to me that Rashi is expounding from the word “always,” which implies that Hashem is constantly watching over the Land to initiate [decrees] according to its needs. The same inference is made in Maseches Rosh Hashanah 17b. (@ITGur Aryeh@it). @d1As stated in tractate Rosh Hashanah.@bo If the Jewish People are wicked on Rosh Hashanah then He will decree scarce rainfall that year. [Even] if they repent during that year then He will not increase [the rainfall], for the decree was already made. Instead, He brings that scarce amount of rain upon the fields rather than upon the wilderness and other places that do not require rainfall. Also He brings the rain in its proper time. The converse is also true — if the Jewish People are meritorious on Rosh Hashanah, etc. @p1[13]@p2<TIE>By the rain of the skies you will drink water.@bo For if you heed, then “I will provide the rain of your land.” But if not then, “He will restrain the skies, etc.” @d1If you heed the old, etc.@bo I.e., if you review what you already learned, then you will gain wisdom from it and understand new matters from the old. Rashi explains likewise in Succah (46b). Even though regarding [the seeming redundancy] @hh<HEB>הענק תענק@it<ENG> (surely bestow a gift) we say that the Torah uses common speech, we expound the verse whenever we are able to (@ITRe”m@it). Alternatively, here the word @hh<HEB>והיה@it<ENG> (lit., it will be) is an expression of certainty, whereas the word @hh<HEB>אם@it<ENG> (if) is an expression of doubt. Therefore, the verse is expounded. @d1This is as it is written in the scroll, etc.@bo I.e., @ITMegilas Storim@it, but it is not a verse found in any of the twenty-four books of Scripture. And in the Talmud Yerushalmi, an allegory is mentioned of two people taking leave of each other. One travels a day’s journey eastward, and the other travels a day’s journey westward. They will find themselves distanced from each other by a two days’ journey. The same is true about the Torah. @d1As if you heard them this very day.@bo Otherwise why is, “today,” needed? @d1Rather, all that you fulfill, fulfill with love, etc.@bo The word @hh<HEB>לאהבה@it<ENG> (to love) should be understood as @hh<HEB>לאהבת ה'@it<ENG> (for the love of Adonoy). It then follows that, @hh<HEB>"@it<ENG>And to serve Him,@hh<HEB>"@it<ENG> is [also directly] connected to, “Should you thoroughly heed My commandments.” [According to this] it would be fitting for the verse to say @hh<HEB>ולעבדני@it<ENG> (and to serve Me), except this is only a general exegesis. @d1One command is addressed to the individual, etc.@bo I.e., if only one verse were written then we would think it addresses the community as a whole, but not the individual. Even though it is written, “With all @ITyour@it (singular) heart, and with all @ITyour@it (singular) soul,” we would think it is common for Scripture to use the singular when referring to the community, as in the verse, “Listen (singular) O Israel!” You might ask: Why is the individual warned here more than in other commandments, although there is no difference [here] between the individual and the community? The answer is: Regarding this commandment, the verse states many benefits which Hashem will do for fulfilling it: Harvesting grain, wine, olive oil, grass for animals, etc. Therefore I would have thought it is intended specifically for the community but not for the individual, thus the individual also needs to be included. And it teaches us that when the commandments are fulfilled out of love by individuals, He will also perform all these miracles for them (@ITRamban@it). And since this commandment addresses the community, it fits well that is not written here, “and with all your possessions,” as it is written above. For it is unlikely that the majority of the community would consider money more precious than life. However, this may be true of an individual (@ITMahara”i@it). @p1[14]@p2<TIE>You fulfill your obligation, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Why does it say regarding this commandment there is so much reward, “I will provide the rain of your land in its time, fall rain and spring rain, etc.”? Yet above in Parshas Bechukosai (Vayikra 26:4) Scripture only writes, “I will provide your rain in their proper time”! Rashi answers: You fulfill your obligation, etc. In other words, you shall fulfill your obligation and you need not do more than this — to keep My commandments out of love. As it is written, “To love Adonoy .<TIE>.<TIE>. and to serve Him, etc.” therefore I shall fulfill my obligation and pay you abundant reward. (@ITRe”m@it). @d1On Shabbos eve, etc.@bo Rashi [only] says, “On Shabbos eve,” but the Gemora (Taanis 23a) says, “On Shabbos eves and on the eves of the fourth weekday [Tuesday night],” because harmful forces reign on these two nights. The answer is: Rashi’s explanation is based on nowadays when these harmful forces are not common. Therefore, he only mentions, “On Shabbos eve.” Now it fits well that Rashi explains, “When everyone is at home,” rather than, “Because of harmful forces.” Rashi’s first explanation is problematic, for the verse should say @hh<HEB>בעתותם@it<ENG> (in its @ITtimes@it), since all nights are included. Therefore, Rashi says, “Another interpretation, etc.” But the other explanation is problematic, for it applies when harmful forces are common. However, when they are not common such as nowadays, then what is the meaning of “in its time” written in the verse? Therefore Rashi also says the first explanation. @d1Because it descends on the ears and on the stalks.@bo I.e., the word @hh<HEB>מלקוש@it<ENG> is a contraction of @hh<HEB>מלילות קשין@it<ENG>. This explanation by itself is problematic, for the verse should say @hh<HEB>ומלילות@it<ENG> (ears). Therefore, the first reason in needed. Yet the first reason is problematic, for the verse should say @hh<HEB>לקשיא@it<ENG> (late ones). Therefore the second reason is also needed. @d1You will gather it into your home, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: How is it a blessing that he must exert himself to work and harvest rather than having servants and maidservants? Rashi answers: You will gather, [implies @ITyou@it, but] not your enemies. @p1[15]@p2<TIE>So that it will not be necessary for you to lead it to the desert.@bo I.e., to the desert where there is pasture for the animals. Rather, grass for the animals will grow in your field. This is according to Rabbi Yehuda in the Sifrei. Rashi’s second interpretation, “You will reap, etc.” is according to Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai who explains that “Grass in your field,” refers to the grass [i.e., produce] of the field and not to pasture for the animals. And @hh<HEB>ולבהמתך@it<ENG> means, “@ITand@it @ITalso@it for your animals.” Because of its abundance you will reap it and feed it to your animals, and the remainder will be for human consumption. This is why Rashi offers both explanations. @d1This is a different blessing, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: How does, “And you will eat and be full” relate to the first part of the verse? Is a person sated because there is food for his animals? Rashi answers: This is not related to the first part of the verse, but rather this is a different blessing, etc. @p1[16]@p2<TIE>By abandoning the Torah, etc.@bo In Scripture, every instance of “turn away” means, “to turn away from what was commanded to be done,” referring to a positive commandment. It is written (below 11:28), “And you turn away from the course, etc.,” and not, from what you were commanded to refrain from doing. Therefore, perforce, “turn away,” [here] means, “To turn away from the Torah that you were commanded to toil in it,” and the result will be, “You serve other gods, etc.” From here our Sages say, “For once a man abandons the Torah, etc.” (@ITRe”m@it). @d1They are alien to those who worship them, etc.@bo See Rashi’s commentary in Parshas Yisro (Shmos 20:3). @p1[17]@p2<TIE>Even what you bring to it, etc.@bo Otherwise why is the word @hh<HEB>יבולה@it<ENG> (literally, “its produce”) necessary? For it is already written, “He will restrain the skies and there will be no rain.” It then follows that the soil will not yield its usual produce. @d1In addition to all the other suffering, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Just because there will be no rain and the soil will not yield its produce, is this why they will be swiftly removed? Therefore Rashi explains, “In addition, etc.” @d1Which caused you to sin, etc.@bo The difficulty is: Why is the word, “good” needed? Instead it should have said, “From upon your land,” or, “From upon the land that Adonoy is giving you.” Why should its goodness be mentioned in the curse? Furthermore, it already says, “And the soil will not yield its produce.” If so, the goodness of the land has (already) been taken away. Rather the word “good” means to say: Its goodness that it had in the past is what caused you to sin. Therefore, I will exile you from it. @d1But you may ask, was not an extension granted, etc.@bo You might ask: Was not an extension granted also to the Jewish People after they sinned? The answer is that Rashi is saying: As soon as the Jewish People’s measure of sin is full, He would immediately punish them. However, regarding the generation of the Flood, even though their measure was full, Hashem granted them a further extension. As it is written (Bereishis 6:3), “Adonoy said, ‘I will not judge… His days shall be a hundred and twenty years.” And Rashi comments [there], “Until 120 years I will extend my anger [i.e. be patient] with them, etc.” @d1[They] had no one from whom to learn, etc.@bo Yet Rashi explained in the end of Parshas Bereishis (ibid v. 4), “Although they witnessed the generation of Enosh being destroyed, for the oceans rose up and flooded a third of the world, yet the generation of the Flood did not humble themselves to take a lesson from them”! The answer is: They attributed it to natural causes since only a third of the world was flooded. @p1[18]@p2<TIE>Even after you are exiled, etc.@bo Otherwise why should this be mentioned in connection with their exile? One cannot say that, “You are to place, etc.” and everything [written] afterwards applies [only] during exile. For if so, why does it say afterwards, “In order that they will be many… on the soil”? It must be that they will return to the land and live for many years there. @p1[19]@p2<TIE>From the time that the son is able to speak, etc.@bo Otherwise Scripture should write, “And you are to teach them to your sons to learn them (@hh<HEB>ללמוד@it<ENG>).” Why does it say to, “To @ITspeak@it in them (@hh<HEB>לדבר בם@it<ENG>)”?<QC>
@p1[21]@p2<TIE>Thus, we discover the derivation of the revival of the dead, etc.@bo For the deceased themselves will rise and settle in the land. @p1[22]@p2<TIE>Rather, cling to the disciples and the sages, etc.@bo I.e., “Cling to Him,” cannot be interpreted as, “He is merciful — you should be merciful.” For the verse already has written, “To walk in all His ways,” which Rashi interprets as, “Just as He is merciful, etc.” Rather, “Cling to Him,” [here] must be expounded differently, as Rashi explains. This explanation answers the question: Why Rashi does not comment on the verse (10:20), “Cling to Him,” and also in Parshas Re’ey on the verse (below 13:5), “Cleave to Him”? [The answer is: Because neither verse says, “Walk in all His ways.”] @p1[23]@p2<TIE>You have fulfilled your obligations, etc.@bo The meaning of Rashi here is the same as I explained above (v. 14).<QC>
@p1[25]@p2<TIE>The Torah therefore teaches, “there will not stand up” — in any case, etc.@bo I.e., if Scripture had written “@hh<HEB>איש לא יתיצב@it<ENG> (A man will not stand up),” then we would understand it literally as, “a man.” Now that it is written@BO@bo @hh<HEB>לא יתיצב@it<ENG> and afterwards @hh<HEB>איש@it<ENG>, we interpret it as, “will not stand up — in any event.” And then it mentions, “a man,” to expound something different, as Rashi explains, “Even one like Og, king of Bashan.” Rashi explains this in Gittin (77a) regarding “@hh<HEB>ונתן בידה@it<ENG> (and he puts into her hand),” and also in other places [such as] in Chulin (88b) (@ITMahari”tz@it). Furthermore since it is written here, “Fear of you and awe of you… upon the surface of the entire land,” which means that the entire world will be afraid of you. Therefore, it is obvious that “there will not stand up” means “in any case.” If so, what is the meaning of, “a man”? Even one like Og, king of Bashan (@ITRe”m@it). Alternatively, Rashi is answering the question: Why is this matter repeated? For note that it says above (7:24), “no man will stand up to you, etc.” Rather it teaches us, “Even one like Og etc. @d1Even one like Og, king of Bashan.@bo In other words: The man whose being and strength is so amazing that he could stand up against all of you, as the Gemora (Brachos 54b) says that he uprooted a mountain, [even] he will not stand up against you.<QC>
@d1“Awe” denotes long term dread.@bo Although Rashi [already] explained that, “fear” refers to those who are nearby, etc, he is now explaining the difference why “fear” refers to those who are nearby and “awe” refers to those who are distant.<QC>
@p1[26]@p2<TIE>To be pronounced at Mount Gerizim, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: The curses have already been stated above in Parshas Bechukosai (Vayikra 26:14) and below in Parshas Ki Savo (Devarim 28:15) [but not here]! Rashi answers: “To be pronounced at Mount Gerizim, etc.” And “place” means, “to arrange before you today.” @p1[27]@p2<TIE>On condition that you listen.@bo Rashi is answering the question: The verse should have said @hh<HEB>אם תשמעו@it<ENG> (@ITif@it you heed), in the same manner as it is written afterwards, “And the curse — @ITif@it you do not heed.” For @hh<HEB>אשר@it<ENG> (@ITthat@it) implies that they will definitely obey the commandments. But this is not so, for everything is in the hands of Heaven besides the fear of Heaven (Berachos 33b), and so perhaps they may not obey. Therefore Rashi explains: “That you heed” means, “on condition etc.” Also, this [that @hh<HEB>אשר@it<ENG> and @hh<HEB>אם@it<ENG> are written together] explains why Rashi does not say that @hh<HEB>אשר@it<ENG> (that) means @hh<HEB>אם@it<ENG> (if), as he explains in Bereishis that the verse, “Any children that (@hh<HEB>אשר@it<ENG>) you will have (Bereishis 48:6),” means, “@ITif@it (@hh<HEB>אם@it<ENG>) you will have more.” For in that verse it is not written @hh<HEB>אם@it<ENG> (if). as it is written here, “And the curse — @ITif@it (@hh<HEB>אם@it<ENG>) you do not heed.” Therefore [regarding the blessing] Scripture should have written @hh<HEB>אם@it<ENG>, since it is the same matter. But the verse here changes and writes @hh<HEB>אם@it<ENG> regarding the curses, yet it uses the word — @hh<HEB>אשר@it<ENG> — regarding the blessings, perforce we need to explain that @hh<HEB>אשר@it<ENG> means, “on condition that you listen,” even though both words could mean “if.” Also, this [that @hh<HEB>אשר@it<ENG> and @hh<HEB>אם@it<ENG> are written together] answers the question posed by @ITRe”m@it: Why does Rashi explain that @hh<HEB>אשר@it<ENG> means, “on condition that, etc.,” instead of, “if,” since we find @hh<HEB>אם@it<ENG> in place of @hh<HEB>אשר@it<ENG> [i.e., these two words are interchangeable]? @p1[28]@p2<TIE>Has strayed from the entire course commanded to Yisroel.@bo The term @hh<HEB>הסרה@it<ENG> always means, “turning away completely,” similar to [the word “send” in the verse], “And Adonoy Elohim sent him out of the Garden of Eden (Bereishis 3:23),” despite that the word @hh<HEB>מן@it<ENG> (from) [usually] implies, “partially.” @d1From here it is derived that anyone who admits to idolatry, etc.@bo I.e., since “The course,” mentioned here refers to the entire Torah, and then afterwards it says, “To follow other gods,” we learn [from this juxtaposition] that anyone who admits to idolatry is [considered] as if he denies the entire Torah. @p1[29]@p2<TIE>As Targum [Onkelos] renders the blessers, etc.@bo I.e., the Levites who will bless the Jewish People. For if @hh<HEB>הברכה@it<ENG> refers literally to the blessing, then why is it written, “you shall place”? For a blessing is intangible [and cannot be placed]! Rather, it refers to the Levites. In other words, “Place @ITthe ones who will bless@it the Jewish People,” which refers to the Levites. Another explanation [why it does not refer to the blessing]: For if @hh<HEB>הברכה@it<ENG> refers literally to the blessing, then the @ITentire@it Jewish People should place the blessing on Mount Gerizim — which is not so. For in Parshas Ki Savo (below 27:12) [See Rashi and Sifsei Chachomim there] it says that only the Levites are to place the blessing. Rather, the commandment is for the entire Jewish People — they should place the Levites as the ones to bless, on Mount Gerizim. [According to this explanation] the reason is not because the word “place” does not apply to a blessing. For we find the verse (Vayikra 16:21), “And @ITplace@it them on the head of the goat,” which means “through speech.” (@ITRe”m@it). @d1Towards Mount Gerizim, etc.@bo For it is written in Parshas Ki Savo (below 27:12-13) that six tribes will stand on Mount Gerizim, and six on Mount Eival. If so, this indicates that the Jewish People stood on Mount Gerizim, and the Levites stood between the mountains. @d1They turned their faces and opened with the blessing, etc.@bo Even though the verse in Parshas Ki Savo only says, “Cursed is the man who makes a sculpture, etc.,” and it does not say, “Blessed is the man, etc.” Nevertheless, since it is written here, “The blessers,” we can infer that there was a blessing. And it is logical to assume that they began with the blessing first. @p1[30]@p2<TIE>This provides the landmarks.@bo Rashi is answering the question: The word @hh<HEB>הלא@it<ENG> usually implies a contradiction! For example, regarding Avraham and Sarah it is written (Bereishis 20:5): “Did he not (@hh<HEB>הלא@it<ENG>) say to me, ‘She is my sister’?” But here it cannot be explained to mean that there is a contradiction. We also cannot explain it as in the verse (above 3:11), “Is it not (@hh<HEB>הלא@it<ENG>) in Rabbas of the descendants of Ammon,” where it means to strengthen and reinforce his words. For here it is not applicable to reinforce his words, for it refers to the giving of the blessing and curse. [Therefore] Rashi answers: “This provides the landmarks,” and this is why it is written @hh<HEB>הלא@it<ENG> [as if it said “behold”]. @d1Far after the crossing of the Yardein, etc.@bo I.e., the word “after,” is connected to the word, “Yardein,” and not to the words following, “along the route of the sunset.” Rashi states a proof for this: “The cantillation of the passage proves they are two matters, since they are punctuated with two cantillation symbols, etc.” @d1As indicated by the word “beyond.” Wherever @HB<HEB>אחרי@BO<ENG> — “beyond” is mentioned, etc.@bo The word @hh<HEB>אחרי@it<ENG> spelled with a @ITyud@it refers to a great distance, as Rashi explains many times: “Wherever @hh<HEB>אחרי@it<ENG> is mentioned is refers to a great distance.” It may refer to a time distance, such as regarding Avraham (Bereishis 22:20), “After these things.” Or it may refer to a geographical distance, such as here.<QC>
@d1Beyond the Yardein toward the west, etc.@bo I.e., “Along the route, etc.” is an independent statement. It is as if the verse said, “Are they not across the Yardein and far beyond, along the route of the sunset — which is westward.” @d1Since they are punctuated with two cantillation symbols: @HB<HEB>אחרי@BO<ENG> (far beyond) is punctuated with the @BIpashta@BO symbol. @bo@ITPashta@it is one of the cantillation symbols that are called “kings,” and indicate a pause to separate [between this word and] the word following. @d1While @HB<HEB>דרך@BO<ENG> (the route) is punctuated with the @BImishpal@BO symbol and is dotted etc. @boThe @ITmishpal@it is what we call the @ITyasiv@it. @d1Then @HB<HEB>אחרי@BO<ENG> (far beyond) would be punctuated with the @BImeshares@BO symbol — the reverse @BIshofar@BO. @boThe reverse @ITshofar@it is what we call the @ITmahpach@it, which is like a @ITshofar@it. It is called @ITmeshares@it (servant), meaning that it connects the word to the word following. For this reason it is called @ITmeshares — @itbecause this word serves another word. @d1At a distance from Gilgal.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Wherever is written @hh<HEB>מול@it<ENG>, it denotes “opposite.” Yet sometimes it is nearby, and sometimes it is at a distance. But the verse gives an additional indication, “next to the Moreh Plain,” which means, “near the Moreh Plain,” we then understand that the word “opposite” here denotes at a distance. For if it were nearby then the verse should say, “Next to Gilgal and the Moreh Plain.” @d1This was Shechem, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Where do we find a place named Moreh Plain? Rashi answers: “This was Shechem, etc.” Although in Bereishis (12:6) it seems that Shechem and Moreh Plain are two distinct places, nevertheless we must say that because only one arrival is mentioned for both of them, we can infer that they are the same place. For if they were two places, then if Avraham arrived in Shechem he did not arrive in the Moreh Plain. Rather it is the same place. And the verses [in Bereishis] mean the following: “He arrived .<TIE>.<TIE>. in Shechem, which is the Moreh Plain.” See Rashi’s explanation there.<QC>
@p1[31]@p2<TIE>The miracles at the Yardein, etc.@bo Otherwise the verse should say, “You shall come to the land.<TIE>.<TIE>. you will inherit it.<TIE>.<TIE>. You will guard to fulfill, etc.” Furthermore, it already is written (v. 29), “When Adonoy .<TIE>.<TIE>. has brought you.” If so then why is, “For you shall pass across,” needed? Rather [it indicates]: “The miracles, etc.” @p1[2]@p2<TIE>Destroy, then destroy afterward, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Why is it written @hh<HEB>אבד תאבדון@it<ENG>, which is repetitive? Even though the Torah uses common speech, it should have said @hh<HEB>אבד תאבדו@it<ENG>. Yet it is written @hh<HEB>תאבדון@it<ENG> [i.e., an extra letter @ITnun@it] in order to be expounded. This is not in accordance with @ITRe”m@it’s explanation. @d1What must you obliterate from them?, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Why is it written, “You must obliterate all @ITthe places@it where the nations worshipped”? But whatever is connected to the earth [and certainly the earth itself] cannot become an idol (Avoda Zara 45a). Rather, “All the places,” means, “From the places. And what must you obliterate from them? Their gods, etc.” I.e., the words “their gods” are connected to, “You must obliterate,” and not to, “where the nations worshipped.” It is as if the verse says, “You must obliterate their gods on the mountains where the nations worshipped.” This is what Rashi means by saying, “What must you obliterate from them?” [“@ITAll@it the places,” taken literally, would include places that are impossible to destroy. But now that “all” is interpreted as “from,”] and it excludes any place that is impossible to destroy, such as worship of the celestial bodies. @p1[3]@p2<TIE>A tree that was worshipped.@bo Although the @ITasherah@it is connected to the earth and therefore should be considered as the earth itself, here is different. For man is involved at the very beginning when the seed is planted (Avoda Zara ibid.). Alternatively: Here [the verse refers to a tree that] was originally planted for the sake of idolatry. For according to all opinions, such a tree is completely forbidden (ibid. 48a), because it was planted originally for idol worship. @d1“The house of exaltation,” entitle, “The house of ruin,”, etc.@bo Rashi explains (in Temurah 28b): “The term @hh<HEB>בית גליא@it<ENG> denotes exaltation. The term @hh<HEB>בית כליא@it<ENG> denotes ruin. Another version says @hh<HEB>בית כריא@it<ENG> is a “bathroom,” from the phrase (See Yirmeyahu 18:20), “@hh<HEB>כורה שוחה@it<ENG> (he dug a pit).” See the @ITAruch@it. @p1[4]@p2<TIE>By bringing burnt-offerings for the sake of Heaven anywhere, etc.@bo I.e., “Do not act this way,” is connected to, “[All the places] where the nations worshipped, etc. (v. 2).” It is as if the verse says: “Do not act this way to Adonoy, your God, to bring burnt-offerings on the high mountains .<TIE>.<TIE>. where the nations worshipped.<TIE>.<TIE>. Rather at the place, etc.” @d1This prohibits erasing the sacred Name, and breaking an altar stone, etc.@bo I.e., specifically regarding idolatry did I command you, “You are to break apart, etc.,” but “Do not act this way to Adonoy your God.” The meaning of, “Rather at the place,” is: You should not act this way to Adonoy your God to break apart and destroy, rather He should be respected in your eyes to the point where you perpetually seek the place that He chooses .<TIE>.<TIE>. to bring there your burnt-offerings, etc. Rashi’s first explanation is problematic because the verse, “Do not act this way,” should have been written next to the above verse, “.<TIE>.<TIE>.their gods on the high mountains, etc.” And Rashi’s second explanation is problematic because the verse, “Rather at the place, etc.,” is apparently connected to the previous verses and needs to be explained somewhat differently than its plain meaning. Therefore the first explanation is also needed. @d1Rebbi Yishmael said, ‘Is it [conceivable] that an Israelite would smash altars? etc. @bo@ITRe”m@it writes: It seems to me that Rebbi Yishmael agrees that, “Do not act this way, etc.” prohibits erasing the sacred Name. For it is conceivable that the Israelite does not intend to erase the sacred Name in a destructive manner, but rather it was written in a non- respectful place or it was written in the wrong place and he therefore erases it; and his intention is for the sake of Heaven. For this reason erasing the Name needs to be prohibited. But regarding the breaking of an altar stone, one is liable only by breaking it in a destructive manner, a prohibition is not relevant because, “Is it conceivable etc.” Rebbi Yishmael disagrees with the first opinion [mentioned in the Sifrei — the previous opinion mentioned in Rashi] on one point, but he agrees with the other. @p1[5]@p2<TIE>This refers to the Tabernacle at Shiloh.@bo I.e., do not seek His Presence anywhere [you wish], because private altars are forbidden. It seems that Rashi’s inference is based on the apparently extra word @hh<HEB>לשכנו@it<ENG> (His Presence). For it would suffice to say, “Rather at the place .<TIE>.<TIE>. to set His Presence there.” Rather, the verse is referring to two places — Jerusalem and Shiloh. @ITRe”m’s@it explanation is difficult to understand (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it). @p1[6]@p2<TIE><NHS><NHS><HS><NHS>Obligatory @BIshelamim@BO-offerings.@bo I.e., @ITeven@it obligatory @ITshelamim@it-offerings, and certainly voluntary @ITshelamim@it- offerings. [Rashi specifies “obligatory” regarding Shiloh and Jerusalem] as opposed to a private altar where only a pledge or a donation may be offered. This is stated in Megillah (9b) and in Zevachim (117a) (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it). @d1And the second tithe to be eaten within the walls [of Jerusalem].@bo I.e., it is understandable that the animal tithe must be brought to Jerusalem, for it is sacrificed there. But why must he bring the second tithe there, for it is not offered? Rashi answers: To be eaten, etc. @d1To give to the @BIkohein@BO so that he may offer them up there. @boRashi is answering the question: The phrase, “the firstborn of your cattle,” implies that the Israelite is commanded to bring the firstborn as an offering. But this is not so, for the Israelite must @ITgive@it the firstborn to a @ITkohein@it. Rashi answers: The Israelite brings them to give to the, etc. @p1[7]@p2<TIE>According to the blessing, bring.@bo The words @hh<HEB>אשר ברכך@it<ENG> (lit. @ITwhen@it He has blessed you) means @hh<HEB>כאשר ברכך@it<ENG> (@ITas@it He has blessed you). This refers to, “your pledges and your donations,” which one has the option to increase according to the blessing. But for obligatory offerings [that one brings] there is no option to increase. The term @hh<HEB>אשר ברכך@it<ENG> must be explained in this way; otherwise it infers that only one who was blessed needs to bring. But this is not true, for the verse is referring to all of the Jewish People (@ITGur@it @ITAryeh@it). @p1[8]@p2<TIE>When you cross the Yardein, etc.@bo I.e., this verse, “You may not do,” does not refer to the previous verse, “You are to bring there (v. 6),” which discusses Shiloh. For if so, it would mean: “You may not do in Shiloh everything we do here today in the wilderness.” But it is impossible to say this, for the same sacrifices that were brought in the wilderness were also brought in Shiloh. Therefore we must say that, “You may not do,” refers to the above verse (11:31), “For you shall pass, etc.” This also proves what Rashi explained above (v. 6), “Your sacred offerings — obligatory @ITshelamim@it-<FJ> offerings [only in Shiloh and Jerusalem].” For Rashi explains here, “However, on a private altar you may not offer everything you offer at the Mishkon, etc.” If they brought obligatory @ITshelamim@it-offerings in the Mishkon and they were also permitted to do so on a private altar, then one may offer on a private altar whatever was offered in the Mishkon. Yet in the verse it is written, “You may not do everything we do here today, etc.” @p1[9]@p2<TIE>Throughout those fourteen years.@bo Rashi is answering the question: How is their not coming yet to the peace [Shiloh], a reason why they should not bring sacrifices immediately after crossing the Yardein? [I.e., why does the verse, “For you will not.<TIE>.<TIE>.” follow, “You may not do.<TIE>.<TIE>.”?] Rashi answers that, “For you will not have come,” means: Throughout @ITthose fourteen years@it of [your being occupied with] conquering and dividing, you will be unable to offer here [in the Mishkon] the obligatory offerings that you will offer in the future. @d1Like “yet.”@bo I.e., the term @hh<HEB>עד עתה@it<ENG> does not mean, “until now.” Otherwise it would mean, “Until this very day that we are standing in the desert.” This is impossible, for according to this, it would mean that they did not bring obligatory offerings in the desert. But this is not true, for they brought all types of sacrifices in the desert. Rather, the term@IT @hh<HEB>עדיין@it<ENG> refers also to the future — the fourteen years of conquering and dividing. In other words: Throughout those fourteen years you have not yet come to the peace.<TIE>.<TIE>. Therefore you will not bring obligatory offerings. @p1[10]@p2<TIE>And everyone distinguishes his portion, etc.@bo This is after the fourteen years of conquering and dividing the land. For prior to this is not called @hh<HEB>ישיבה@IT@it<ENG> (settling) since everyone has not yet distinguished the place upon which he will remain settled. Rashi explains similarly in Parshas Ki Savo (below 26:1), “And you will inherit and @ITsettle@it it — you are not obligated to bring the first fruit offering until after you have conquered and divided the land.” Furthermore, since it is written @hh<HEB>מנחיל אתכם@it<ENG> (is @ITapportioning@it to you) rather than @hh<HEB>נותן@it<ENG> (is giving), we can infer that the verse is addressing the period after the land has been settled. [I.e., the land cannot be apportioned until after it is settled, but the term “giving” may apply to simply entering the land].<QC>
@p1[11]@p2<TIE>The discussion above concerns Shiloh, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Scripture had already written above (v. 6), “You are to bring there, etc.” Rashi answers: The discussion above etc. @d1From the time that Shiloh was laid waste and they arrived at Nov, and Nov was laid waste etc. @boBut before they arrived at Nov, private altars were permitted. Once they arrived at Nov, private altars were again forbidden because the Mishkon was erected there. @p1[13]@p2<TIE>This places a negative commandment over the matter.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Scripture had already written above (v. 11), “It is @ITthere@it you shall bring,” which implies only there and nowhere else. Why does it need to say again, “Take heed”? Rashi answers: “This places a negative commandment over the matter.” @d1However, you may bring an offering by prophetic instruction, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Why is it written, “you envision”? It only needs to say, “anywhere.” The answer is: The words, “you envision,” teach us that bringing sacrifices is forbidden only in a place where @ITyou@it envision. However, you may bring an offering by prophetic instruction, etc. @p1[14]@p2<TIE>In Binyamin’s portion, etc.@bo Re”m writes: This follows the viewpoint that Jerusalem was [included with all the land] apportioned to the tribes, and it fell in Binyamin’s portion. But according to the viewpoint that Jerusalem was not apportioned to the tribes, we must say that “Of one of your tribes,” refers to Shiloh. But to me it seems: Even according to the viewpoint that Jerusalem was not apportioned to the tribes, the site of the Beis Hamikdash was [nevertheless] apportioned to Binyamin, as it is written (below 33:12), “Between his shoulders it [i.e. the Beis Hamikdash] shall reside.” But the [rest of] Jerusalem was not apportioned. @d1Above, however, it is said, “of all your tribes,”, etc.@bo The verse above must be dealing [in addition to Shiloh] also with the Beis Hamikdash. For it is written (v. 5), “Rather at the place that Adonoy, your God, chooses,” and we do not find that Hashem chose any place besides Jerusalem. The other places such as Gilgal, Givon, Nov, and Shiloh were chosen by the Israelites on their own. Perforce, “Rather at the place,” must be dealing with Shiloh and the Beis Hamikdash. And the term @hh<HEB>לשכנו@it<ENG> (His presence) [which refers to Shiloh] should be understood as @hh<HEB>ולשכנו@it<ENG> (@ITand@it His presence). It is a new and independent statement, and is not connected to what precedes it, “that Adonoy, your God, chooses,” which refers to the Beis Hamikdash. And therefore, Rashi’s question [“Above, however.<TIE>.<TIE>.”] fits well. [Otherwise, above would refer only to Shiloh, while here refers to the Beis Hamikdash, and there would be no contradiction]. @p1[15]@p2<TIE>Perhaps they may be redeemed even with a transient blemish?, etc.@bo I.e., even if they were afflicted with a blemish that will definitely heal, perhaps they may be redeemed and eaten immediately after being afflicted — even though it will ultimately heal. The Torah therefore teaches, “except.” For the terms, “except,” and “only,” are intended to exclude; and here it comes to exclude a transient blemish [from being redeemed]. @d1You are not permitted to shear or milk, etc.@bo The verse should [only] have said, “With the fullness of your appetite you may eat meat.” It is obviously slaughtered, for sacred and non-sacred animals are equal in this regard. Therefore they expounded [from the extra word, “slaughter,”] that only a benefit that requires slaughtering may be derived from unfit sacred animals. This excludes shearing and milking which are benefits that do not require slaughtering. @d1To permit the unclean and the clean to eat it in a single plate.@bo I.e., even though the meat eaten by the clean is touched by the unclean, for they are eating together from the same plate — As our Sages derive from the later verse (12:22), “So may you eat it; the unclean and the clean together,” which refers to sacred meat that became unfit, as explained in Chulin (28a). @ITRe”m@it writes: It is perplexing that Rashi quotes the verse, “Meat which came into contact with anything unclean, etc.,” to learn from this that a person who is clean may eat sacred meat that became unfit even when an unclean person has touched it. Instead he should have quoted the verse (Vayikra 12:4), “Any [food] that is sacred, she may not touch,” which prohibits one who is unclean from eating sacrificial meat — [and then Rashi should have said:] and therefore it is necessary to permit the unclean and the clean to eat it, etc. @ITRe”m@it answers: The verse, “Any [food] that is sacred she may not touch,” does not directly say that one who is unclean may not eat sacrificial meat. Rather, this is understood from the interpretation by our Sages. Therefore Rashi quotes the verse, “Meat which came into contact with anything unclean,” and learns that one who is clean may eat impure sacred meat that became unfit. But it seems to me: The verse, “Meat which came into contact .<TIE>.<TIE>. may not be eaten,” is Rashi’s direct proof that its main intent is to permit one who is clean to eat impure meat. Otherwise, it should not say that the clean is permitted to eat — for if the unclean is permitted to eat it, then certainly the clean should be permitted to eat it. Rather, it must be that the main intent of that verse is to teach that one who is clean may eat impure meat, as we have explained. @d1Which are not eligible as sacrifices.@bo I.e., for this reason it [impure meat] is exempt from the gifts [of the foreleg, the maw, and the jaw], like the deer and the gazelle that are exempt since they are not eligible as sacrifices, as Rashi explains afterwards. @p1[16]@p2<TIE>Its blood is not to be sprinkled on the altar, etc.@bo I.e., one might think that eating blood is prohibited only in order to sprinkle it on the altar [and therefore it would be permitted here], so the verse lets us know differently [that “You may not eat the blood,”] However, it is perplexing that we need this verse. For we can derive this from the verse in Parshas Acharei Mos (Vayikra 17:10), “Whoever eats @ITany@it blood, etc.,” which teaches [a prohibition] regarding blood even from ordinary meat — as Rashi explains there. Perhaps the answer is: The prohibition is written twice [though it is unnecessary]. @ITRe”m@it explains likewise above in Parshas Acharei Mos. But it seems to me that if we only had the verse, “Whoever eats, etc.,” then we might think: Even though they are ordinary animals, but since at the time of slaughtering they were unblemished and their blood was thus fit to be offered upon the altar, therefore the Torah prohibits [eating] their blood. However, this is not so regarding sacred sacrifices that became unfit, therefore an additional verse is necessary to forbid its blood. See what I wrote above in Parshas Acharei Mos. @d1This teaches you that it does not require covering.@bo Since Scripture compares it to the deer and gazelle, we might think: Just as the deer and gazelle require covering [of their blood], so too this animal requires covering. Therefore the verse needs to write, “Spill it like water,” to say that it does not require covering (@ITRe”m@it). Additionally, we might think that blood of all animals requires covering, since the term @hh<HEB>בהמה@it<ENG> (domesticated animal) is included under the term @hh<HEB>חיה@it<ENG> (wild animal); and just as the blood of a wild animal requires covering, so too regarding a domesticated animal. Therefore the phrase, “Spill it like water,” teaches us: Just as water does not require covering, so too the blood of sacred animals that became unfit [does not require covering]. And from this we may extrapolate that the blood of all domesticated animals does not require covering. See chapter @ITKisui Hadam@it (Chulin 84a), where this is explicitly written. @d1Another interpretation: It is like water, etc.@bo The first interpretation is problematic, because why is the word, “water,” needed? The verse only needs to write, “On the earth you are to spill it,” and we would know that it does not require covering. Therefore, another interpretation is needed. But the second interpretation on its own [is problematic], for this verse should have been written over there [in the section] regarding the conditioning (@IThechsher@it) of edible seeds (Vayikra 11:38). Therefore we also need the first interpretation. @p1[17]@p2<TIE>This passage places a negative commandment, etc.@bo Re”m writes: Since Rashi does not say, “This is a negative commandment,” but rather says at length, “This passage, etc.,” I must say that this is only hinted at in the verse. But the verse’s primary intention is to forbid eating outside the wall of [Jerusalem]. [Re”m continues:] Alternatively, Rashi’s intent is: Although it is written above (v. 6), “You are to bring there your burnt-offerings, etc.,” which implies — and not outside the wall of Jerusalem. Nevertheless it says afterwards, “You are not permitted to eat in your cities,” in order to place a negative commandment over the matter, as above (v. 13. See Rashi’s explanation there under the caption, “This places a negative commandment, etc.”).<QC>
@d1The statues on which the oath was inscribed.@bo This refers to the oath sworn by Avraham and Yitzchak to Avimelech. The blind statues represent Yitzchak, and the lame statues represent Yaakov, about whom the verse writes (Bereishis 32:32), “And he limped due to his hip.” @d1This prohibition applies to the @BIkohanim.@it Rashi is answering the question: Why is it written, “the first born of you cattle,” when [only] the @ITkohein@it is commanded regarding [eating] the first born? @d1This refers to the first fruits.@bo I.e., this prohibits eating them outside the walls [of Jerusalem], and [for violating the prohibition one] incurs lashes. @p1[18]@p2<TIE>Within the walls.@bo [Referring to the walls of Jerusalem] but not [in reference to] within the Temple courtyard as in, “And slaughter the young bull @ITbefore@it @ITAdonoy@it (Vayikra 1:5).” [We know this from context], for note that nothing mentioned above is eaten in the Temple courtyard — for only the most holy offerings are eaten there, but not the offerings of lesser holiness.<QC>
@p1[19]@p2<TIE>This places a negative commandment over the matter.@bo As I explained above (v. 13). For anywhere it says, “Take heed, etc.” Rashi is answering the question: Why is the verse, “Watch yourself,” needed? It is already written above (v. 12), “And the Levite who is in you cities, etc.” If so, why does this need to be written twice? Rashi answers: “This places a negative commandment over the matter.” In other words: Over the matter mentioned above, “And the Levite who is in your cities, etc.” This is why Rashi chose to say, “Over the matter.” @d1In the diaspora, however, you are not admonished, etc.@bo The reason is because in the Land of Israel, the Israelites received portions in the Land whereas the Levites did not. Therefore, they must attend to the Levites. But in the diaspora, the Israelites, just as the Levites, did not receive any portion of the land.<QC>
@p1[20]@p2<TIE>Unless he enjoys expansion and affluence.@bo You might ask: This verse, simply understood, refers to the expansion of borders and becoming distanced from the Land. Why does Rashi deviate from the plain meaning? The answer is: It is written afterwards, “When the place is distant from you, etc.,” which refers to the expansion of borders. If so, what is the meaning of, “When .<TIE>.<TIE>. expands your borders”? It must be referring to expansion [of possessions] and affluence. And “borders,” refers to fields and vineyards, which is affluence. This explanation is according to Rebbi Elazar ben Azaryah (@ITChulin@it 84a). @d1However in the wilderness, non-sacrificial meat was forbidden, etc.@bo The meaning of @hh<HEB>בכל אות נפשך@it<ENG> (anything you desire), is “any @ITspecies@it that you desire,” whether or not you may bring it as a peace offering. This is according to Rebbi Yishmael (@ITChulin@it 17b), who expounds the verse, “When .<TIE>.<TIE>. expands your borders,” refers to the expansion of borders, that is, after they entered the Land. But according to Rebbi Elazar (ibid. 84a) who expounds that [the verse] refers to expansion [of possessions] and affluence, it is not possible to say, “However in the wilderness, non-sacrificial meat was forbidden, etc.” For it simply says, “Anything you desire,” whether after coming to the Land or before coming to the Land. Rashi’s commentary is very difficult [to understand], because first he explains that, “When .<TIE>.<TIE>. expands your borders,” refers to expansion [of property] and affluence. How then does he reverse himself and explain afterwards that it refers to the expansion of borders? Furthermore, Rashi explains the verse, “Anything you desire,” according to Rebbi Yishmael who says that, “When .<TIE>.<TIE>. expands your borders,” refers [literally] to the expansion of borders, how then can he explain the verse, “When .<TIE>.<TIE>. the place is distant from you,” [also meaning] as its borders becoming more distant [i.e., expansion of borders. For this is seemingly redundant.]? (@ITRe”m@it). But to me it seems: Rebbi Elazar agrees with Rebbi Yishmael that, “Anything you desire,” means that non-sacrificial meat was not permitted to them in the wilderness. For it is written afterwards, “When the place is distant from you .<TIE>.<TIE>. you may slaughter some of your cattle or your flocks.” And the verse, “When the place is distant,” refers to the expansion of place [i.e. borders], and not according to Rebbi Yishmael who explains it as, “From a place that is distant you may slaughter [non-sacrificial meat] but not from a place that is near, for you may not slaughter non-sacrificial meat in the Temple courtyard.” And the verse, “When .<TIE>.<TIE>. expands your borders, etc.,” he expounds as, “One should not eat meat unless he enjoys expansion and affluence.” And he agrees with Rebbi Yishmael on one point [that non-sacrificial meat was forbidden in the wilderness], but disagrees with him on another [whether the verse, “When the place is distant,” prohibits the slaughter of non-sacrificial meat in the Temple courtyard]. See @ITChulin@it 16b and 84a. @p1[22]@p2<TIE>You are not admonished to eat them in ritual purity, etc.@bo [We might think:] Non-sacrificial animals eaten to satisfy one’s appetite, from a species that is offered as a sacrifice, must be eaten in ritual purity — just as the sacrificial meat. This would be similar to the fats of non-sacrificial meat which we are forbidden to eat because they are from a species that is offered as a sacrifice. [Therefore, the phrase, “As the deer and the gazelle,”] teaches us otherwise. @d1Perhaps, just as the fat of the deer and gazelle are permitted, etc.@bo In other words: The fat of the deer and gazelle is permitted because they are not offered as sacrifices on the altar. Perhaps so too, the fat of any animal that is not offered as a sacrifice would be permitted. The Torah therefore teaches, “only.” I.e., the word, “only,” is a term that excludes. Rashi has explained this verse according to its simple meaning — that, “Only, as the deer, etc.,” refers to the ritual purity and impurity of non-sacrificial meat. Our Sages, however, expound from here that it comes to teach that the deer and gazelle require ritual slaughtering (@ITChulin@it 28a). @p1[23]@p2<TIE>You must exercise strength with @BImitzvos@BO, etc.@bo For a person’s evil inclination constantly tempts him to transgress Hashem’s will. Therefore, even regarding [seemingly] easy @ITmitzvos@it, a person must exercise strength. All the more so regarding other @ITmitzvos@it that a person craves [to transgress them] (@ITMaharai@it). @d1This prohibits the limb of a living animal.@bo The verse means to say, “Do not eat @ITfrom it@it @ITwhile@it the spirit is with the meat.<QC>
@p1[24]@p2<TIE>This prohibits the dripping @BItamtzis@BO blood.@bo The term @hh<HEB>דם התמצית@it<ENG> means the blood that drips at the time of slaughtering. Three types of [@ITtamtzis@it] blood come out at the time of slaughtering: The first is black, the second is red, afterwards it gushes [which is not @ITtamtzis@it blood], and afterwards it drips again. All three [the first two and the last one] are called the dripping @ITtamtzis@it blood. The blood of the limbs is blood that has moved from one place to another — even though it is still absorbed and did not come out of the limb, it is forbidden. However, if the blood never left its original place then it is not included by the prohibition, “Do not eat it.” This is explained in Chulin (14a). (See Tosefos there) @p1[25]@p2<TIE>This prohibits the blood absorbed in the limbs.@bo Rashi’s explanation poses a difficulty, for in chapter “@ITKol Habasar@it”@IT@it (@ITChulin@it 115b), this verse, “Do not eat it,” is understood to prohibit [the combination of] meat and milk. And [furthermore,] Rashi himself explains likewise in the first chapter of @ITKrisus@it (4b). @ITRe”m@it also raises this difficulty. However, it seems to me: Rashi’s explanation here follows the viewpoint of the other @ITTannaim@it and @ITAmoraim@it in chapter “@ITKol Habasar@it.” And they learn out the prohibition not to eat meat and milk from other verses (see there). One @ITTanna@it learns out [the prohibition not to eat meat and milk] from the verse, ‘Do not cook a kid in its mother’s milk,’ which is written three times, and one of them is intended to prohibit eating [them together].” See Rashi above in Parshas Mishpatim (Shmos 23:19). But Rashi’s explains in @ITKrisus@it follows the viewpoint of Rebbi who explains that, “Do not eat it,” is a prohibition not to eat meat and milk. @p1[27]@p2<TIE>If they are burnt-offerings, place the flesh, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Why is this verse necessary to be written? For it is already written (v. 26), “However, your sacred offerings .<TIE>.<TIE>. you are to bring when you come to the place that Adonoy chooses,” which includes all types of offerings. An additional question: At first it is written, “You are to execute your burnt-offerings — the meat and the blood — @ITon the altar@it of Adonoy.” But afterwards it is written, “Then @ITyou will eat@it the meat,” which is apparently self-contradictory! Rashi answers that this verse is explaining the previous one, and it should be understood as follows: “If they are burnt-offerings, place the flesh and the blood on the altar. But if they are peace-offerings, etc.” The reason why Rashi says @hh<HEB>על גבי המזבח@it<ENG> (on @ITtop of@it the altar) regarding burnt-offerings, but he says @hh<HEB>על המזבח@it<ENG> (on the altar) regarding peace-offerings is as follows: The flesh and blood of burnt-offerings are placed on top of the altar, not on the altar itself. But the blood of peace-offerings is placed on the altar itself, not on top of it. @d1This teaches concerning sacrificial-offerings outside the Land.@bo I.e., if a person who is outside the Land sanctifies an animal as a sacrifice, he must take care in transporting it until he brings it to the Temple [as indicated by the previous verse, “.<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>you are to bring when you come.”] @p1[28]@p2<TIE>But anyone who is not involved in study, etc.@bo For if he has not learned, how will he [know what to] do? @d1A minor commandment should be as precious .<TIE>.<TIE>. as one of great consequence, etc.@bo Otherwise, why is the word, “all,” needed? Let Scripture write only, “These words that I am commanding you,” which implies, “all of them.” @d1In the eyes of mortals.@bo This means, for example, the neighbor’s law of preemption, [e.g., a neighbor must be given the first chance to buy one’s property], which is only [derived] from [the verse], “Perform the upright and the good (Devarim 6:18).” @p1[30]@p2<TIE>After you observe when I have annihilated them before you, etc.@bo Rashi found this verse difficult, for its simple meaning implies: Only after the Canaanite nations have been annihilated then you are warned not to be torn apart along with them [i.e., not to follow in their ways], but not beforehand! Therefore, Rashi explains, “After you observe, etc.”<QC>
@d1For example, exposing oneself for the sake of Peor, etc.@bo I.e., exposing the anus towards it and defecating. This is the manner of Peor’s worship. @p1[31]@p2<TIE>Before his dog, who then ate him.@bo @hh<HEB>כלבו@it<ENG> (his dog) was his god. @hh<HEB>ואכלו@it<ENG> (and ate him) is the equivalent of burning in fire. With this understanding, the words of R’ Akiva are a proof to Rashi’s explanation [regarding the word, “Even.”].<QC>
@p1[1]@p2<TIE>Five @BItotafos@BO within the @BItefilin,@BO etc.@bo See my explanation above in Parshas Va’eschanan (4:2). Rashi’s statement, “five species with the @ITlulav@it,” refers to where he @ITbinds@it them so that the five species are all bound together — For [only] then does he transgress. But if he did not bind them together, he does not transgress. Even according to the viewpoint that a @ITlulav@it does not need binding, it is nevertheless understood that if he binds them together he transgresses the prohibition of, “Do not add.” @p1[2]@p2<TIE>And should you ask, why the Holy One, may He be blessed, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: The word @hh<HEB>כי@it<ENG> (for) is always a reason being given for what was written above. Yet here, how is it giving a reason? Therefore Rashi explains: “And if you should ask, etc.” And now the word, “for,” fits well as giving a reason. @p1[5]@p2<TIE>The voice of the prophets.@bo I.e., “Keep His commandments,” already implies the entire Torah given through Moshe, which includes all His commandments. If so, what is the meaning of, “Heed His voice”? Rather, it includes the voice of the prophets. @d1In His Sanctuary.@bo The word “serve” refers to sacrifices, which is in the Sanctuary. For if it refers to the service of fulfilling His commandments, this has already been mentioned. @d1Embrace His ways; engage in kindness, etc.@bo Why does Rashi not explain similarly above in Parshas Eikev (10:20) where it also written, “Cleave to Him”? The answer is: The simple meaning of the verse in Eikev [actually] is: “Embrace His ways; engage in kindness, etc.” But here in order that we do not make a mistake to explain [in a similar fashion] the verse “After Adonoy, your God, are you to go<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” that it means “@ITafter@it having acquired all of these attributes, then “Cleave to Him” — in order that you shall have His Divine Providence. Therefore, Rashi needed to explain: “Embrace His ways, etc.” @p1[6]@p2<TIE>Even if He had done nothing for you but redeemed you, etc.@bo Otherwise why is the phrase, “Who redeemed you from the house of bondage,” necessary? For Scripture had already written, “Who took you out of the land of Egypt.” And when He took them out, they had already been set free [i.e., redeemed]. @p1[7]@p2<TIE>The word @HB<HEB>הסתה@BO<ENG> always denotes inciting .<TIE>.<TIE>. He seduces him, etc.@bo You might ask: At first Rashi explains, “The expression @hh<HEB>הסתה@it<ENG> always denotes inciting,” but afterwards he writes, “He @ITseduces @ithim, etc.,” which denotes to mislead. This question has already been answered by @ITRe”m@it in Parshas Bereishis regarding the verse (3:13), “The serpent seduced me.” He writes: Although the term @hh<HEB>הסתה@it<ENG> usually means, “to mislead,” nevertheless Rashi explains here [in Re’ey], “The word @hh<HEB>הסתה@it<ENG> always denotes inciting .<TIE>.<TIE>. he seduces him, etc.” This is because inciting is only accomplished through words that are misleading. And the meaning of [Rashi’s words], “He seduces him into performing the act,” is, “he misleads him into performing the act.” @d1Maternally.@bo A @ITvav@it is lacking, [and it means as if it said] @hh<HEB>ובן אמך@it<ENG> (@ITor@it your mother’s son). It is not correct to say that only a brother from the same father @ITand@it mother is intended. For we find the term “brother,” indicates even a paternal brother, as in (Bereishis 42:13), “Your servants are twelve brothers,” and (below 25:5), “If brothers reside together.” Rather, the verse must be understood as if it said, “or.” [“Your @ITmother’s@it son,” is written] because one’s paternal brother is more beloved to him than his maternal brother. @d1This refers to your father, etc.@bo [Rashi is referring to the term, “soul mate,” and] the verse is lacking the word “or.” For a father is never referred to as @hh<HEB>ריע@it<ENG> (neighbor). @p1[8]@p2<TIE>This refers to the sun, the moon, and the heavenly hosts, etc.@bo Otherwise Scripture should have written only, “At a distance from you to the ends of the earth.”<QC>
@p1[9]@p2<TIE>Do not be inclined towards him, etc.@bo For this verse cannot be understood according to its simple meaning — “Do not agree with his words, and do not accept them.” For if so, what is the meaning of, “Do not view him compassionately .<TIE>.<TIE>. for you must certainly execute him, etc.” He is about to be executed! Does the verse need to warn, “Do not agree with his words, and do not accept his words to serve other gods”? @d1Because it states, “Lay aside [your hatred of him] and assist him,”, etc.@bo Onkelos explains @hh<HEB>עזוב תעזוב@it<ENG> as, “Lay aside whatever is in your heart against him,” which means to [put aside] the hatred in your heart and be forgiving to him. Although Rashi explains above (Shmos 23:5) that the term @hh<HEB>עזוב תעזוב@it<ENG> denotes assistance, here he says that it denotes forgiveness, because Rashi above is explaining the simple meaning of the verse. (@ITMaharai@it explains likewise).<QC>
@p1[10]@p2<TIE>Do not retry him to exonerate him.@bo Otherwise why does it need to say @hh<HEB>הרג תהרגנו@it<ENG> (lit., you shall execute, execute him), which is apparently repetitive? Even though the Torah uses common speech, @ITRe”m@it says: “We only say this if there is nothing to expound [from the apparent redundancy]. But if there is something to be expounded, then we do so.” But it seems to me that Rashi is answering the question: The entire phrase @hh<HEB>הרוג תהרגנו@it<ENG> is seemingly superfluous! For it is written afterwards, “Let your hand strike him first to execute him.” Therefore, “surely execute him,” is to be expounded. @p1[13]@p2<TIE>Which was not given as a dwelling place, etc.@bo I.e., to any individual, but rather any Israelite has the right to dwell there, because Jerusalem was not apportioned to the tribes. @d1Saying the following: Men have gone out, etc.@bo I.e., the word @hh<HEB>לאמר@it<ENG> (saying) here does not follow its usual meaning — “say again,” or, “say to them words of rebuke.” Rather, it is connected to the verse following [“Men have gone out.”] @p1[14]@p2<TIE>But not women.@bo Otherwise why is the word @hh<HEB>אנשים@it<ENG> (men) needed? For Scripture already writes @hh<HEB>בני בליעל@it<ENG> (unscrupulous people). And this is why Rashi explains @hh<HEB>בליעל@it<ENG> before he explains @hh<HEB>אנשים@it<ENG> [even though it appears in the verse later].<QC>
@p1[15]@p2<TIE>“Thoroughly” and “Thoroughly” are extrapolated by the principle of textual comparison etc.@bo It is as if they are all written together, “You must (1)<TIE>investigate, and (2)<TIE>inquire (3)<TIE>thoroughly, and the magistrates must (4)<TIE>investigate (5)<TIE>thoroughly, and you must (6)<TIE>investigate (7)<TIE>thoroughly,”  —  these are the seven [inquiries].<QC>
@p1[1]@p2<TIE>Do not inflict lacerations and gashes on your flesh, etc.@bo I.e., a prohibition only applies to a person carrying out an action, and not on the one to whom the action is carried out. Since the [@IThitpa’el @itverb form of] the term @hh<HEB>לא תתגודדו@it<ENG> (do not lacerate yourself) usually emphasizes on whom the action is carried out, therefore Rashi explains, “Do not inflict lacerations on your flesh.” And Rashi says @hh<HEB>גדידה ושרט@it<ENG> (lacerations @ITand gashes@it) to let us know that @hh<HEB>גדידה@it<ENG> is a type of gash — the two words are synonymous. See Parshas Emor (Vayikra 21:5), where this verse has been fully explained.<QC>
@p1[2]@p2<TIE>Your own sanctity extends from your forefathers, etc.@bo I.e., your sanctity does not stem from you but rather from your forefathers. Otherwise why is, “And Adonoy has chosen you,” needed afterwards? For this means, “And furthermore Adonoy has chosen you,” is a second reason. But their own sanctity [alone] would suffice why Hashem chose them! @p1[3]@p2<TIE>Anything I made abominable to you, etc.@bo You might ask: Why then are we permitted to eat castrated chickens and animals? For Hashem made them abominable to us — it is forbidden to castrate them. The answer is: Since we need a verse (Vayikra 22:25) to prohibit their acceptance as a sacrifice, we can then infer that they are permitted for non-sacrificial purposes.<QC>
@p1[6]@p2<TIE>Split.@bo The word @hh<HEB>מפרסת@it<ENG> is not related to the word @hh<HEB>פרסה@it<ENG> (hoof). Otherwise, the verse regarding the camel (Vayikra 11:4) @hh<HEB>ופרסה איננו מפריס@it<ENG>, would mean, “It does not have a hoof with which to step on the ground.” But this is not so! Therefore Rashi explains that the word @hh<HEB>מפרסת@it<ENG> denotes being “split.” In other words, the hoof is split. @d1The inference it, ‘what is found within the animal, you may eat,’, etc.@bo I.e., since it is written in the beginning of this verse, “And every animal whose sole is cloven<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” then what does the phrase, “within the animals, it you may eat” teach us? Rather, put the first word, “animal” in front of the second one and explain it as follows: “Every animal that is found within an animal, you may eat.” Rashi uses the term, “fetus,” to exclude a case in which an animal is slaughtered and the likeness of a dove is found inside, for [in order to be permitted to eat the animal] hooves are required, but are lacking. @p1[11]@p2<TIE>This permits the bird released by the @BImetzora.@bo I.e., the word @hh<HEB>כל@it<ENG> (all) is an inclusive term [and here it comes] to include the bird released by the @ITmetzora@it. @p1[12]@p2<TIE>This prohibits the slaughtered bird [offered by the @BImetzora@BO].@bo Apparently it is expounded this way because the phrase, “This is what you may not eat,” is apparently superfluous. For below it is written (v. 19), “And all flying creeping creatures are ritually unclean for you, they may not be eaten.” Rather, the verse here intends to forbid the bird that is slaughtered by the @ITmetzora@it. The Gemora (Kiddushin 57a) asks, “I would say the opposite — forbid the [@ITmetzora’s@it] released bird and permit the slaughtered bird.” And the Gemora answers, “The Torah does not say to release the bird if eventually it may cause a liability” — that a person might unknowingly sin by taking and eating it. @ITRe”m@it asks: If [this reasoning is] so, then why is the phrase, “[You may eat] any pure bird,” needed to permit the released bird? @ITRe”m@it answers: The explanation, “Any pure bird — this permits the released bird,” is only an @ITasmachta@it [a loose interpretation]. Also Rashi there says this explicitly (ibid.). @p1[13]@p2<TIE>@BIAyah,@BO and @BIdayah@BO are one and the same, etc.@bo Rashi’s proof is: The Mishnah Torah [i.e., the book of Devarim] only intends to add upon what was previously written above in Toras Kohanim [i.e., the book of Vayikra]. And if so, why is it not written here, “The @ITda’ah@it and the @ITra’ah@it,” to [include what was said in Vayikra and merely] add [the @ITra’ah@it] to it? This would be similar to what is said in @ITChulin@it (63b), “Why are the animals repeated? Because of the dromedary, which is not mentioned in Vayikra.” If so, why does the verse (Vayikra 11:14) say, “@ITda’ah,@it” yet here it says, “@ITra’ah@it,” but not, “@ITda’ah@it”? Rather, this indicates that @ITra’ah@it and @ITda’ah@it are one and the same. Therefore Scripture here does not write “@ITda’ah@it.” For if it did, I would think that the @ITra’ah@it and the @ITda’ah@it are different animals, and that the verse is coming to add [the @ITra’ah@it]. For this reason the verse here only says, “@ITra’ah@it,” to teach that the @ITda’ah@it and @ITra’ah@it are one and the same. Furthermore, Rashi is answering the question: If so [that the @ITda’ah@it and @ITra’ah@it are the same], then the verse should say, “and the @ITra’ah@it according to its kind@it,” to include the @ITda’ah@it mentioned in Vayikra. For this reason Rashi explains, “The @ITra’ah@it, @ITayah@it, and @ITdayah@it are one and the same.” The indication that they are all the same is because in the verse it is written, “according to its kind,” at the end to group them all together to teach that they are one and the same. Furthermore Rashi is answering the question: If they are all one and the same, why does the verse say, “The @ITra’ah@it and (@hh<HEB>ואת@it<ENG>) the @ITayah @itand the @ITdayah@it according to its kind”? Why is the word @hh<HEB>ואת@it<ENG>, which interrupts between the words @ITra’ah@it and @ITayah@it, needed? Rashi answers: Why is it entitled “ra’ah”, etc. In other words, the verse interrupts [with the word @hh<HEB>ואת@it<ENG>] to say that this name [that it has] is different from its other names. For it is called “@ITra’ah@it” because its vision is exceedingly powerful, as is taught in @ITChulin@it (ibid.), “While standing in Babylon it can see a carcass in the Land of Israel.” @ITRe”m’s@it explanation is most difficult to understand. See the Gemora (ibid.). @d1With the birds, the impure ones are specified. This teaches, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: After having explained that all its names are specified, etc. so that one will not come to permit them, the question arises, why would one come to permit them? For perhaps they are from the impure birds and they were not specified — just as the pure birds were not specified. Rashi answers: “The impure ones are specified, etc.” If these names were not specified [among the impure birds], then certainly they would be pure. Therefore all its names are specified. Alternatively: Since the pure birds are more numerous than the impure ones, we would follow the majority — which is pure — and consider it pure. Therefore all its names are specified. @d1Therefore, those less numerous are specified.@bo But regarding the animals, the pure ones are specified.<QC>
@p1[21]@p2<TIE>Sanctify yourselves by abstaining from that which is permitted, etc.@bo @ITRe”m@it writes: This prohibition, “Do not eat any carcass,” is not for the sake of beauty, as is, “Do not lacerate yourself (v. 1),” which is only for the sake of beauty — as Rashi explains there [and therefore it says there, “You are a sacred people” afterwards]. Rather, “Do not eat any carcass,” is required for the [well being of the] soul, and the phrase, “For you are a people sanctified, etc.,” does not apply to it. Therefore our sages explain: Since you are a sanctified people, it is fitting to sanctify yourselves even regarding that which is permitted to you, etc. But to me it seems that Rashi is answering the question: Why does the verse here say differently from what is written at the end of Parshas Shmini (Vayikra 11:43). It should say here instead, “Do not eat any carcass and do not make yourselves repulsive, etc.” The reason why it is written, “For you are a people sanctified to Adonoy, etc.,” is to expound, “Sanctify yourselves, etc.” @d1Three times; this excludes wild animals, fowl, etc.@bo Rashi’s explanation above in Parshas Mishpatim (Shmos 23:19), “This comes to forbid eating, cooking, and deriving benefit,” is based on the phrase, “do not cook,” which is written three times. But Rashi’s explanation here, “This excludes wild animals, fowl, and impure animals,” is based on the word, “kid,” which is written three times. @p1[22]@p2<TIE>What is the relationship between the two subjects? etc.@bo Although Rashi does not explain why subjects are juxtaposed unless they are written out of place, in Mishnah Torah he does — just as he explains below in Parshas Ki Seitzei regarding the verse (21:11), “.<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>And take her for yourself as a wife, etc.” @d1Do not cause Me to cook the young shoots of your crops, etc.@bo The word @hh<HEB>לבשל@it<ENG> (lit., to cook) here means, “to destroy.” The word @hh<HEB>גדיים@it<ENG> (lit., kids) here refers to grain still in its stalks and nearly ripe. @d1Similarly, with regard to the @BIbikurim@BO-gift.@bo If you do not bring the first-fruit offering, then your fruits will be destroyed. In other words: We also learn from the juxtaposition of the first-fruit offering to the verse, “You must not cook a kid, etc.,” of Parshas Mishpatim (Shmos 23:19) and Ki Sisa (ibid. 34:26) where it is written, “The first fruits of your land bring to the House of the Adonoy your God. You must not cook a kid in its mother’s milk.” Therefore Rashi says, “Similarly.” In other words: Although Rashi usually does not explain why subjects are juxtaposed, nevertheless since, “.<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>do not cook, etc.,” is expounded here, we also expound it there. @d1From here it is derived that one may not use the new crop, etc.@bo Rashi’s explanation is not precise; the old crop also may not be used as tithe for the new. But Rashi is teaching us a greater novelty. Even the new may not be used as tithe for the old — the superior for the inferior. Then certainly the old may not be used as tithe for the new — the inferior for the superior. @p1[24]@p2<TIE>So that the grain is too abundant to carry.@bo The phrase, “For Adonoy .<TIE>.<TIE>. has blessed you,” refers to, “If you will be unable to carry it,” for the blessing only applies to the abundance of grain. But it does not apply to, “because the place is distant,” which means the expansion of borders by conquering other lands. For the blessing does not apply to the conquest of other lands.<QC>
@p1[26]@p2<TIE>The earth’s progeny [.<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>and it grows upon the soil]@bo. “The earth’s progeny,” [literally, “The produce of the earth’s produce”] refers to such items as grapevines from grape seeds, and excludes water, salt, truffles, and mushrooms. And, “grows upon the soil,” excludes fish.<QC>
@p1[27]@p2<TIE>By neglecting to give him the first tithe.@bo This [verse, “You must not abandon,”] does not mean to invite the Levite to your table if he neither has first tithes nor tithes to the poor, as Rashi explained above regarding (12:18), “Before Adonoy, your God, are you to eat it .<TIE>.<TIE>. you and your son .<TIE>.<TIE>. [and the Levite], etc.” For the verse above refers to eating, as it is written, “Before Adonoy, your God, are you to eat it, etc.” But here the Levite is not included in eating with him. For it is written, “You will eat it there in the presence of Adonoy .<TIE>.<TIE>. and you will rejoice, you and your household, etc.,” and the matter is concluded and another verse begins, “And the Levite who is in your city, you must not abandon” — by neglecting to give him his portion which is the first tithe. @d1This excludes the gleaning, forgotten sheaves and edge of the field<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. Hence, they are exempt from tithing.@bo I.e., why does the Levite have a portion in them? Because they — the gleaning, forgotten sheaves, edge of the field, and abandoned produce — are exempt from tithing. You might ask: Do we not find regarding the Levite in Parshas Korach (Bamidbar 18:29), “From all your gifts you must set aside all the @ITterumah@it-gifts of Adonoy”? The answer is: Everything that it given to the Levites as a gift, tithes must be given from it. But these [the gleaning, forgotten sheaves, etc.] are not given to them as a gift. Rather, they are abandoned to all. @p1[29]@p2<TIE>And take the first tithe.@bo This verse is abridged. For without adding, “.<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>and take the first tithe,” it seems that the Levite, proselyte, orphan, and widow are treated equally; that you are to give them [enough] food to eat their fill. @d1You must bring to Jerusalem, etc.@bo I.e., you must bring the @ITsecond@it tithes of the first and second year in order to eat it in Jerusalem, and confess, “I have divested my home of the sacred produce.” In the first and second years of the Sabbatical cycle, the first and second tithes are separated each year. Likewise, in the fourth and fifth years [of the Sabbatical cycle]. In the third and sixth years the first tithes and tithes to the poor are separated. The tithes to the poor and the first tithes may be eaten anywhere, but the second tithes must be eaten in Jerusalem (as explained elsewhere).<QC>
@p1[2]@p2<TIE>Of every creditor.@bo The verse is disarranged, for the @ITshmitah@it only applies to the hand of the creditor [and not to his entire self] — that he shall not have a hand [i.e., the ability] to claim his debt. Rashi adds the word @hh<HEB>של@it<ENG> (of) because it says @hh<HEB>ידו@it<ENG> [spelled] with a @ITvav@it (@IThis@it hand), then we need to explain whose hand it is. Therefore Rashi continues and says, “.<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>of every creditor.” Rashi also adds the word @hh<HEB>את@it<ENG>, to indicate that “his hand” is the object. For without the word @hh<HEB>את@it<ENG> then “his hand” is the subject, as in “And his hand reaches (Vayikra 25:26).”<QC>
@p1[5]@p2<TIE>Then there will be no one destitute among you.@bo The word, “only,” is connected to the previous verse, “End it [poverty], so that there will be no one destitute among you.” As if it said: The promise to you, “There will be no one destitute among you,” applies “Only if you will listen.” @d1Listen a little, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: What is the meaning of “only” that is written in this verse? For every instance of, “only,” is an exclusionary term. Rashi explains: It is excluding from, “listen,” and perforce it is coming to be expounded, “Listen @ITa little@it, and you will be given the opportunity to listen much.” @p1[7]@p2<TIE>The neediest [lit., whoever desires most] should be given preference.@bo The most destitute among them. In other words: If someone needs a particular item then give it to him first, since he desires it most. @d1Your paternal brother should be given preference over your maternal brother.@bo Otherwise why is the term @hh<HEB>מאחד@it<ENG> (among one of) needed? Rashi interprets the word @hh<HEB>מאחד@it<ENG> as @hh<HEB>מיוחד@it<ENG> (@ITa particular@it brother), which is referring to your paternal brother. For it is written below (25:5) says [a related term, @hh<HEB>יחדו@it<ENG> regarding paternal brothers], “When brothers dwell @hh<HEB>יחדו@it<ENG> (together).” @p1[8]@p2<TIE>This refers to a wife, etc.@bo In other words, you must provide him with a wife. @p1[9]@p2<TIE>Perhaps this is a @BImitzvah@BO? The Torah therefore teaches, “So that he does not cry out.”@bo That verse is written in Parshas Ki Seitzei (below 24:15). Even though that verse deals with a day laborer, and the verse here pertains to lending to the poor, nevertheless they both pertain to the @ITpoor@it. For it is written here, “Your @ITdestitute@it brother,” and it is written there, “For he is @ITa poor man,@it etc.” @p1[10]@p2<TIE>Even if you merely say that you would give, etc.@bo Since the word @hh<HEB>הדבר@it<ENG> (this thing) is written, they expounded it as being related to the word @hh<HEB>דיבור@it<ENG> (speech). Likewise the verse (Bereishis 12:17), “Regarding the matter (@hh<HEB>דבר@it<ENG>) of Sarah,” is expounded as, “Through Sarah’s speech.” Otherwise, why is the term, “this thing,” needed? Rather it should simply say, “Because of this, Adonoy will bless you.” @p1[11]@p2<TIE>For this reason.@bo I.e., the term @hh<HEB>על כן@it<ENG> does not mean, “since,” as in, “Since (@hh<HEB>כי על כן@it<ENG>) I did not give her to Shailoh my son (Bereishis 38:26),” and, “Since (@hh<HEB>כי על כן@it<ENG>) I did not allow you to touch her (ibid. 20:6).” For in those verses, the expression @hh<HEB>על כן@it<ENG> is connected to the word @hh<HEB>כי@it<ENG> — and every instance of @hh<HEB>כי על כן@it<ENG> in Scripture means, “since,” as Rashi explains in Parshas Vayeirah (ibid. 18:5). But here the expression @hh<HEB>על כן@it<ENG> means, “For this reason,” because it is written without the word @hh<HEB>כי@it<ENG>. @d1I am counselling you for your own good.@bo Otherwise, why is the word, “saying,” needed? For no form of the word @hh<HEB>דיבור@it<ENG> (spoke) is mentioned beforehand so that the word, “saying,” should follow it. @p1[12]@p2<TIE>When the courts sold him for his larceny, etc.@bo You might ask: From where does Rashi know this? Perhaps he sold himself, similar to the verse (Vayikra 25:39) @hh<HEB>ונמכר לך@it<ENG> (And he is sold to you), where he sold himself. We cannot say that Rashi’s explanation is because it already says, “And he is sold to you,” regarding when he sold himself, and therefore the verse here is apparently redundant [and must be discussing a different case — when the courts sold him]. If so [we could say to the contrary], it already says, “If you purchase a Hebrew slave (Shmos 21:2),” regarding when he is sold by others — the courts [and then the verse here must be discussing a different case — when he sold himself]. @ITRe”m@it answers: Perhaps the expression, “And he is sold,” on its own means that he is sold by others. For the word @hh<HEB>נמכר@it<ENG> is the @ITnifal@it verb form, which usually means that a subject is acted upon by others. Except regarding the verse, “And he is sold,” it is first written, “When your brother becomes impoverished,” and continues to explain, “And he is sold.” Perforce, it means that he sold himself. But it seems to me that regarding a Hebrew slave we learn one verse from another: It is written here @hh<HEB>אחיך העברי@it<ENG> (Your brother-@ITJew@it), and it is written there @hh<HEB>עבד עברי@it<ENG> (@ITJewish@it slave) — just as in the verse there he was sold by others, so too here he was sold by others. @d1Rather, because of two novel teachings here, etc.@bo You might ask: Why does Rashi not state another novel teaching — that a Hebrew (male) slave is not set free if his master mutilates the tips of his limbs. For the verse here compares him to the Hebrew maidservant, [and she is not set free if mutilated] as it is written in Parshas Mishpatim (Shmos 21:7). Perhaps the answer is: The rule stated by our sages, “Any segment of the Torah which is written and repeated — it is only repeated for the sake of a novel teaching,” applies only to a novel teaching stated explicitly in the verse. But it does not apply to [something like] this, which is merely an outcome of the comparison [between the slave and maidservant] (@ITRe”m@it). But it seems to me: Regardless of the comparison here, we still would not learn that the Hebrew (male) servant is set free if mutilated. [This might have been attempted] through @ITa fortiori@it reasoning from a Canaanite slave [as follows]: Regarding a Canaanite slave, who is not set free after six years. Nevertheless he is set free if mutilated. So then regarding a Hebrew slave, who is set free after six years, does it not logically follow that he too is set free if mutilated? But I would retort: A Hebrew maidservant disproves this logic. For she is set free after six years, but she is not set free if mutilated, and so a Hebrew slave would be the same. We could not learn through @ITa fortiori@it reasoning from a Canaanite slave that a Hebrew maidservant is set free if mutilated, for Scripture writes explicitly that, “She shall not go out [free] in the manner of male slaves [if mutilated].” [It seems to me].<QC>
@p1[14]@p2<TIE>The literal meaning of this is “adornment.”@bo In other words: The master should adorn his slave lavishly, and this will indicate to the slave that his master treated him benevolently. @d1Just as these are distinguished by their blessed status, etc.@bo Flocks are [blessed because they] bear offspring and multiply. So, too, whatever grows from the earth. However, this excludes mules, since they do not bear offspring and multiply. @d1Also, the Rabbis derive in tractate Kiddushin through the @BIgezeirah-shava@BO comparison principle etc.@bo I.e., the verse here says, “Do not send him away @ITempty-handed@it,” and in Parshas Ki Sisa regarding a first-born son it says, “Do not appear before Me @ITempty-handed@it (Shmos 34:20).” Just as regarding a first-born son the amount is twenty silver pieces, here too the amount is twenty silver pieces. From where do we know the amount regarding the first-born? [We know] from Yoseif, the first-born son of Rochel, who was sold to Egypt for twenty silver pieces.<QC>
@p1[17]@p2<TIE>Perhaps this follows the plain meaning? Etc.@bo And we should not say: Perhaps this verse refers to a slave sold by the courts two or three years before the @ITyovel — @itHe goes free in the @ITyovel@it, but a slave who has been pierced should serve forever, which is the plain meaning of the verse. For the answer is: A slave sold by the courts is set free because the verse says, “And he shall return to his family (Vayikra 25:41).” If so, then what is the verse, “Everyone shall return to his family, etc. (Vayikra 25:10),” referring to? It must mean that a slave who has been pierced is set free in the @ITyovel@it. See Parshas Mishpatim (Shmos 21:6) and Parshas Behar (Vayikra ibid.).<QC>
@p1[18]@p2<TIE>His master gives him [a Gentile maidservant], etc.@bo I.e., The Hebrew slave may even be forced to take her. Otherwise [if the meaning is that he is merely @ITallowed@it to take her], it is already written (Shmos 21:4), “If his master gives him a [maidservant] wife, etc.” @p1[19]@p2<TIE>It is a @BImitzvah@BO to declare ‘You are hereby consecrated as a firstborn.’@bo Otherwise, why is @hh<HEB>תקדיש@it<ENG> (you must consecrate) necessary? For it is already consecrated. @d1Another interpretation. One cannot say, “You must consecrate”, etc.@bo The first interpretation is problematic: What is the @ITmitzvah@it to declare, “You are hereby consecrated,” if it is already consecrated? Therefore Rashi says, “Another interpretation, etc.” And the second interpretation is problematic: For the term @hh<HEB>תקדיש@it<ENG> (You must consecrate) implies that the animals itself must be consecrated, and not its monetary value. Therefore Rashi also says the first interpretation. This answers the question that is asked: Rashi’s second interpretation is the viewpoint of Rebbi Yishmael, but the first interpretation is the viewpoint of the Rabbis who argue with him, and the @IThalacha@it follows the Rabbis. Why then does Rashi mention the viewpoint of Rebbi Yishmael if the @IThalacha@it does not follow him? Perforce Rashi is only coming to explain the verse close to its simple meaning, and to set each matter in the verse properly. @d1Then donate, to the sacred @BIhekdesh@BO domain, the value of its beneficiary payment.@bo Re”m writes: Here Rashi explains, “Donate to @IThekdesh@it the value of its beneficiary payment.” But in tractate @ITErechin@it (29a) Rashi explains, “Donate to a@IT kohein@it the value of its beneficiary payment,” which is difficult to understand. Furthermore: In tractate @ITBechoros@it (31a) the Mishnah says, “The monetary benefit of sacred animals that have been disqualified is given to @IThekdesh@it. They may be sold in the market and weighed in the usual manner; except for the firstborn and (animal) tithes, since their monetary benefit is given to their owners [the Kohanim].” Yet how can Rashi say here that the beneficiary payment of the firstborn is given to @IThekdesh@it? I found [a solution] written, which I think is correct: Rashi’s explanation here, @hh<HEB>"@it<ENG>Then donate, to @IThekdesh@it, the value of its beneficiary payment,” is referring to a firstborn that was sanctified, for then its beneficiary payment is given to @IThekdesh@it. But there [in @ITErechin@it and @ITBechoros@it] is referring to a firstborn that was pledged, for all pledges are given to the Kohanim. Therefore Rashi explains there, “Give its beneficiary payment to the Kohanim.” See @ITErechin@it 28b, 29a. @p1[20]@p2<TIE>Just as the second tithe is not disqualified from one year to the next, etc.@bo As it is written regarding the tithes (above 14:28), “At the end of three years, separate all the tithes of your produce,” and Rashi explains, “This comes to teach that if one withheld his tithes, etc.”<QC>
@p1[2]@p2<TIE>You shall slaughter, as the @BIchagigah@BO-<FJ> offering, etc.@bo For the @ITpesach@it-offering may only be from the sheep or from the goats. @p1[3]@p2<TIE>Bread which memorializes the anguish, etc.@bo For in a brief moment they were all redeemed — their dough did not even have time to rise. And by [remembering] this miracle, they will [also] remember the anguish. @d1Without sufficient time for the dough to leaven, etc.@bo You might ask: Regardless they were not permitted to eat leaven, for it is written (Shmos 12:15), “Seven days you shall eat matzos, etc.” The answer is: “Seven days, etc.,” applies only to future generations. But in Egypt, leaven was forbidden only on that day, as mentioned in tractate @ITPesachim@it (28b, 96a). @p1[4]@p2<TIE>This prohibits retaining the flesh of the @BIpesach@BO offered during future generations, etc.@bo For regarding the @ITpesach@it brought in Egypt it is written (Shmos 12:10), “Do not let any of it remain until morning.” [Therefore] we might think that this applies only to the @ITpesach@it brought in Egypt, which the Jews ate in haste while preparing to travel. And for this reason it should not be allowed to remain — so there should be no delay. But the @ITpesach@it brought during future generations may remain until morning. So the verse here comes to teach us differently. And the verse in Parshas Ki Sisa (ibid. 34:25), “Do not allow to remain overnight until the morning, etc.,” is speaking about the innards of the @ITpesach@it offering. And the verse in Parshas Beha’aloscha (Bamidbar 9:12), “They shall not leave any of it over until the morning,” is speaking about the Second Pesach [on the fifteenth of Iyar]. @d1The “first day” mentioned here refers to the fourteenth of Nisan, etc.@bo [I.e., it should not be understood literally as “the first day” after slaughtering, which is the fifteenth.] The verse should be understood as, “Which you slaughtered on the first day — which is the fourteenth of Nisan.” And the phrase, “Until morning,” is connected to, “None of the flesh may remain overnight.” It is as if the verse says, “And none may remain overnight until morning from the flesh which you slaughtered towards the evening of the first day.”<QC>
@d1Because Scripture has digressed from matters concerning the @BIpesach@BO, etc.@bo I.e., if Scripture had not digressed then it would only need to say, “None of the flesh may remain overnight which you slaughtered towards the evening, until morning.” It would obviously be referring to the fourteenth day of Nisan, for right beforehand it is written, “You shall slaughter the @ITpesach@it-offering, etc.”<QC>
@p1[6]@p2<TIE>These are three separate times, etc.@bo It is as if the verse had written, “There you will slaughter the @ITpesach@it in the evening — which is after six hours, and eat it at sunset — which is night time, and burn it at the time you left Egypt.” But since it is not an obligation to burn it, therefore Rashi says, “Meaning that it is disqualified as @ITnosar@it and must be removed to the burning site.” @p1[7]@p2<TIE>The morning of the second day, etc.@bo “Morning,” cannot refer to the morning of the first day, for it is the Festival and one may not leave the city boundaries. Furthermore, one is obligated on the first day to [appear in the Beis Hamikdash and] bring @ITr’iyah@it burnt-offerings. Tosefos write this in Succah (47a).<QC>
@p1[8]@p2<TIE>Elsewhere it is said seven days.@bo See @ITRe”m@it for further elaboration. But I have previously stated that I do not mention whatever is not necessary for the simple understanding. @d1Seven from the old crop, six from the new.@bo For on the sixteenth of Nisan the @ITomer@it is brought, and that permits the new crop. But if one wishes to eat from the old crop all seven days, he is permitted [to do so]. @d1Another interpretation. This teaches that eating @BImatzoh@BO on the seventh day is not obligatory, etc.@bo This has been explained in Parshas Bo (Shmos 12:15), see there. @p1[9]@p2<TIE>From the time the @BIomer@BO is cut, etc.@bo I.e., it does not depend upon the beginning of the harvest, but rather upon the time the @ITomer@it is cut. But since the harvest begins with the @ITomer@it, Scripture writes, “From the time the sickle begins felling the standing grain.<HEB>" @p1<ENG>[10]@p2<TIE>The fullness of the gift of your hand, etc.@bo For the word above (15:8) @hh<HEB>די@it<ENG> (fullness) is translated by Onkelos as @hh<HEB>כמסת@it<ENG>. The letter @ITmem@it in @hh<HEB>מסת@it<ENG> is a root letter, and the full root is @hh<HEB>מסס@it<ENG>. The letter @ITsamech@it contains a @ITdagesh@it [dot] to make up for the missing double @ITsamech@it. @p1[13]@p2<TIE>Another interpretation .<TIE>.<TIE>. the @BIsukkah@BO should be covered with the husks and skins left in the threshing area and wine cellar.@bo The refuse of the threshing area is the husks, and the refuse of the wine cellar is the skins. [These come] to exclude anything that is attached to the ground or is susceptible to contract ritual impurity. The reason Rashi says, “Another interpretation, etc.” is because the simple meaning of the verse is problematic: Why does it need to say, “The festival of @ITSukkos@it,” and also, “When you harvest”? One or the other is sufficient. Therefore Rashi says, “Another interpretation, etc.” @p1[15]@p2<TIE>The last evening of the festival is included, etc.@bo As we learned in tractate Sukkah (48a): “You shall experience only joy,” includes the last evening of the festival [i.e., the eve of the eighth day]. Or perhaps it only includes the first evening of the festival? The Torah therefore says, “only,” in order to differentiate. Why do you see fit to include the last evening and to exclude the first evening? [The answer is:] I include the last evening because it is preceded by rejoicing — i.e. the festival. Therefore it must be included with the seven days. But this is not so regarding the first evening. @p1[16]@p2<TIE>Rather, bring @BIolah@BO-<FJ> pilgrimage-offerings, etc.@bo Although the commandment of, “Are all your males to be seen,” only refers to @ITolah@it-pilgrimage-offerings, Rashi needed also to explain, “Festive @ITshelamim@it-offerings.” For [in the next verse] it is written, “Everyone according to the gift appropriate to his means,” which refers to the above verse (v. 10), “To the fullness of your open-handed gift,” and there it is also written (v. 14), “You are to rejoice during your festival — you and your son, etc.” and this alludes to the festive @ITshelamim@it-offerings, for there is no rejoicing without [eating] meat.<QC>
@p1[18]@p2<TIE>By administering corporal punishment with cudgels, etc.@bo [Rashi specially defines this word] because we find @hh<HEB>שוטרים@it<ENG> [applied also] to those who are appointed in battle as [in the verse], “The officers (@hh<HEB>שוטרים@it<ENG>) will address” (below 20:5) which Onkelos translates as @hh<HEB>סרכיא@it<ENG> (officers) will address. @d1In each and every city.@bo Rashi is answering the question: If one has to appoint judges in each and every gate [of every house], if so who will they judge? They would all be judges! He answers, “In each and every city.” @d1This continues from “You shall appoint for yourself.” Judges, etc.@bo Because you cannot say that it [“for your tribes”] is connected with [the] adjacent [term] “giving you,” because once it says “that Adonoy, your God, is giving you,” the term “for your tribes” is included in the word “you.” [Therefore Rashi explains]: “This continues etc,” and it is as if the verse had written “@ITand@it in [all] your gates,” and the @hh<HEB>וי"ו@it<ENG> is missing from @hh<HEB>בכל שעריך@it<ENG>. Rashi further explains that if so, why write both terms, “in your gate” and, “for your tribes”? And he explains, “This teaches that judges are to be seated, etc.” @d1This teaches that judges are to be seated for each and every tribe, etc.@bo I.e. “for your tribes” teaches that if [the territory of] two tribes was located in one town, one needs judges for each tribe. “And in all your gates” teaches that if two towns [are located in the territory] of one tribe, one needs [to seat] judges in each town. You may ask, even if it [@hh<HEB>לשבטיך@it<ENG>] were not connected to @hh<HEB>תתן לך@it<ENG> (“appoint for yourself”), one could still explain the same way; because it is written @hh<HEB>נותן לך לשבטיך@it<ENG> (“giving you for your tribes”), @hh<HEB>לשבטיך@it<ENG> is connected to the adjacent @hh<HEB>לך@it<ENG> [and the verse means that @hh<HEB>לך@it<ENG> means @hh<HEB>לשבטיך@it<ENG>]? The answer is that regarding the @hh<HEB>לך@it<ENG> written next to @hh<HEB>נותן@it<ENG>, once the Torah writes there, “@hh<HEB>אשר ה' אלקיך נותן לך@it<ENG>  (that Adonoy, your God, is giving you)”, this includes all your tribes [and if so] the original question returns, why does one need [the word] @hh<HEB>לשבטיך@it<ENG> (for your tribes)? But [when the Torah writes ]@hh<HEB>תתן לך@it<ENG> (“you shall appoint”), it is as if it wrote @hh<HEB>תתן לשבטיך@it<ENG> (you shall appoint for your tribes), and the word @hh<HEB>לך@it<ENG> written in the verse is similar to [the @hh<HEB>לך@it<ENG>] of “@hh<HEB>לך לך@it<ENG> (Go from your land) (Breishis 12:1),” and like “@hh<HEB>עשה לך@it<ENG> (make) (Ibid 6:14),” where (@hh<HEB>לך@it<ENG> is) a grammatical formality [and does not really imply anything]. The same also applies here. But regarding @hh<HEB>לך@it<ENG> written next to @hh<HEB>נותן@it<ENG>, the word @hh<HEB>לך@it<ENG> refers to the entire Jewish people and is not a grammatical formality; rather, it is an explanation of @hh<HEB>נותן@it<ENG>. Because it is written, “That Adonoy your God is giving,” and to whom is He giving? To “you,” and it is explaining that this [you] is the Jewish people. Because one cannot say that “He is giving to your tribes” [because] was the land given to the tribes [and not to individuals]? But regarding @hh<HEB>תתן לך@it<ENG>, once @hh<HEB>לשבטך@it<ENG> is connected with @hh<HEB>תתן@it<ENG> we no longer need the explanation of [the word @hh<HEB>לך@it<ENG>] and perforce it is a grammatical formality. @d1Appoint competent, righteous judges, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Scripture should have said, “And @ITyou@it shall judge the people righteous justice” as a direct command, just as afterwards it writes as a direct command, “Do not pervert justice,” “Do not show favoritism,” “Do not accept bribery.” And he answers, “Appoint, etc.” I.e. “Judges and police officers you shall appoint for yourself, etc.,” and what sort of judges should you appoint? The verse explains, “Who will judge the people righteous justice.” I.e. this is a command to Yisroel that they should appoint judges who know how to judge righteously, that they must be expert and righteous. @p1[19]@p2<TIE>Not even during the arguments, etc.@bo I.e. since [Rashi said that] @hh<HEB>לא תטה משפט@it<ENG> is [interpreted] “according to its obvious interpretation,” meaning that one should not pervert justice, if so, why do we need [the command], “Do not show favoritism”? He answers, to teach you “not even during the arguments, etc.” I.e. even before the [actual] judgment [begins], one should not pervert justice and not ruin [it], “he should not be gentle, etc.” Therefore Rashi also had to explain that “Do not pervert justice” follows the obvious interpretation. @d1Even to adjudicate fairly.@bo Because one cannot explain [that one should not take bribery] in order to @ITnot@it adjudicate fairly, [because] it is already written, “Do not pervert justice,” and if so, why do I need [the command], “Do not accept bribery”? Therefore [it must mean] that it is forbidden to take bribery even to adjudicate fairly. Alternatively, Rashi himself goes on to explain [his rationale]. I.e. the verse “for bribery blinds” is the reason for “Do not accept bribery.” And the explanation of this is that “once he has accepted his bribe it is impossible for him not to be partial, and subvert the verdict in his favor,” because he only took bribery from him in the first place in order to rule in his favor and to pervert the justice of his opponent. Therefore this implies, “‘Do not accept bribery,’ even to adjudicate fairly.” @d1Once he has accepted his bribe, it is impossible for him not to be partial, etc.@bo You might ask that in @ITparshas@it Mishpatim (Shmos 23:8), Rashi explained [differently], that “For it blinds the clear-sighted,” [means that] even if he is wise in the Torah but he takes a bribe, his mind will ultimately become muddled, etc.” The answer is that there it is written “blinds the clear-sighted,” and that certainly refers to his clear-sightedness, i.e. his clear-sightedness will be blinded because his mind will become muddled, etc. @d1Words that are justified, true justice.@bo I.e. it [the term @hh<HEB>צדיקים@it<ENG>] does not refer to the judges, but to the Torah which is [composed of] words that are justified and are called truth, and those words of the Torah he perverts because he fails to rule according to Torah law. The word @hh<HEB>דברי@it<ENG> has the same meaning as @hh<HEB>דברים@it<ENG> and it is not that @hh<HEB>דברי@it<ENG> is juxtaposed [to @hh<HEB>צדיקים@it<ENG> and means “words of the righteous”]. Rather, it is similar to “@hh<HEB>חלוני שקופים@it<ENG> (transparent windows) (Melochim I 6:4)” which is the same as [if it said] @hh<HEB>חלונים@it<ENG>, [and it is similar to] @hh<HEB>נטעי נעמנים@it<ENG>, “beautiful plants” (Yeshayah 17:10), which is the same [as if it said] @hh<HEB>נטעים@it<ENG>. @p1[20]@p2<TIE>Follow after the pre-eminent tribunal.@bo Explanation: even though any tribunal can judge a defendant against his will, nevertheless, it is a mitzvah for the claimant to go after a pre-eminent tribunal. Because you cannot define [the verse] according to its simple meaning [that the judges must pursue justice], because if so it should have said “judge [absolute justice].” Also, why is @hh<HEB>צדק@it<ENG> written twice, [whereas now the verse means, pursue justice that is righteous]. And also it is already written, “Do not pervert justice.” Rather, “Go after, etc.” @d1There is adequate merit in the appointment of ethical judges, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: “Pursue absolute justice,” [meaning] follow after the pre-eminent tribunal, is commanded only to someone who has litigation with his fellow, so just for this the entire nation of Yisroel will [merit to] live and inherit the land?! He answers that “so that you may live” does not refer to “Pursue absolute justice” but to “Judges and police officers you shall appoint for yourself, etc.” @p1[21]@p2<TIE>This makes him liable from the time that it was planted, etc.@bo Otherwise [its worship] would be included in [the command], “You must not have any other gods” (Shmos 20:3). Furthermore, why does Scripture make mention of planting? Therefore [perforce], “This makes him liable, etc.” @d1This prohibits planting a tree, etc.@bo Even though the verse does not write, “Do not plant for yourself any tree near the altar,” nevertheless, we are forced to say that “Do not plant” also refers [separately] to “any tree,” because if not, you might ask, how is it that Scripture writes, “Do not plant an @ITAsherah@it for yourself any tree near the altar”? Is serving idolatry only forbidden next to the altar and permitted when not next to the altar? Rather, this is what the verse is saying. “Do not plant an @ITAsherah@it for yourself” at all in the entire world. “And do not plant for yourself any tree near the altar” specifically, but not next to the altar you are permitted. @d1Or building a structure on the Temple mount.@bo @ITRe”m@it writes, “This is only a Rabbinic inference [which is hinted in the verse] as Scripture does not explicitly write “Do not plant for yourself any tree” but only the word tree [without a verb attached to it; and @hh<HEB>עץ@it<ENG> can also mean plank]; [this indicates that] it makes no difference [whether this is done] through planting or through building. However, according to the plain meaning of the verse it refers only to planting, because “Do not plant” in the verse refers to both of them, either [planting] an @ITAsherah@it [anywhere] or [planting] any tree near the altar of Adonoy.” Also, I found that in @ITparshas@it Balak (Bamidbar 24:6), Rashi comments on the verse “@hh<HEB>כאהלים נטע ה'@it<ENG> (like the tents Hashem stretched taut),” and that, “The expression of @hh<HEB>נטיעה@it<ENG> is found in relation to tents as it is written, “@hh<HEB>ויטע אהלו אפדנו@it<ENG> (he stretched taut his palatial tents) (Doniel 11:45).” Here too, [we can say that] the expression @hh<HEB>נטיעה@it<ENG> relates to a structure. Another answer is that we include the building of a structure because it is written [the seemingly extra word] “@ITany@it,” which comes to include even the building a structure. @p1[22]@p2<TIE>For sacrificial offerings, even for the sake of Heaven.@bo Rashi’s proof is that it is written, “That Adonoy, your God, detests” [in the present tense]. This implies that originally it was pleasant in His eyes when people erected a monument, but now He detests it. But if [the verse only forbade the erection of a monument] to sacrifice upon it for the purpose of idolatry, He would have hated it @IToriginally@it as well. @d1An earthen altar is what He commanded, but He detests this.@bo And the explanation of “that He detests” is, that it is detested now by “Adonoy your God.” But do not explain that “Adonoy… detests” means to not erect @ITthat@it [detested] monument, whereas a monument that Hashem does not detest you may erect. That is incorrect because Hashem detests all monuments as Rashi goes on to explain. @d1Because it was in the canon of the Canaanites, etc.@bo You might ask that for this same reason altars too should be forbidden, because altars too are included in the canon of the Canaanites as it is written above in @ITparshas@it Re’ey (12:3), “You are to break apart their altars”!@BO@bo The answer is that this is why Rashi writes, “Since they included it in the idolatrous ritual,” meaning that there is no idol in the world for which they would not make a pillar (@hh<HEB>מצבה@it<ENG>) [and] therefore Hashem hates them, but the altars are not such a [strict] canon as they did not make altars for all idols. Therefore the Holy One does not hate them. (@ITRe”m@it) @p1[1]@p2<TIE>This prohibits causing the @BIpigul@BO disqualification of the sacred offerings through a pernicious statement, etc.@bo Because you cannot say that [this part of the verse] is coming to prohibit [an offering that has] a blemish, since it is explicitly written, “that has a blemish.” He resolves [this problem by saying], “This prohibits, etc. through a pernicious statement.” I.e. above in @ITsefer@it Vayikra (7:18) and in @ITparshas@it Kedoshim (Vayikra 19:8), it is written that one is forbidden to eat @ITpigul,@it but it does not specify whether the person who made it @ITpigul@it had committed a transgression. Therefore it says here, “Do not sacrifice, etc. any bad thing,” to teach you that it is] prohibited to make offerings @ITpigul,@it i.e. if a person has in mind at the time of slaughtering to eat it beyond its [prescribed] time or outside its [prescribed] place which is accomplished by a pernicious statement. @p1[3]@p2<TIE>To worship them.@bo Rashi is answering the question: The verse implies that the Holy One Blessed Is He did not command that they should be in the world [and] if so they must be deities because [the verse implies that] they were created against His will; but this is not so! Therefore he explains, “To worship them,” i.e., I did not command to worship [them]. @p1[4]@p2<TIE>The testimony was consistent.@bo Rashi is wants to make clear that you should not mistakenly explain that the verse means, “If in fact the report is authenticated and accurate” in reference to [his] idolatry. I.e. it is authenticated that he served idolatry. Therefore he explains, “The testimony was consistent, i.e., consistent in the mouths of the witnesses when you interrogated [them]. @p1[5]@p2<TIE>“Your gates” is said below.@bo I.e. @hh<HEB>שעריך@it<ENG>, “your gates” written here [in this verse]. @d1And “your gates” is said above, etc.@bo Because it is written (v. 2), “If there is found among you, in one of your cities (@hh<HEB>שעריך@it<ENG>).” Just as there it is the city in which he worshipped, so too [over here, it means to take him] to the city in which he worshipped. @d1Targum [Onkelos] renders @HB<HEB>לקרוך@BO<ENG>.@bo Meaning, “to your city.” [Rashi mentions this so that] you should not explain [that it means] @hh<HEB>לתרעך@it<ENG>, “to your gates,” as the Targum translates, “On the doorposts of your house, and on your @ITgateposts@it (@hh<HEB>ובשעריך@it<ENG>) (above 6:9).”<QC>
@p1[6]@p2<TIE>None are liable as “conspiring witnesses” unless all are convicted as conspirators.@bo You might ask, why does Rashi write, “@ITAnd@it none are liable, etc.”? He should have written, “@ITHence@it none are liable, etc.,” because he is explaining what came before! The answer is that this is what Rashi means: Just as two “comprise a single testimony entity” and if one of them was found to be a relative or personally disqualified, their testimony [of both] is disqualified, so too, three “comprise a single testimony entity” and if one of them was found to be a relative or personally disqualified, their whole testimony is disqualified. [Rashi then concludes:] @ITAnd@it also, “none are liable as conspiring witnesses unless all are convicted as conspirators.” I.e., just as two are not liable as conspiring witnesses until they are both found liable, so too, three are not liable as conspiring witnesses until all three of them are found liable. @p1[8]@p2<TIE>The matter is separated and concealed from you.@bo@it You might ask why Rashi seemingly repeats himself? The answer is that first he explains that it [@hh<HEB>יפלא@it<ENG>] denotes “separation or setting apart” because anything hidden and covered from a person is separated and set apart from him. Afterwards he repeats, “The matter is separated, etc.,” because @hh<HEB>כי יפלא ממך@it<ENG> actually means that it is hidden and covered from him. Therefore [in the second sentence] Rashi [repeats the meaning of @hh<HEB>יפלא@it<ENG>] from [its actual] meaning to [its related] meaning. @d1One finding that it is unclean, the other that it is clean.@bo Rashi means that when Scripture writes “between blood and blood, etc.,” [it means that] they know nothing at all; rather, [the law] is separated and covered from them. But when it is written “matters under dispute,” they know [to some extent], except that “one finds that it is unclean, the other that it is clean.” Otherwise how is it written, “If a matter of law is too abstruse,” which implies that it is covered from them and they know nothing at all, and then write “matters under dispute,” which implies that “one finds that it is clean, the other that it is unclean, etc.” (In the name of Maharitz). @ITRe”m@it explains that the difference between the doubt [argument] over here and between [the earlier statement], “If a matter of law is too abstruse, etc. between blood and blood,” is that there the doubt involved the blood itself, whether it was clean or unclean, or if the plaintiff is not guilty or guilty. But here the doubt involves the words of the city’s wise men, that one rules “not guilty” and one rules “guilty” [and the doubt revolves] upon whom to rely. Alternatively, the verse first makes a general statement, “If a matter of law is too abstruse, etc.,” and then it explains, “Matters under dispute etc,” one finding that it is clean, the other that it is unclean, etc. @d1This teaches that the Beis Hamikdosh was loftier than all other places.@bo Meaning [that it was higher] than all other places in other countries, but excluding Eretz Yisoel where Ein Eitam was higher, as Rashi explains below (33:12) on the verse, “And He resides between his shoulders. (Tosafos in Sanhedrin 87a). @p1[9]@p2<TIE>Even if he is not comparable to other judges.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Is it then possible for a person to go to a judge who is not [officiating] “during those days?” Rather, it comes to teach “even if he is not comparable,” etc. @p1[11]@p2<TIE>Even if he tells you that right is left, etc.@bo It seems that Rashi means as follows: Even if he tells you that what you consider right is left and that what you consider left is right you should listen to him and blame the mistake not on him but on yourself, because Hashem always places His Spirit on those who serve in His sanctuary; and He guards them from any error so that only truth comes out from their mouths. You might ask: How does Rashi know to expound [the verse] this way? Perhaps [it should be understood] according to its obvious meaning that one should not deviate from that word either right or left! The answer is that since the “word” is an intellectual matter, right or left is not relevant to it. Therefore they expound what they expound.<QC>
@p1[13]@p2<TIE>From here it is derived that we wait with him until the festival, etc.@bo You might ask: What is the difference here that Rashi explains, “From here it is derived that we wait with him until the festival etc,” whereas regarding the wayward and rebellious son (later 21:21) Rashi explains, “‘Let all Yisroel hear and be fearful,’ from here [we derive] that there must be a proclamation at the courthouse, etc.,” see there. @ITRe”m@it discusses this at length and writes in the end: But you might ask that here we derive from “Let all the people hear and fear” that one needs waiting and a proclamation, whereas regarding the wayward and rebellious son they derive from the verse, “Let all Yisroel, etc.,” only that there must be a proclamation without [requiring] waiting? Furthermore, from where do we derive here [the requirement of] waiting? It is written here, “Let all the people @ITsee@it and fear”? It is written “@IThear@it and fear,” which indicates only hearing. Research this in the commentaries. @p1[16]@p2<TIE>Except as required for his riding entourage, etc.@bo Because it is written “for himself,” this implies that he may not acquire for himself an abundance of horses just to stand idly by [i.e., without purpose]. But what is required for his needs is permitted, i.e. “as required for his riding entourage.” @d1The source of supply for horses, etc.@bo And since horses come from there, the king would certainly send his servants there so that they should always be there in order to send quality horses. And this would result in them returning to Egypt and dwelling there. You might ask Smag’s question regarding the many Jewish communities that dwell there, etc. He discusses this at length and answers in the name of R. Eliezer of Metz that when the Torah said, “You are not to proceed to return along this route again,” the Torah only forbade @ITthis@it route, i.e. from Eretz Yisroel to Egypt, but from other countries it is permitted. This is correct. @p1[17]@p2<TIE>Except as required to maintain his retinue.@bo Because it is written “for himself.” This implies that he may not accumulate in abundance for himself when he [merely] wants to put it into his treasury. “Except as required to maintain his retinue” means supplying his soldiers and horseman [and] to his servants with food, drink and clothing and all that they need.<QC>
@p1[18]@p2<TIE>If he fulfills this, then he is worthy of [his kingdom] enduring.@bo Otherwise, why is [the phrase] “that when he occupies” necessary? It should have [merely] written, “He must write for himself a duplicate of this Torah, etc.,” because before this he is certainly not any more obligated [to write a Torah scroll] than other Jews. Therefore it must be connected to what is written above [and means] that the Torah is informing him that if he fulfills this [i.e. these commands], his kingdom will endure. @p1[19]@p2<TIE>This follows the plain meaning.@bo Rashi has to explain that this follows the plain meaning because afterwards he explains that “and he does not stray from the commandment” means “even an easily fulfilled directive by a prophet.” However, if “all the words of this Torah” did not follow the plain meaning, you might have thought that “and he does not stray from the commandment” refers to the actual words of Torah. @d1Implicit in the positive is the negative, etc.@bo Meaning, that it is from here that Shmuel the prophet learned that one who contravenes the directive of a prophet, the days of his reign will not endure for long. And [therefore] he said to Shaul, “You have been foolish! You have not kept, etc.”<QC>
@p1[1]@p2<TIE>Whether physically sound or blemished.@bo Otherwise, why does the Torah write “the @ITentire@it tribe of Levi” after it had written “the @ITkohanim,@it the Levites” beforehand? Therefore this must be to include “whether physically sound, etc.” You might ask: Why does one need to exclude the blemished [from inheritance]? Above in @ITparshas@it Tzav (Vayikra 6:11) it is written, “Every male descendant of Aharon may eat it,” and Rashi explains, “‘Every male,’ and even the blemished, etc.” i.e., they too receive portion in the sacrifices. And [if so], it is obvious that they are excluded from inheritance because they are given a portion in the offerings for this [very] reason. The answer is that the owners of extra-Sanctuary items such as @ITterumah@it and @ITbikkurim,@it the firstborn, @ITchallah,@it and the forelimb, etc. have @ITtovas hano’ah@it in their offerings, i.e. they can give them to any @ITkohein@it they choose, and they usually give these items to physically sound @ITkohanim@it who can perform the sacrificial service and not to blemished @ITkohanim@it who are not able to perform the sacrificial service. Therefore one might have thought that they take a portion in the land, and because of this one needs a [Scriptural] exclusion. @d1This refers to the extra-Sanctuary sacred items, etc.@bo I.e. sanctified items brought from the outside. And what are they? Rashi explains, “The @ITterumah@it-gifts and the tithes.” @p1[2]@p2<TIE>This refers to the inheritance of the remaining ones.@bo Because the Torah already said at the beginning, “They will not have, the @ITkohanim@it etc. a portion or an inheritance, etc.,” and they [the Sifrei cited by Rashi] explained, “an inheritance,” refers to a portion in the inheritance of the Land, [the Sifrei] is forced to expound regarding this verse, “But he will have no territory,” [that] “this refers to the inheritance of the remaining ones, etc.” But Rashi who explains “but he will have no territory” according to its plain meaning, [that “they did not receive a complete inheritance”], opines that even though the Torah began [by saying], “They will not have — the @ITkohanim@it etc. a portion, etc.,” it repeats it and concludes with this [same statement]. (@ITRe”m@it) @d1“And the inheritance of the remaining ones” adds that of the Keinites.@bo Rashi explains: The Holy One Blessed Is He, promised Avraham that He would give his seed ten nations. He gave them seven now, and in the future he will give them the Keini, Kenizi, and Kadmoni. @d1“But he will have no territory” — this refers to the inheritance of five, etc.@bo Rabbeinu Tam explains that there are five brothers from the same mother, Reuven, Shimon, Yehudah, Yissachar, Zevulun; [and] because they come from the same mother, one needs an extra exclusion [to prevent the Levites from having a portion in the Land]. @p1[3]@p2<TIE>But not from the @BIkohanim.@bo @ITKohanim@it are exempt from having to give the gifts from their animals to another @ITkohein.@it There is an uncertainty whether Levites are included in “the people” and [therefore we apply the rule that] the burden of proof is upon the person who wants to remove something from his fellow. Therefore they are exempt from giving but if people took [these gifts from them], they do not have to return [them]. @d1This excludes wild animals.@bo Otherwise, the verse should have said @hh<HEB>בהמה@it<ENG> (animal) without specifying, and that would have implied everything, whether an ox or a sheep. [And the reason why the verse specifies] Rashi explains [that] if Scripture had written “animal” without specifying, it would have implied a wild animal as well because a @hh<HEB>חיה@it<ENG> (wild animal) is included in the word @hh<HEB>בהמה@it<ENG> (animal). Therefore the verse says, “Whether an ox or a sheep,” [because] “This excludes wild animals.” @d1From the carpus to the shoulder blade, @BIespaldon@BO in Old French.@bo And @ITshoivil@it in German. @d1Including the tongue.@bo Otherwise, why would the @ITkohein@it want the bone of the jaw? But certainly it is together with the tongue. Also, it seems to that since the jaw is given as a representation of prayer as Rashi explains, we therefore also give the tongue which is the main organ of speech. @d1Those expounding Scriptural selections.@bo [I.e.] the meaning of the written verses (Bava Kama 82a). @d1The foreleg represents the hand, etc.@bo Meaning, the @ITkohanim@it merited [to receive] the foreleg which represents the hand of Pinchas as it says, “And he took, etc.” @p1[4]@p2<TIE>One sixth of an @BIeiphah@BO (@HB<HEB>וששיתם האיפה@BO<ENG>).@bo This denotes a sixth. @d1From a @BIchomer.@bo I.e. a @ITkur.@it @d1Now one sixth of an @BIeiphah@BO is half a @BIse’ah.@BO etc.@bo Because an @ITeiphah@it is three @ITse’ah@it and it is written, “Give one sixth of an @ITeiphah@it from a @ITchomer@it of barley,” which means you should separate a sixth of an @ITeiphah@it from a @ITkur,@it which is half a @ITse’ah@it for thirty @ITse’as.@it Thus one has to separate one sixtieth. @d1When you shear your sheep every year etc.@bo [It does] not [mean] that you should give the entire shearing of the first year to the @ITkohein,@it and the shearing of all subsequent years are to be exempt.<QC>
@d1As it is said, “Five sheep which cause etc.”@bo I.e., [you are obligated] when you have five sheep @hh<HEB>עשויות@it<ENG> (which cause). What does @hh<HEB>עשויות@it<ENG> mean? That they are @hh<HEB>מעשות@it<ENG> (cause), i.e. they obligate their owners and say, “Rise up and do the mitzvah!” (Chullin 137a) And what mitzvah is the verse referring to? You cannot say the mitzvah of the first-born because one is obligated regarding the first-born even when he has only one animal. You also cannot say that it refers to the gifts [of the forearm, etc.] that one gives to a @ITkohein,@it etc. because one is obligated regarding the gifts even when he has only one animal. Perforce, it is referring to the first shearing. @p1[6]@p2<TIE>Perhaps it is literally to the Levite that Scripture refers?, etc.@bo I.e. an actual descendant of Levi, to exclude a @ITkohein@it. Or perhaps the verse includes a @ITkohein@it also, because a @ITkohein@it is also a descendant of Levi? [In proof of this latter suggestion] the Torah therefore teaches, “He shall perform the service,”, etc.<QC>
@p1[7]@p2<TIE>This teaches, concerning the @BIkohein,@BO that he is permitted to come and offer up, etc.@bo Because this is implied in the word “with all his soul’s @ITdesire@it,” which means that he wants to offer up with his soul’s desire and not because of the obligation of his ministering watch. @d1Another interpretation. This teaches, further, etc.@bo The first interpretation is problematic might why it says “to the place that Adonoy chooses,” [a term normally mentioned in connection with coming up to Yerusholayim on the festivals]. It should have only said “to the altar that is before Adonoy and he shall serve, etc.” And the second interpretation is problematic why it says “with all his soul’s desire.” Therefore we also need the first interpretation that “all his soul’s desire” refers to his personal vows and voluntary sacrifices, because he vows and volunteers out of his soul’s desire. @d1[Were permitted] to bring offerings with the ministering watch, by performing the sacrificial services, etc.@bo Otherwise, why does it say “like all his brother Levites”? It should only have said, “He shall come and serve with all his soul’s desire.” Therefore the verse must be referring to @ITkohanim@it who come for a festival [and is saying] that they offer sacrifices like all their brothers who belong to the ministering watch. @d1Which were brought because of the festival obligation — for example, the festival @BImusaf@BO-offerings, etc.@bo Below (v. 8) I will explain that [this applies] only to @ITmusaf@it-offering of festivals that come because of the festival, and not to things which do not pertain to the festival. @p1[8]@p2<TIE>That they share in the skins and in the flesh of the sin-offering goats, etc.@bo Rashi mentions specifically skins and flesh of the sin-offering goats because [visiting] @ITkohanim@it only have a portion in the @ITmusaf@it-offerings of the festivals, and these @ITmusaf@it-offerings are burnt offerings and sin-offering goats as it says in @ITparshas@it Pinchas. And they offer up the burnt offerings completely to Hashem and the @ITkohanim@it receive only their skins. But [regarding] the sin-offering goats, the @ITkohein@it receives [their skins and also] their meat after the burnt portions have been offered up. @p1[10]@p2<TIE>The Rabbis said that this refers to sleight of hand magicians.@bo Rashi (Sanhedrin 65b) explains, “He seizes and closes people’s eyes by showing them as if he is doing miraculous things and [actually] he does nothing.” @p1[11]@p2<TIE>Someone who conjures up [the dead] onto his male organ.@bo I.e. he conjures up the dead onto his male organ and it speaks there. @d1Or communicates with a skull.@bo I.e., with a skull from a corpse lying on the ground. And through magic it answers what one asks it. So Sifrei expounds it. But in @ITPerek Arba Misos@it (ibid) it is taught in a Beraisa: “Ov” is someone who conjures up onto his male organ or communicates with a skull, and “communicates with the dead” is someone who abstains from food and spends the night in a cemetery. One can explain why Rashi cites Sifrei and ignores our Talmud is because it [i.e., Sifrei] is closer to the verse’s plain meaning. @p1[13]@p2<TIE>Walk with Him in utter trust, in anticipation of Him, etc.@bo I.e., do not do like the idolaters [who explore the future], but “walk in perfect trust,” [meaning] that “you should walk with Him in utter trust, in anticipation of Him, etc.” @d1Then, you will be with Him, [He will take you] as His portion.@bo This is how you should explain the verse: “Walk in perfect trust,” meaning that you should “wait for Him and you should not explore the future, etc.,” and then [you will be] “with Adonoy, your God.” I.e., “you will be with Him and as His portion.” @p1[14]@p2<TIE>Whereby they listen to auguries or sorcerers, etc.@bo Rashi means to say: Do not ask that the plain meaning of the verse, “Adonoy, your God, has not given you so,” implies that Hashem had already commanded them earlier that there should be no sorcerers, auguries and magicians among them, yet, where do we find that He commanded this? Rashi answers that He did command earlier that there should be no sorcerers and auguries, for this is why he rested His Divine Presence on the prophets so that you should listen to the prophets. The reason Rashi says “the Holy One Blessed Is He” and not “Adonoy, your God” [note that this phrase “the Holy One Blessed Is He” is missing in our version of Rashi’s text] is to indicate that the verse here did not have to mention “your God” which always indicates the giving of a reason, that He is your God and He is the possessor of power and authority Who brought you to the Land, as in the verse, “Walk in perfect trust with Adonoy, your God (v. 13),” because since I am your God it is fitting to make an effort to be with Me and to cleave to Me. But here where it is only relating facts there is no need to add “your God” but only “Adonoy,” as in the verse, "See, Adonoy has designated by name [etc.] (Shmos 35:30),” and many others like it. And the reason Rashi does not mention the “Adonoy” [as it appears in the verse but writes instead “the Holy One Blessed Is He”] is so that we do not think he wrote briefly. (@ITRe”m@it) @p1[15]@p2<TIE>Just as I from your midst, etc.@bo The question is: [How can the verse say “like me” when] it is written (Devarim 34:10), “There has not ever arisen a prophet within Yisroel like Moshe”? Therefore he explains [that the verse means], “Just as I am in your midst and of your brethren.” @d1Similarly, from prophet to prophet.@bo Meaning in order that the verse should not be misunderstood that it is speaking about a specific prophet who will arise after Moshe in the future, as the heretics explained, Rashi adds and says, “Similarly from prophet to prophet” [i.e., continuously]. His proof is that the [verse’s] intent is to distant people from auguries and sorcerers and it is saying that you do not need auguries and sorcerers because there will always be prophets from your midst in every generation so that you will not need auguries.<QC>
@p1[20]@p2<TIE>Someone who fabricates a prophetic message he did not hear etc., and one who prophesies in the name of an idol.@bo Because it is written, “That I did not instruct him to say,” i.e. what he did not hear. And because it is written “that I did not instruct @IThim,@it” which implies that I did instruct his fellow [prophet]. “And one who prophesies in the name of an idol” for it is explicitly written, “or who speaks in the name of foreign gods.” @d1However, one who withholds his prophecy, etc.@bo “One who withholds his prophecy” is derived from (v. 19), “@hh<HEB>אשר לא ישמע@it<ENG> (who does not heed My words),” which can be read as @hh<HEB>אשר לא ישמיע@it<ENG> (“who does not announce My words”), i.e., “one who withholds his prophecy.” And “one who violates a prophet’s instructions,” whether he himself or other people, is derived from (ibid), “Who does not heed My words that he speaks in My Name,” whether he himself or other people. And it is written (ibid), “I shall prosecute [the matter] with him,” which means by Heavenly execution. @p1[21]@p2<TIE>You are destined to say this.@bo Because the word @hh<HEB>וכי@it<ENG> always refers to a future [event], [something] that will happen, such as (Shmos 21:20) “@hh<HEB>וכי יכה איש@it<ENG> (if a man strikes)” which means when he will strike. And similarly (Ibid., v. 28) “@hh<HEB>כי יגח שור@it<ENG> (when an ox gores),”@BO@bo and the same [holds true] in similar cases. @d1While Yirmiyahu will stand and cry out, etc.@bo Meaning, he will say the opposite [i.e., that more exile will follow]. @d1Concerning the columns and the basin, etc.@bo I.e., the basin that Shlomo made.<QC>
@p1[22]@p2<TIE>And you observe that it does not occur, etc.@bo As in the case of Chananyah ben Azor, because afterwards the rest of the vessels were transported to Babylon with the exile of Zidkiyahu. @d1But you may ask, this applies with a prophet who foretells the future, etc.@bo I.e., this test applies if he prophesies about future events, as in the case of Chananyah ben Azor. But if he came and said, “Do so and so and I am speaking from Hashem’s mouth,” in such a case how can we know that He did not speak? Rashi explains, regarding this, “We have already, etc. @d1If he attempts to divert you from any one of the commandments, do not listen to him, etc.@bo And if he does not attempt to divert you, it does not matter if you listen to him. @d1This is why it is stated, “You shall obey him.”@bo I.e., if in your estimation he is established and a perfect saint.<QC>
@d1Do not fear punishment because of him.@bo Because Rashi in @ITparshas@it Devarim (above 1:17) gives two explanations of @hh<HEB>לא תגורו@it<ENG>, that it means either fear or gathering in [i.e. refraining], therefore he mentions these two meanings [here]. (In the name of Maharitz). @ITRe”m@it explains that Rashi writes “Do not fear punishment because of him” after saying “Do not refrain from finding him guilty,” because it provides a rationale for [observing the command] “Do not refrain, etc.” It is as if the verse said, “Do not refrain, etc. and do not fear punishment because of this.” @p1[3]@p2<TIE>At every fork in the road.@bo So that he does not err at the fork in the road. @d1The distance from the border, etc.@bo You might ask that based to this division, the land would be divided into four sections! The answer is that the distance from the border until the second town of refuge is the same distance as from the first town until the last [town]. And from the second town until the second border is also the same as these distances. Therefore it is called “three sections.” I gave the same explanation in @ITparshas@it Terumah (Shmos 26:26) regarding the bars. It also explains in @ITPerek Eilu Hein Hagolin@it (Makkos 9b) [like Rashi here], that “divide into three sections” means that the land is divided into four sections along its breadth. See there.<QC>
@p1[6]@p2<TIE>This is why I am instructing you to ready [the route], etc.@bo Rashi means as follows: The verse seems to be saying, “He is to flee to one of these cities to survive, lest the blood-redeemer pursue etc.” But how will it help to flee? The blood-redeemer might still pursue him until the refuge city and catch him [before he reaches it] since his heart is heated? Therefore Rashi explains that this phrase is not connected with the adjacent “he is to flee, etc.” but to (v. 3) above where it is written, “Ready the route for yourself and divide the borders of your land into three sections,” which means that one must write “refuge,” “refuge” at every fork in the road and also, that one needs three refuge cities. Why? The verse explains, “Lest the blood-redeemer pursue, etc.” But now that there are many refuge cities and there it also written “refuge” at every fork in the road, the murderer can easily be saved so that the blood-redeemer will be unable to overtake him. @p1[8]@p2<TIE>In accordance with His oath to give you the land, etc.@bo Meaning that although Hashem promised to give Yisroel the [land of] the ten nations, He only gave Yisroel seven nations. He did not yet give the [land of the] Keini, Kenizi, and Kadmoni. However, in the future he will give [these three nations] as an inheritance [in order] to fulfill the oath [made to] the forefathers.<QC>
@p1[13]@p2<TIE>Do not say, the first one has already been killed.@bo Otherwise, why does the verse say, “Do not view him with compassion”? Would you think that any person will have compassion on someone who murdered deliberately after having been warned?<QC>
@p1[15]@p2<TIE>This establishes a source construct: Wherever “witness” is mentioned in the Torah, the reference is to two, etc.@bo You might ask: Perhaps this verse indicates that whenever “witness” is mentioned in the Torah the reference is to one, because just as here the Torah writes “witness” [in the singular form] and then writes “one” next to it, so everywhere else where it is written “witness” the reference is to one? The answer [in Sotah 2b] is that otherwise [if not as Rashi says], the verse should not have said “one” here because “witness” is singular, and once the Torah wrote “witness,” why write “one”? [Obviously, this is] to inform you that only here “witness” is the reference to “one,” but elsewhere when it writes “witness” without any specification, the reference is to two. You might ask: Why does [Rashi] not explain this above (17:10) on the verse, “He is not to be executed by the oral testimony of one witness”? Tosefos in the first chapter of Sotah (2b) already answered that the word “one” there comes to [teach something else. That we need] united testimony, and to exclude one [witness] seeing from this window and a second witness seeing from another window. Another answer [to the first question] is that one cannot expound the opposite, that wherever it says “witness” without specifying it means one, because if so, when it is written afterwards, “If a false witness (@hh<HEB>עד@it<ENG>) arises against a man, etc. And behold, the witness testified falsely, etc.,” this too would mean one witness. But this cannot be, because it is written afterwards, “You are to do to him as he conspired to do to his brother.” Yet [how could one witness have conspired, for] above it is written, “One witness may not arise, etc.” Then perforce, wherever “witness” is mentioned, the reference is to two, etc. This answers why Rashi did not explain this above (17:10) on the verse, “He is not to be executed by the oral testimony of one witness.” Because you can say that above one might have said the opposite, but here you cannot say the opposite as I have explained. Analyze this well. @d1To have his fellow penalized, etc.@bo The meaning is as if the verse had said, “One witness may not arise against a man” to penalize him with any punishment (@hh<HEB>עון@it<ENG>) [or] with any sacrifice (@hh<HEB>חטאת@it<ENG>). @hh<HEB>עון@it<ENG> means punishment as in [the verse] (Bereishis 15:16), “For the punishment (@hh<HEB>עון@it<ENG>) sin of the Emorites will not be complete [until then].” And the term punishment generally includes any punishment that is either corporal or monetary. And @hh<HEB>ולכל חטאת@it<ENG> that is written in the verse, means sacrifices [sin-offerings]. And the reason Rashi does not explain this [that @hh<HEB>חטאת@it<ENG> means sacrifices] is because it is included in “monetary” [as sacrifices cost money], but the verse wants to specify them [sacrifices] in detail. @d1Penalized by his testimony.@bo Because a witness does not rise up [directly] to punish, but [rather rises up] against the person who deserves to be punished. It is through his testimony that the person who deserves punishment is punished. @d1However, he may rise up to require him to take an oath.@bo Rashi is answering the following question: The verse should have written “one witness may not arise, etc.” without specifying [for what], and that would imply for both corporal and monetary punishment! He answers that if Scripture had written without specifying, it would imply that it also includes an oath. Therefore it says he may not rise up “about any sin or for any transgression,” but he may rise up to require him to take an oath. @d1But they cannot write their testimony in a letter, etc.@bo You might ask: Why Rashi does not explain this above (17:6) at the verse, “By the speech of two witnesses or three witnesses”? The answer is that above it says “by the speech” because of the flow of the verse [idiom]. But here it is problematical why does the verse say “by the word” twice? Why is it not written, “By the word of two or three, etc.”? Perforce it is to expound -“but they cannot write their testimony in a letter, etc.” @d1Nor may a translator stand between the witnesses and the justices.@bo For example, if the judges do not understand the witnesses’ language. Because “by the word of two witnesses” means by word of two people giving testimony in @ITbeis din,@it [and] that the @ITbeis din@it accepts the testimony [directly] from their mouths. @p1[16]@p2<TIE>As the witness was dissociated from the entire testimony, etc.@bo This is not the case where two [sets of] witnesses merely contradict each other, because each agrees that the other was present at the incident, except that one says that the incident was like this and the other says it was like that. Regarding conspiring witnesses however, the witness is disassociated from his entire testimony, because these witnesses say, “You were with us and you were not present at that incident.” @p1[17]@p2<TIE>Our passage refers to the witnesses, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Do two people become involved in a court dispute but three people not become involved in a court dispute? Furthermore, the verse should have said, “And those who are involved in the dispute shall stand,” because women too can be litigants! Therefore the verse must be talking about witnesses. @d1This refers to the litigants.@bo And it is as if it said, “The two men and those who are involved in the dispute shall stand.” @p1[18]@p2<TIE>@d1This is directed at those asserting that the witnesses were conspirators, etc.@bo Rashi is explaining that this investigation is not directed at the first witnesses but at those who come to assert that they [the first witnesses] were conspirators. [Thus:] “When the judges shall investigate” the [second] witnesses who are asserting that [the first witnesses] were conspirators, “and behold,” it is found that the first “witness testified falsely, etc. You are to do to [each of] them as he conspired to do to his brother.” But if the first witnesses are found to be liars during the actual investigation they are not condemned as conspirators; rather, their testimony is disqualified. The reason Rashi explains our verse out of order [in some Rashi texts] is because he wants to bring further proof that “the judges shall investigate, etc.” refers to those [second witnesses] asserting that the [first] witnesses were conspirators. Because “wherever ‘witness’ is mentioned, Scripture refers to two.” If so, perforce “the judges shall investigate” refers to those [second witnesses] who are asserting that the [first] witnesses were conspirators, since the [first witnesses] can only be condemned as conspirators if both of them are condemned. But if only one of the [first] witnesses was asserted as a conspirator, they would not be condemned as conspirators. However, if “the judges shall investigate” is referring to finding contradictions between the two [first] witnesses, why do I need two of them [to be disqualified in this way]? Even if only one of them contradicted his fellow during the investigations or the interrogations, their [entire] testimony would be disqualified, as the Tur writes in Laws of Testimony (Choshen Mishpat 30).<QC>
Wherever “witness” is mentioned, Scripture refers to two.@bo Even though Rashi already explained this above (v. 15), he repeats it here so that one should not err and say that [even] if [only] one of them was found to be a conspirator he is killed, as Yehudah ben Tabai initially thought when he killed a conspiring witness (Makkos 5b). Therefore Rashi repeats it here, “Wherever etc,” so, that people cannot be condemned as conspiring witnesses until both of them are found to be conspirators. @p1[19]@p2<TIE>From here it is derived that if the execution was carried out, the witnesses are not executed.@bo Because the executed person must have been liable for the death penalty for some other reason, and that is why he was executed. Otherwise, how could the Holy One Blessed Is He allow this perversion of a person being executed by @ITbeis din@it for no reason? Why did Hashem not cause those who disqualified the conspirators to come before he was executed? Therefore he must have been liable for the death penalty by @ITbeis din@it for some other reason, and therefore it so happened that he was killed because those who disqualified the conspirators arrived. Therefore [the conspirators] are not executed. There are other reasons as well. See the commentators. @d1Except where the punishment for conspiracy may be fulfilled, etc.@bo But where they are coming to kill only her, for example if she committed murder or desecrated Shabbos, they are executed by the same method she would have been executed. @p1[20]@p2<TIE>From here we derive that there must be a proclamation, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Why the verse here differs and writes “the remainder,” and does not write “and all of Israel” as it does in @ITparshas@it Re’ey (above 13:12) regarding an inciter? He explains that this is because there must be a proclamation by the court, “So and so were executed, etc.” But people who are disqualified to give testimony such as robbers, thieves, usurers and other people who are disqualified from giving testimony that are listed in the Mishnah, are disqualified from giving testimony [this warning is not necessary]. Therefore Scripture does not write “all of Israel” because someone who is disqualified from giving testimony has no need to fearful [since he is disqualified in any case]. Therefore Scripture writes “the remainder, etc.,” i.e., the remainder who are qualified to give testimony. This also answers why Rashi does not explain here “that we wait with him until the festival” as [he writes] at the beginning of the @ITparsha@it (above 17:13). @p1[21]@p2<TIE>Monetary payment. Similarly, “tooth for tooth.”@bo The explanation is as it says in Perek Hachovel (Bava Kama 84a): Indeed, it writes, “You are to do to [each of] them as he conspired.” And if you suggest “hand for hand” is to be understood literally, then for what reason do I need “hand for hand”? And Rashi explains that if someone testified that so and so cut off the hand of so and so, he pays money, a commodity that is given from hand to hand. Because if the verse is to be understood literally, it already is written, “You are to do to [each of] them as he conspired.” @p1[1]@p2<TIE>Scripture positioned going to war, .<TIE>.<TIE>. to teach, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Scripture should have juxtapositioned over here the judiciary laws of @ITparshas@it Ki Seitzei (below 21:22), “If a man is guilty of a capital offense, etc.,” and the other capital offenses mentioned there. He answers, “To teach, etc.” @d1Another interpretation. To teach that if you judge righteously, etc.@bo According to the first interpretation you might ask that “eye for eye” mentioned here is referring to money and not the lacking of a body part. Therefore Rashi explains, “Another interpretation, etc.” And according to the other interpretation on its own you might ask that it should have juxtapositioned this to the beginning of the @ITparsha@it where it is written (above 16:18), “And they shall judge the people righteous justice, etc.” @d1Consider them enemies.@bo Otherwise, why does Scripture write “against your enemy”? Obviously, if they go out to war they are not going out against friends! @d1Do not pity them, etc.@bo One may ask: This is already explicitly written below (v. 13) “And you shall smite all its males by the sword”! Furthermore, why is it written afterwards (v. 14) “However, the women and the children, etc.” yet here Scripture implies that they should not pity them at all! The answer is: Below Scripture is dealing with a war that does not involve direct combat, rather [it is dealing] with the conquest of a city. The proof is that it is written [there] (v. 13) “Adonoy, your God, will deliver @ITit@it into your hand, and therefore it written “However, the women and the children etc.” But here we are dealing with a war that involves direct combat, so you are not to pity them at all. @d1It says, “When Pharaoh’s horse approached.”@bo Why does Rashi not cite the verse (Shmos 14:23) “@hh<HEB>כל סוס פרעה@it<ENG> (lit. every horse of Pharaoh’s)” which precedes it? The answer is that he does not cite this previous verse because it is written,@hh<HEB>כל סוס@it<ENG> , “@ITevery@it horse,” and @hh<HEB>כל@it<ENG> comes to cite something additional, so that it is as if it had written “each and every horse of Pharaoh.” Therefore he cites the verse “when Pharaoh’s horse approached” which cannot be explained in this manner. It seems to me that this [verse cited by Rashi] is a textual error; Sifrei cites the verse (ibid. 15:1), @hh<HEB>סוס ורוכבו רמה בים"@it<ENG>  (horse and its rider He threw into the sea).” (Nachalas Yaakov) @d1In your eyes they are numerous, etc.@bo Rashi is answering [the question]: It is written “horse and chariot” which implies that in the eyes of the Holy One Blessed Is He they are all like one horse, yet afterwards Scripture writes “@hh<HEB>עם רב@it<ENG> (people more numerous than you)”! And he answers, “In your eyes, etc.” @p1[2]@p2<TIE>Near your departure, etc.@bo Rashi is answering [the question]: Scripture should have written, “And as you go out to battle”! Therefore he explains, “Near, etc.” You might ask, how does Rashi know it means near the border? Perhaps it means actually drawing near to the battle? The answer is since it is written in the next verse, “Hear, Yisroel, [you are setting out today to battle], etc.,” this indicates that [the Torah] already mentions it [drawing near to battle]. [If so], why does the verse say “as you near etc”? This must mean that when they are near the border the kohein makes these conditions. See Sotah (42a). @d1He was entitled “The one annointed for warfare.”@bo Because it is written afterwards, “@hh<HEB>ודברו השוטרים@it<ENG> (the officers will address, etc.)” @hh<HEB>כהן@it<ENG> is juxtaposed to @hh<HEB>שוטרים@it<ENG>, to teach that just as the officers have someone appointed over them, namely judges, so too, the @ITkohein@it has someone appointed over him, namely the high priest, because the high priest is more important than him. @d1In the sacred Hebrew tongue.@bo Because it is written here, “And @ITspeak@it to the people,” and elsewhere in @ITparshas Vayishma Yisro@it (Shmos 19:19) it is written, “Moshe @ITspoke@it and Hashem responded with [His] voice.” Just as there it was in the sacred Hebrew tongue, i.e., the Ten Commandments, so too, “and speak to the people” is in the sacred Hebrew tongue (Sotah ibid). Alternatively, it is written regarding Yosef (Bereishis 45:12), “That I @ITspeak@it to you with my own mouth.” Just as there it was in the sacred Hebrew tongue, so here too it is in the sacred Hebrew tongue. @p1[3]@p2<TIE>Other than the reading of the Shema, etc.@bo Otherwise, why do I need [the verse to say] “Hear Yisroel etc”? Scripture [already] writes, “The @ITkohein@it shall approach and speak to the people, etc.” @d1They will be merciless towards you, etc.@bo Otherwise, it is already written “When you go to war against your @ITenemy@it.” @d1The Gentile monarchs do. They fasten their armor plates, etc.@bo Meaning, they attach their [armor] plates one to another so as the plates strike against each other they emit a clamor. @d1From the horses’ neighing (@HB<HEB>צהלת@BO<ENG>).@bo @itMeaning, the neighing of the horses is called @hh<HEB>צהלת@it<ENG>. @p1[4]@p2<TIE>This refers to the camp of the sacred ark.@bo Because it is impossible to say that it refers to the Holy One Blessed Is He that He marches @ITwith you@it, since the whole world is full of His glory. Therefore he explains, “This refers to the camp, etc.”<QC>
@p1[5]@p2<TIE>This is a matter of great anguish.@bo Otherwise, what difference does it make if he inaugurates it or if someone else does? @p1[7]@p2<TIE>For if he does not follow the instructions of the @BIkohein@BO etc.@bo I.e., he certainly returns in order to protect those [who return because of their transgressions], etc. [Therefore] if the @ITkohein@it told him to return and he does not return, he transgresses the words of the @ITkohein@it and deserves to die in battle because of this sin, and this goes according to the opinion [of R’ Yosi Hagalili] that there is no death without sin. This answers why [in some texts] Rashi explains “lest he die in battle” at the end and not according to the order of the text that is written in the verses, because he is explaining according to [the view of] R’ Yosi Hagalili. (In the name of the Maharitz, and this is similar to @ITRe”m@it’s explanation). @p1[8]@p2<TIE>R’ Yosi Hagalili said, one who is afraid because of his transgressions, etc.@bo Rashi means to say, R’ Yosi Hagalili is of the opinion that there cannot be death without transgression, and thus, if he is without transgression, why should he be afraid of battle? So most certainly he is afraid of his transgressions. But now Rashi questions: If there is no death without transgression, why then does the Torah decree to return [from going to battle] because of one’s house, or vineyard or wife [to protect those who return because of their transgressions]? If they [the latter] are without transgressions, they do not return even because of a house, or vineyard or wife according to R’ Yosi Hagalili! Rashi answers that they certainly do not have transgressions. But the Torah decrees that they return in order “to protect those who return because of their transgressions, etc.” Rashi then questions that according to R’ Yosi Hagalili who says that the reason that they return because of a house, vineyard or wife is in order to protect those who return because of their transgressions, why does Scripture write regarding each one of these “lest he die in battle,” which implies that he returns because of [fear of] death? This indicates that there is death without transgression! Rashi answers: [This is what Scripture is saying:] “Lest he die in battle, etc.” [He should return lest he die, for if he transgresses the words of the @ITkohein,@it he deserves to die.]” @p1[9]@p2<TIE>Do not run away, for running away is the beginning of downfall.@bo Rashi is of the opinion that whoever flees ends up having a downfall because it says (Shmuel I 31:1), “And the men of Israel fled from before the Plishtim and they fell corpses in Mount Gilboa.” And so it says in Sotah (44b).<QC>
@p1[11]@p2<TIE>Even if you should find in it members of the seven nations, etc.@bo You might ask, why do we need a verse [to teach us this]? We can derive this from the inclusionary term, “And you capture prisoners @ITfrom them@it,” which teaches us to include the Canaanites among them, as Rashi explains later (21:10)! The answer is that if [we learnt this] from there, one might have thought that only if they were found in a town that did not make peace [with you] where one is obligated to kill all the males inside, is the Torah lenient regarding the [female and minor] Canaanites inside, allowing them to be saved with the town’s women and minors, since the men, who are the principle idolaters, are killed. But if they are found in a town that made peace where everyone is saved [including] the men, women and children, one might say that the Canaanites inside are to be treated as if they were in their own town. So [the extra verse] tells us [that this is not so, and the Canaanites are saved even in the latter case]. And if [we learnt] from here, one may have though that this applies only when they were found in a town of other nations that had made peace, because since they submitted to us, the Torah is lenient regarding the Canaanites inside. But if they were found in a town of other nations that did not make peace, whose men are killed, one might have thought that the [female and minor] Canaanites inside are also killed as if they were in their own town. So Scripture tells us [that this is not so and the Canaanites are saved even in this case]. These are [the words of] @ITRe”m@it. (See what I write later regarding this).<QC>
@p1[12]@p2<TIE>It will ultimately engage in war against you, etc.@bo And this is what the verse is saying: If it does not settle for peace with you, in the end it will engage in war against you. Therefore you should lay siege to it.<QC>
@p1[17]@p2<TIE>This adds the Girgashites.@bo Rashi means to say that [only] six nations are mentioned in the verse but the Girgashites are not mentioned. And “as [Hashem] commanded you” includes the Girgashites. The reason the verse does not mention [them] explicitly is because [the command], “Annihilate are you to annihilate them, etc.,” was not fulfilled regarding them, for the Girgashites rose up and fled [before Israel’s conquest] as Rashi explains in @ITparshas@it Ki Sisa (Shmos 33:2). (Maharan). Nevertheless, the verse [here] still needed to include them because they are included in [the command here], “You are not to leave any person alive.” And if members of them are found among the six [remaining] nations, [you should know] that they too are like them. @p1[18]@p2<TIE>This infers that if they repent, etc.@bo You might ask: If they repent and convert it is obvious that one may be received, so what is the verse teaching us? One answer is that it is teaching us that one is permitted to receive them even if they only accepted upon themselves the seven Noachide mitzvos. (@ITRe”m@it). Another answer is that one may have thought that they may not be received even if they repented and converted, for perhaps they converted only out of fear but they did not fully repent. So it teaches us [otherwise].<QC>
@p1[19]@p2<TIE>Fewer than three days before Shabbos, etc.@bo You might ask: Shabbos is not even mentioned in the verse, and that is what @ITRe”m@it [also] questions! The answer is that we learn from this verse that one has to tender a peace overture for at least three days. But if they besiege a town of idolaters less than three days before Shabbos they would have to tender peace overtures even on Shabbos, but the verse writes (Yeshayah 58:13), “From doing @ITyour@it matters,” heavenly matters are permitted [to be addressed but] your personal [business] matters are forbidden [to be addressed] on Shabbos; and the tendering of peace overtures is considered personal [business]. Therefore we do not besiege [a town a town of idolaters] less than three days before Shabbos. It may be that @ITRe”m@it meant this when he wrote, “And perhaps the answer is that one has to tender them a peace overture and it requires three days for the idolaters to take counsel among themselves in order to give a reply.” @d1Scripture refers to discretionary warfare.@bo Because it is written “to capture it,” which implies that they are only coming to capture [the town]. We thus see that it refers to discretionary warfare [outside the Land of Israel], because if it is speaking of the war to conquer the Land of Israel, the verse has already written (v. 16), “You are not to leave any person alive.” @d1Perhaps the tree in the field is a man, to be included, etc.@bo I.e., is the tree in the field perhaps like a man? Because it is the custom of people besieging a town that when they capture one of its inhabitants they torture him with hunger and thirst so that those in the town should fear them [and that would dissuade them] from being involved in the siege and [they too] suffer the pain of hunger and thirst. And perhaps you think that the tree in the field is the same, that if you cut it down, the other trees will fear them [and dissuade them] from being involved in the siege, just as [it works for] the town’s inhabitants. But this is not so, why destroy it?!<QC>
@p1[20]@p2<TIE>The meaning is “conquest.” Until it is subjugated to you.@bo [An expression] similar to “conquer (@hh<HEB>רדה@it<ENG>) in the midst of your enemies” (Tehillim 110:2), because the term @hh<HEB>ירידה@it<ENG> (falling) does not refer to the town, meaning its people, but to its walls. @p1[2]@p2<TIE>The most distinguished of your elders, etc.@bo Because it should have said “the elders of the city” similar to “the elders of that city are to take.” Yet it is written “your @ITelders@it,” implying “the most distinguished of your elders,” i.e. the Sanhedrin; see there in Maseches Sanhedrin (14b). @d1From the spot where the corpse is lying.@bo Even though the verse tells us only the end of the measurement and not the beginning, it is logical that the measurement begins with the corpse. @d1In every direction, in order to determine which is closest.@bo Not that there is an obligation to measure from the corpse to every city; rather, the measurement is to determine which city is nearest the corpse. Therefore if the corpse was near a city and it is certain that there is no other city closer, there is no need for measuring.<QC>
@p1[4]@p2<TIE>Hard, which cannot be cultivated.@bo I.e. @hh<HEB>איתן@it<ENG> is an expression of toughness and hardness. @d1By severing the nape with an axe, etc.@bo We derive this by [comparing]@hh<HEB>עריפה@it<ENG>  [that is written here to] @hh<HEB>עריפה@it<ENG> [of] the bird sin-offering. Just as there it is at the nape, so too here. The meaning of @hh<HEB>וערפו@it<ENG> is to remove its nape, just as the word @hh<HEB>תזמור@it<ENG>, “you shall [not] prune” (Vayikra 25:3), means to remove a twig (@hh<HEB>זמורה@it<ENG>). @d1Who was not permitted to bear fruit.@bo You might ask: This implies that if the murdered victim was an old person or a eunuch who does not bear fruit, a decapitated calf would not be brought; but this is not so, because the verse does not differentiate! The answer is that “fruit” [here] means @ITmitzvos@it [and the verse means]@IT@it that he was not permitted to fulfill @ITmitzvos@it, for they too are called “fruit.” @p1[7]@p2<TIE>The @BIkohanim@BO then say, “Forgive your people Yisroel.”@bo Otherwise, for what purpose are the @ITkohanim@it [coming] here? [The presence of elders] is understandable for it is written, “And all the elders of that town [those near the corpse, etc. will wash their hands.”] But why are the @ITkohanim @itneeded? They [are the ones who] recite, “Forgive your people Yisroel.”<QC>
@p1[10]@p2<TIE>For with regard to the war for Eretz Yisroel it would be inappropriate to say “and you capture prisoners from them,” etc.@bo You might ask: Perhaps Scripture’s subject is the warfare of Eretz Yisroel, and when it writes, “And you capture prisoners from them,” it refers to a case where there were [people] from nations other than the seven nations inside [the town]. The answer is that Rashi himself answers this question when he explains afterwards: “And you capture prisoners from them,” this includes the Canaanites among them, although they are members of the seven nations. This implies that we always go according to the people of the town. For here if the people of the town are from other nations, one is also permitted to keep alive the Canaanites inside it. And the same applies if the citizens of the town are of the seven nations, one is not permitted to keep alive [people from] other nations inside it. Therefore if the verse is speaking of warfare of Eretz Yisroel, Scripture would not write “and you capture prisoners from them,” because you would not be able to say that it refers to [people from] other nations inside it, since it is forbidden to keep alive even [people from] other nations that are inside it as we explained. (I found this in the name of Maharitz). @ITRe”m@it answers that since the main point of the @ITparsha@it is to permit the “beautifully formed woman,” it would only permit her in optional warfare where all women are permitted [to be kept alive], and not in obligatory warfare where the prohibition of “You are not to leave any person alive (above 20:16)” applies to every woman except the one that he captured [who] is of other nations. And perhaps he will not capture her, and even if he does capture her it would be a very rare possibility. @d1This includes the Canaanites among them, etc.@bo And their wives and children are saved like them. Otherwise, why is [the apparently superfluous word] @hh<HEB>שביו@it<ENG> necessary. See the verse above in @ITparshas @itShoftim (20:11), “All the people found in it.” @p1[11]@p2<TIE>Only in deference to the wicked inclination, etc.@bo Rashi is answering [the following]: The expression, @hh<HEB>ולקחת לך לאשה@it<ENG>, seems to imply that it is a positive mitzvah to take [this] non-Jewess for a wife, but this is not so, for it is better to marry a Jewess! @d1Even someone’s wife.@bo The reason Rashi explains [“a wife”] out of order [that it appears] in the verse is because he does not wish to explain the verse, but he is referring to what he explained above, “for if the Holy One, Blessed Is He, would not permit her, he would live with her illicitly.” And [thus we can infer that] if the Torah has to permit “the beautifully formed woman,” this indicates that without [the verse permitting] “the beautifully formed woman,” she would be forbidden [to him] by Torah command. But this is not so, because a non-Jewess is forbidden only by Rabbinic decree! As [the Gemora] says that the sages decreed that one who has relations with a non-Jewess is liable because of @ITnashgaz@it (as if she was a @ITnidah, shifcha@it [maidservant], @ITgoyah@it [non-Jewess] and @ITzonah@it [harlot]). [To answer this question], Rashi explains that although an unmarried non-Jewess is certainly forbidden only by Rabbinic decree, the verse here writes @hh<HEB>אשת@it<ENG>, which implies [even if she is] someone’s wife. You might ask: What difference does it make if she is someone’s wife? Non-Jews cannot contract a marriage because it is written (Vayikra 20:10). “A man who commits adultery with the wife of his @ITfellow@it (@hh<HEB>רעהו@it<ENG>),” and we say (Sanhedrin 52b), “the wife of his @ITfellow@it” [comes] to exclude the wife of a non-Jew,” for a non-Jew cannot contract a marriage! [The answer is that] a [non-Jewess] who is the wife of [a non-Jew] is nevertheless forbidden [and the above verse only excludes a non-Jew marrying a Jewess]. The sons of Noach are also commanded regarding married women as it is written (Bereishis 2:24), “Therefore, a man shall leave his father and his mother, and cleave to @IThis@it wife,” and [the sages] say (Sanhedrin 58a): “To @IThis@it wife,” and not to the wife of his fellow. And similarly regarding Avimelech it is written (Bereishis 20:3), “For she is a married woman.” This indicates that a married woman is forbidden even to sons of Noach and how much more so she is forbidden to a Jew. But in the case of “the beautifully formed woman,” the Holy One Blessed Is He permitted her. @p1[12]@p2<TIE>She must allow them to grow so that she becomes ugly.@bo See [Rashi on] @ITparshas@it Bereishis (1:7) on the verse, “Elohim made the canopy.” @p1[13]@p2<TIE>As they are attractive, etc.@bo Rashi is answering [the question]: It is not the way of the world for people to wear unappealing clothing on the road so that [their] attractive clothing does not become dirty? If so, she should not remove these clothes so that she becomes repulsive to him! He explains that the way of the Israelite nation is certainly so, that they wear unappealing clothing when they go out on the road, but “the young gentile women, etc.” @d1In the home he makes use of, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: The verse should only have said “and she should sit and weep for her father and her mother,” since obviously she is in your house, for above it is written, “You will bring her into your house”! He answers that you might have thought that if he had two or three houses and lived in only one of them, she may sit in the one that he does not live. Therefore it says, “She will remain in @ITyour@it home,” [i.e.,] “in the home he makes use of,” meaning in the place that is his primary residence. @d1Why to such an extent? So that the Israelite daughter, etc.@bo I.e., why does the Torah say that she should mourn over her idolatrous father and weep? She is [now] a convert! Rashi answers that this crying is not on account of her father’s honor, but “so that, etc.” @p1[14]@p2<TIE>Scripture informs you that you will ultimately hate her.@bo @ITRe”m@it writes: I do not know from where they expound this, etc. It seems [to me] that they expound this because it is written, @hh<HEB>והיה אם וגו'@it<ENG>, (But it shall come to pass, etc.)” and the word@hh<HEB>והיה @it<ENG> is an expression of certainty [that he will hate her], and therefore they expound what they expound. You cannot say that (@hh<HEB>והיה@it<ENG>) refers to the end of the verse [and it means that he must certainly send her away], because [if so], it should have said “@hh<HEB>אם לא תחפוץ@it<ENG> (If you will not desire her),” in the future tense, and not “@hh<HEB>חפצת@it<ENG> (lit. you did not want)” in the past tense. Therefore [it means] “Scripture informs you, etc.” You might ask that Rashi [already] explained above (v. 11), “However, if he does marry her, he will ultimately hate her, etc.” If so, why do we need [this verse] “but it shall come to pass, etc.” to inform of this; it is [already learnt] from the juxtaposition of these sections as Rashi explained above? The answer is in accordance to Tosefos’ explanation of Rashi, and @ITRe”m@it cites this in his book and discusses it there at length, that Rashi explains in the first chapter of Kiddushin (22a): The Torah does not permit him [to have] even the first intimate relations [with her] except after doing all these actions [including marrying her]. It seems that the verse too supports him because it is written, “And afterwards you may come to her and consummate with her,” and it says afterwards, “And she will become your wife,” [implying that with this first consummation she becomes his wife]. If so, we can say that the verse, “But it shall come to pass, that if you do not desire her,” is saying that he should not even have this first marital relations with her. And from the juxtaposition of these sections we learn that beginning with the second [instance of] intimate relations and onward, that if he takes her, and forcibly converts her and takes her as a wife [for the long term], “he will ultimately hate her, etc.”<QC>
@p1[17]@p2<TIE>Equivalent to two brothers.@bo Rashi is answering the question: “Doublefold of all that he possesses” implies doublefold of everything he possesses, i.e. that he should have two portions. [For example,] if he left three @ITmanah@it and there were five brothers, the firstborn should take two @ITmanah@it and the four [remaining] brothers should take one [@ITmanah@it]! Rashi answers that “of all he possesses” does not refer to “doublefold” but means as follows: “Doublefold [of one brother’s share],’ i.e., the equivalent of what two brothers [take].” And [the term] “of all that he possesses” is a separate phrase. @d1Does not inherit doublefold of receivables due, etc.@bo Rashi means that he inherits doublefold only from “all that he possesses”, i.e. what the father has now and [actually] possesses, but regarding receivables, such as when a legator of his father died after the father died, even though the father receives ownership of the [the legator’s] money in the grave, the firstborn does not take doublefold of those funds, but [takes only a single portion] like a regular brother. The same applies if the father had a loan [that was owed to him] without a pledge. This too is “a receivable” and the firstborn does not receive doublefold of it. @p1[18]@p2<TIE>They warn him before three [magistrates] and have him flogged, etc.@bo Rashi is citing the words of the Mishnah (Sanhedrin 71a) that says, “They warn him before three and have him flogged.” The Gemora explains that the Mishnah is speaking of two separate cases, that they warn him before two [witnesses] and he is flogged before three [magistrates]. You might ask, from where does Rashi derive that they have him flogged [and not some other form of chastening]? The answer is that it is written here “@hh<HEB>בן סורר@it<ENG> (a wayward son),” and later (25:2) it is written, “@hh<HEB>והיה אם בן הכות הרשע@it<ENG> (should the wicked one deserve flogging).” And we derive a law by comparing [the section here that says] @hh<HEB>בן@it<ENG> to [the section there where it says] @hh<HEB>בן@it<ENG>. Just as over there, there is flogging, so here too there is flogging. @d1And consumes a @BItartamor@BO of meat, etc.@bo Because you might ask: What do the witnesses warn him about? [Therefore] Rashi explains, “The wayward, rebellious son is not liable, etc.” Therefore they warn him to not steal and to not eat a @ITtartamor@it of meat. @d1Do not be among the wine guzzlers, among those who gluttonously consume meat [for themselves], etc.@bo This indicates that the terms @hh<HEB>זולל וסובא@it<ENG> applies to meat and wine. Rashi then asks: Why should he be killed for stealing and eating a @ITtartamor@it of meat and drinking a half @ITlog@it of wine? He explains, “The wayward, rebellious son is executed in consideration of his [ignoble] end, etc.” You might ask: Why is the wayward and rebellious son singled out that “the the Torah penetrates to the logical conclusion of his thought” and is executed in consideration of his ignoble end? But regarding Yishmael it is written (Bereishis 21:17), “in the place where he is,” and Rashi explains, “He is judged according to his @ITpresent@it deeds and not according to what he will do in the future, etc.” See Rashi there in @ITparshas@it Vayera. The answer is that there regarding Yishmael who was still a child, so he had not started doing anything connected to that [future] sin of killing Israel by thirst. But the wayward and rebellious son began [doing things that will ultimately lead] to that sin [of robbery], because he ate a @ITtartamor@it of meat. Another answer is that the Heavenly court does not judge [a person] in consideration of his end, but it is a mitzvah for the Beis Din below [i.e., our court system] to judge a person in consideration of his end. @d1Station himself near an intersection and plunder, etc.@bo I.e., and he will kill them. You might ask: Why is he punished with stoning, which is a more severe form of death? But the [death of] a murderer is [execution] by the sword! The answer is that he sometimes robs and kills on Shabbos. Thus he desecrates Shabbos and is therefore liable to be executed by stoning because of taking a life [and he is punished with stoning for desecrating Shabbos]. @p1[21]@p2<TIE>From here [we derive] that there must be a proclamation, etc.@bo You might ask: How does Rashi know that all that is required is a proclamation? But the verse writes here, “Let all Yisroel hear,” why does Rashi not write “that we wait with him until the festival” as he explains in @ITparshas @itShoftim (above 17:13) [the verse] “Let all the people hear and fear” [in the section] dealing with @hh<HEB>זקן ממרא@it<ENG> (the rebellious elder)! The answer is that there (17:7) it is written, “Let the hand of the witnesses be against him first to execute him, and the hand of the entire people afterward,” whereas here it implies that the people of his town begin first to stone him as it is written, “And all the men of his city will stone him.” Therefore one must explain [here that the verse means] in the presence of all the people of his city, as Rashi explains below (22:21) regarding, “the people of her city will stone her” written in [the @ITparsha@it of] the defamer, “in the presence of all the people of her city.” But if you say that here [too] we wait with him until the festival, why does it say [to stone him] in the presence of all the people of the city? It would take place in the presence of all Israel since all Israel would be there! Therefore, [this proves that] we certainly do not wait with him until the festival and when Scripture writes “Let all Israel hear,” it means that “there must be a proclamation at the courthouse.” Another answer is: One might ask why it is written [here], “All the men of his city will stone him etc.” when it is written [earlier] (17:7), “Let the hand of the witnesses be against him first etc”? You cannot answer that when it is written “all the men of his city” it means “in the presence of all the men of his city,” because Scripture writes “and let all Israel hear,” which implies that this takes place in the presence of all Israel. So the verse should have said, “All Israel will stone him.” If so, our [original] question returns, that it is written, “Let the hands of the witnesses, etc.” Rashi answers that “all Israel” comes [to teach] that there is a proclamation and [therefore we can answer] as we said originally, “All the men of his city will stone him” [means] “in the presence of all the people of his city.” See more about this subject in @ITparshas@it Shoftim. @p1[22]@p2<TIE>The Rabbis remark that all those who are stoned are also hung, etc.@bo Because it is written, “[If a man is guilty of a capital offense] and is executed; you shall hang [him from a tree].” This is a general rule (@hh<HEB>כלל@it<ENG>) that implies that all those who are executed are hung. Afterwards it is written, “For a hanging corpse is an affront to Hashem.” This is a specific statement (@hh<HEB>פרט@it<ENG>) that implies that only someone who blesses [i.e. curses] the Name, is hung [because when people see him they are reminded of his sin that was an affront to Hashem], but not others who are executed, even those executed by stoning. When they (i.e., a @hh<HEB>כלל@it<ENG> and a @hh<HEB>פרט@it<ENG>) are juxtaposed, it is considered [a case of] @hh<HEB>כלל ופרט@it<ENG> where [the rule is] the general rule only includes what is in the specific case; [implying] someone who blesses the Name, yes [i.e., he is hung, but] any other case, no [i.e., he is not hung]. But now [in our verses] they [the @hh<HEB>כלל@it<ENG> and the @hh<HEB>פרט@it<ENG>] are distant from each other, the general rule comes [and teaches] to include all who are executed. And the particular case comes and limits the general rule [and teaches] that only those who are stoned are hung, since they are partially similar to the particular case, for they are stoned just as the one who blessed the Name [is stoned]. @p1[23]@p2<TIE>It is an affront to the king, etc.@bo Rashi’s intends to explain the word @hh<HEB>כי@it<ENG>, “for.” What reason is this for what is [said] above? He explains, “It is an affront, etc.” This [answer] is according to what our Rabbis (i.e. R. Eliezer, Sanhedrin ibid.) expound, “All those who are stoned are also hung.” However, according to the sages who say that the ones who are stoned are not hung except for the blasphemer and the idolater, who is also similar to the blasphemer, you have to say that when it is written @hh<HEB>כי קללת אלהים@it<ENG>, it means “(For) the one who curses Hashem (is hung),” and @hh<HEB>קללת@it<ENG> is an expression of cursing. [If so, why does Rashi not explain the verse according to the sages whose opinion is accepted as halacha?] The reason is that] by explaining the verse according to the Midrash [that says that each @ITparsha@it is connected to the one adjacent to it] brings it closer to the plain meaning [of the verses], and the juxtaposition of the sections indicates that all those who are stoned are also hung, Rashi therefore explains [like R. Eliezer] that @hh<HEB>קללת@it<ENG> is an expression of “affront.” (See @ITRe”m@it who discusses this at length). Another answer [that the word @hh<HEB>קללת@it<ENG> means both “affront” and also “curse,”] is that otherwise you might ask, from where does Rashi know that all those who are stoned are also hung if he [later] explains that @hh<HEB>קללת@it<ENG> is an expression of an affront [and not an expression of “curse.” How then does he know that the verse is talking about someone who incurred stoning for cursing?]. [The answer is] that one must to say that [@hh<HEB>קללת@it<ENG>] implies both [curse and an affront], because if it means only to “bless” the Name, it should have said, “(For he who) blesses Hashem,” [which is] a “clean” expression. Therefore [this indicates that] @hh<HEB>קללת@it<ENG> is an expression denoting an affront. And, if it was an expression denoting only an affront, it should have said explicitly an expression denoting an affront. Therefore [we must say that] it is also coming [to be understood] as blessing Hashem. (I found [this interpretation]) @d1And the Israelites are His children.@bo Rashi means, and especially Israel who are also His children, therefore, “Do not leave his corpse overnight on the tree.” Because “This is compared to two brothers, etc.” @p1[1]@p2<TIE>Avert your eyes as if you do not notice it.@bo Because you cannot say [it means] that the person conceals from telling that he found them, because if so, if should have said “and conceal @ITthem@it,” which would imply that he is concealing [the fact] that he has them. But because it is written “and conceal yourself from them,” it implies that he conceals his eye from seeing it. @d1You may not observe it, etc.@bo Rashi is answering [a difficulty]: The verse seems to be saying, “Do not see, rather conceal, etc.,” which implies that one is permitted to conceal himself [and this is not so]. @d1The Rabbis, however, comment: At times, you may conceal yourself, etc.@bo In which case? If he is a @ITkohein@it and there is a [lost] ox in a cemetery; or if he is an elder and it is not fitting for his honor. @p1[2]@p2<TIE>Would it seem reasonable etc. But, rather, ask him [about it].@bo And the word @hh<HEB>אותו@it<ENG> refers back to “your brother,” meaning that you should inquire of your brother who is the owner of the lost item [by asking] for signs that the lost item had. @d1Provided there is a return, etc.@bo Rashi is answering [the difficulty] that the verse should not have said “and you shall return it to him” [because that is obvious], but [only] “until your brother seeks it,” and if it is known to him that you have it, you are certainly obligated to return it to him. @d1Which does not produce and eat, shall be sold.@bo So that one can fulfill, “And you shall return it to him.” @p1[3]@p2<TIE>By averting your eyes, etc.@bo Rashi has to give this explanation [again] even though he had given it above (v. 1), because he [then] explained the verse again according to the teaching of the sages that “at times you may conceal yourself,” so it seems as if he is not sure of the verse’s meaning. Therefore he says here that it is impossible to explain “you may not conceal yourself” except [as meaning] that you should @ITnot@it [conceal yourself, unlike the earlier verse where it also means that you sometimes may conceal yourself, etc.] @p1[4]@p2<TIE>This refers to loading — to load the burden, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Why does Scripture change the wording? Here it is written, “You must surely @ITlift@it it up with him,” but in @ITparshas@it Mishpatim (Shmos 23:5) it writes, “You shall surely @IThelp@it [etc.]” He explains that there it is talking about unloading, to unload the burden, but the section here deals with loading. @p1[5]@p2<TIE>He may not shave the pubic hairs, etc.@bo I.e. [because] women customarily do this, meaning that he should not ornament himself with women’s adornments. You might ask: Why does Rashi give an alternative explanation [only] to the end of the verse? He should also have given an alternative interpretation to the beginning of the verse as well! For the Gemora (Nazir 59a) explains: R. Eliezer ben Yaakov says: From where [do we know that] a woman may not put on weapons and go out to war, because the verse teaches, “A man’s attire may not be on a woman.” @ITRe”m@it writes: The same applies too, that a woman may not go out with weapons to war. Another answer why [Rashi offers] the alternative explanation [is because that] answers the question: Why in the beginning of the verse is it written, “A man’s attire may not to be on a woman,” while at the end [of the verse] it writes, “nor may a man wear a woman’s garment”? It should have written, “A woman’s attire should not be on a man”! Since Scripture alters [the wording], the verse is obviously talking about another matter [i.e., shaving the pubic hairs, etc.]. But according to the alternative explanation too, one has to answer why the verse uses a term of “wearing.” It should have said, “He should not adorn with women’s adornments.” Therefore the first explanation is also needed. @d1The Torah prohibited only, etc.@bo Rashi wants to explain what he said earlier, “So that she resembles a man, in order to mingle with men,” and also afterwards, “In order to take a place among women,” so that you do not ask, how does he know to explain this way. Perhaps it is forbidden to wear [such clothes] in all circumstances because it is a Scriptural decree? He answers that [it is not a Scriptural decree] as the verse gives a reason [for it], “For the abomination of Adonoy, etc.” This indicates that “the Torah prohibited only, etc.” @p1[6]@p2<TIE>While on top of her young.@bo But if she is hovering in the air above the young, it is permitted to take her. @p1[7]@p2<TIE>If, with an easily fulfilled commandment, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: It should have said this regarding one of the other mitzvos! He answers that it is written it here because this mitzvah is more easily fulfilled than all, etc.<QC>
@p1[8]@p2<TIE>He deserves to fall.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Why does the verse say @hh<HEB>הנופל@it<ENG> [lit. the one who falls]? He explains that @hh<HEB>הנופל@it<ENG> means, “He deserves to fall.” He continues and explains that if this person deserves to fall, why does one transgress a negative command if he did not make a fence and a person fell off? He explains because even so, “let his death not come about, etc.” @d1As benefit is brought about through the meritorious, and injury through the guilty.@bo And therefore everyone will murmur that you are guilty because this person fell off your roof. @p1[9]@p2<TIE>Wheat, barley, and grapeseed.@bo Not only wheat and barley, but any two kinds of other seeds [are included]. You might ask: How does Rashi know that one needs two other kinds of seeds with the grapeseed, perhaps [only] one other kind with grapeseed is enough? The answer is that if so, the verse should have said, “Do not plant @ITin@it your vineyard mixed species,” which would then imply that planting one other kind of seed within your vineyard is considered mixed species. But since it is written, “Do not plant your vineyard mixed species,” it implies that mixed species are involved here even without any consideration of your vineyard. You might ask: Why does the Torah add this prohibition here when we see earlier in @ITparshas@it Kedoshim (Vayikra 19:19) it is written that even sewing only two seeds together is forbidden? The answer is that the earlier prohibition forbids [two] mixed seeds as it is written, “Do not sow your field with a mixture of different seeds.” [By doing this] one only transgresses one negative command. But here one transgresses two negative commands, the prohibition of mixed seeds and the prohibition of mixed seeds in a vineyard. @p1[10]@p2<TIE>This applies, as well, to any two species in the universe, etc.@bo You might ask: From where does Rashi know this? Perhaps the prohibition applies only to plowing with an ox and a donkey! The answer is that we derive this by comparing the word “ox” here to the word “ox” regarding Shabbos where it says (above 5:14), “Your ox and your donkey and all your animals.” Just as there, all animals are included, so here too, all animals are included. And because “ox and donkey” is not to be understood literally, so too, “you may not plow” is not to be understood literally, “and applies as well, to leading them together, etc.” @p1[11]@p2<TIE>The meaning is “a mixture.” The Rabbis interpret, etc.@bo This excludes felt, which is not spun and woven. Such cloth is not subject to the prohibition of a mixture of threads. See earlier in @ITparshas @itKedoshim (Vayikra 19:19).<QC>
@p1[13]@p2<TIE>He will ultimately. . .@bo Rashi is answering: Why does it say, “And he has relations with her and hates her”? It should have written, “If a man marries a woman, and berates her with calumnies etc.”! He explains, this is to teach you that because he hates her, he will ultimately berate her with etc. @p1[14]@p2<TIE>We derive from here that no statement may be made, etc.@bo Otherwise, why does the verse write “@ITthis@it”? Maharan asks: Why do we need this verse? Why not learn this law from the verse of @ITparshas@it Mishpatim (Shmos 23:1), “Do not accept a false report, etc.,” and there Rashi explains, “This is an admonition… to a judge, that he not listen [to the claims of one party until the other party arrives].” The answer is that our verse is necessary to make someone who presents his claims before the other party arrives, liable for violating one negative command and one positive command. In my humble opinion you can answer that if we only had that verse one would think that the prohibition applies only when both parties themselves are making claims. But where the woman herself is not saying anything as we see in the coming verses, one might think the husband may make his claim not in her presence. So the verse tells us that this is not so. (Kitzur Mizrachi) @p1[15]@p2<TIE>Those who nurtured the evil branch, etc.@bo Otherwise, the verse should have said, “They will take the girl and prove, etc.” Why does it say, “The girl’s father and mother”? Therefore it is to be expounded: See these [i.e., these parents] who nurtured this evil branch, etc. @p1[16]@p2<TIE>This teaches that a woman is not permitted, etc.@bo Because the woman is also standing in the court as it is written, “The girl’s father and mother will take, etc.” Yet afterwards it is written, “The girl’s @ITfather@it should assert, etc.,” and it is not written, “The girl’s mother should assert.” Therefore, “This teaches, etc.” (In the name of Maharitz). @ITRe”m@it explains that [this teaching is derived because] otherwise Scripture should have said, “The @ITgirl@it should assert to the elders, ‘Look! This man has promulgated libelous words against me, etc.,” being that she is the defendant.<QC>
@p1[17]@p2<TIE>This is figurative, etc.@bo Otherwise, what would happen if the cloth had been lost or laundered; or who knows whether it is hers or whether it is virginal blood? @p1[18]@p2<TIE>Flogging.@bo Because we learn “and chastise” from “and chastise” and “son” from “son.” It is written here “and they shall @hh<HEB>ויסרו@hh@ee<ENG> (chastise him),” and by the wayward and rebellious son it is written (above 21:18) “and they shall @hh<HEB>ויסרו@hh@ee<ENG> (chastise him).” Just as over there it means flogging, so too here it means flogging. And from where do we know [that it means flogging] over there? Because by the wayward and rebellious son it is written “@hh<HEB>בן@it<ENG> (son),” and by flogging (below 25:2) it is written, “Should the wicked one (@hh<HEB>בן@it<ENG>) deserve flogging, etc.” And we learn “son” from “son” as I explained.<QC>
@p1[20]@p2<TIE>Through witnesses, and with a pre-warning, etc.@bo Otherwise, why is she stoned? For even if it is true that she behaved promiscuously, perhaps she did so before her marriage. And even if she behaved promiscuously after her marriage, perhaps she acted without witnesses or pre-warning. Therefore Rashi explains, “Through witnesses, etc.” @p1[21]@p2<TIE>In the presence of all the people of her city.@bo It seems to me Rashi is citing a proof to his explanation that “her father’s house” actually means “@ITin@it her father’s house,” i.e., the letter @hh<HEB>ב@it<ENG> [and the word “in”] is missing. [He proves this] by explaining that “the people of her city” actually means “@ITin the presence of all@it the people of her city.” The reason he says this is because the verse states, “The people of her city will stone her with stones,” which implies that they are the ones who begin [stoning], yet this cannot be because it is written (above 17:7), “Let the hand of the witnesses be against him first, etc.” Perforce the verse really means (@hh<HEB>ב@hhאנשי עירה@it<ENG>) “@ITamong@it the people of her city,” i.e. “in the presence of all the people of her city.” This proves that it is common for a verse to omit the letter @hh<HEB>ב@it<ENG> [the word “in”]. Rashi is also answering another question: The verse implies that the reason she is liable for stoning is “because she committed a disgraceful act .<TIE>.<TIE>. [in] her father’s house.” However, according to this, why does the Torah make someone liable for stoning if he had relations with a married girl [elsewhere] in the city? She did not behave promiscuously in her father’s house! To answer this question Rashi explains: “And a man encounters her in the city,” this is why he had relations with her. The breach summons the thief.” In other words, because she acted immorally by not remaining at home as is customary for virgins, then she certainly was also promiscuous in her father’s house, and therefore she is liable for stoning. Now we can understand why Rashi explains the verses out of order. [Note: In our text, Rashi explains the verses in their correct order]. This also answers @ITRe”m@it [who asks this same] question, “I do not know a correct reason, etc.” @p1[22]@p2<TIE>This excludes lascivious activity etc.@bo I.e. if he had intercourse with the woman in a body part [of the body] other than “that place.” For the woman does not derive pleasure, only the man. [In such an instance] they are both exempt because Scripture writes “both of them” which implies that they both derived equal pleasure. Even though [in a case] where he had sodomized her, and the woman does not derive pleasure, they are both liable. That case is different because it is specially included from the words (Vayikra 18:22) “@hh<HEB>משכבי אשה@it<ENG> (lit. the @ITways@it of having intercourse with a woman).” @d1This adds those following them.@bo There are varying texts here. In some commentaries it is written, “This adds those following them (@hh<HEB>אחריהם@it<ENG>),” without a @hh<HEB>מ"ם@it<ENG> at the beginning of the word. This means that if she and he were sentenced to death, even so, if he had intercourse with another woman, or if another man had intercourse with her, the secondary individuals too, are executed and we do not say that a person sentenced to death is already considered dead so that the secondary individuals are considered as if they had intercourse with corpses. Rather, these secondary individuals are also liable to the death penalty. And in some commentaries the text reads, “This adds those committing sodomy (@hh<HEB>מאחריהם@it<ENG>, lit. from behind them),” with a @hh<HEB>מ"ם@it<ENG> at the beginning of the word. This means from behind her, i.e. sodomy. @d1Another interpretation: “Even both of them,” etc.@bo Because according to the first interpretation you might ask that it is obvious he is liable if he had sodomized her, because it is written (ibid) @hh<HEB>משכבי אשה@it<ENG>, which teaches that she has two @hh<HEB>משכבים@it<ENG> (ways to “lie” with her), a normal way and through sodomy. So why do I need the word “also”? Therefore Rashi explains, “Another interpretation, etc.” And according to the other interpretation you might ask that it should have said, “They shall both die, the man who had intercourse with the woman [and] also (@hh<HEB>גם@it<ENG>) the woman.” Therefore he gives the first interpretation. @d1Adds the fetus — if she was pregnant, etc.@bo Regarding a similar matter Rashi explains in Erchin (7a), “Because it should [only] say @hh<HEB>ומתו@it<ENG> (they shall die), and I would know that “they shall die” cannot mean less than two. (Nachalas Yaakov) @p1[26]@p2<TIE>This (the murderer) appears to teach, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: The wording of the verse implies that the murderer is teaching us something about the married girl, whereas we actually learn nothing from the murderer! [Actually] the murderer “learns” from the married girl. Just as the married girl can be saved from sin by killing the rapist as the verse indicates by saying, “there was no one to rescue her,” implying that if there was someone to rescue her, he could do so by using any means, so too in the case of the murderer, one may save the [intended] victim by killing the pursuer. @p1[1]@p2<TIE>He cannot effect marriage with her, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: It should have said “he may not expose” as it is written in the end [of the verse], “And may not expose.” He explains that @hh<HEB>קיחה@it<ENG> implies that he cannot effect marriage with her, i.e. [he cannot] marry her with money, because we derive this law by comparing the expression @hh<HEB>קיחה@it<ENG> written here to @hh<HEB>קיחה@it<ENG> written regarding the field of Efron (Kiddushin 2a) [where it denotes marrying with money]. Rashi is referring to [marrying] her after the death of his father, otherwise, we would know [that he cannot marry her] because she is a married woman. @d1His father’s prospective levirate partner, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Why does the verse needs to add, “And may not expose the edge of his father’s garment,” [which seems superfluous]? Therefore he says that it comes to include his father’s prospective levirate partner, etc. @d1Evidently, to transgress, with her, against two prohibitions, etc.@bo You might ask: There are three prohibitions, because there is also the prohibition, “Let the wife of the dead man not marry outside to a strange man” (below 25:5)! The answer is that these two prohibitions apply even after his father’s death, but the prohibition of “Let the wife of the dead man not marry outside to a strange man” applies only as long as he is alive. @d1To teach that the bastard is only, etc.@bo Rashi means that this is another reason why the Torah writes, “And he may not expose the edge of his father’s garment,” in order to juxtapose to it, “the bastard may not enter, etc.” You might ask that the verse, “One may not enter — with injured or crushed genitals, etc.,” interrupts between these two verses! The answer is since such people cannot have children and so they are unable to produce bastards, the verse [concerning them] is not considered an interruption. @d1As no act of incest or adultery subject to judicial execution, etc.@bo Rashi is saying that you should not ask: There is a rule that we cannot add extra punishments [or extra prohibitions to a transgression] through a @ITkal vachomer@it [and similarly we cannot add the status of a bastard to a child resulting from this transgression through a @ITkal vachomer@it]! He explains that “no act of incest, etc.” Therefore, since this transgression is liable to @ITkares@it, the child will be a bastard even without a @ITkal vachomer @itsince he is the result of a @ITkares@it prohibition. And the father’s prospective levirate partner is a @ITkares @itprohibition because she is his aunt. @p1[2]@p2<TIE>Whose testicles were injured or crushed.@bo Because afterwards it is written, “A base-born may not enter.” The@hh<HEB>פצוע דכא@it<ENG> is juxtaposed to the base-born to teach that just as the disqualification of the base-born resulted from the procreative organs, so too the disqualification of the @hh<HEB>פצוע דכא@it<ENG> is connected with the procreative organs.<QC>
@p1[3]@p2<TIE>He may not marry an Israelite woman.@bo You might ask: Why Rashi does not explain this above by @hh<HEB>פצוע דכא@it<ENG>? The answer is that Rashi’s intent here is not to explain the meaning of “Adonoy’s community,” as it is obvious that “Adonoy’s community” means to not marry an Israelite woman. Rather, Rashi is answering the question: Why is it written that “a base-born may not enter into Adonoy’s community,” as we would already know this from a @ITkal vachomer.@it If a @hh<HEB>פצוע דכא@it<ENG> who was not created through sin is forbidden to enter the community, how much more a base-born who was created through sin! Therefore he explains, “He may not marry an Israelite woman.” That is, even if he married her we force him to divorce her. But if a @hh<HEB>פצוע דכא@it<ENG> married her he does not have to divorce her. Therefore we cannot learn the base-born from the @hh<HEB>פצוע דכא@it<ENG> with a @ITkal vachomer @itbecause the rule is, “suffice it for that learnt from the @ITkal vachomer@it to be like the source.” @p1[4]@p2<TIE>He may not marry an Israelite woman.@bo You might ask: Rashi already said this before on the verse, “A base-born may not enter into Adonoy’s community”! The answer is that since Ammonite and Moavite males are forbidden to enter the community, but females are permitted to enter the community, Rashi has to explain that a male may not marry an Israelite woman, but [an Ammonite and Moavite] woman may marry an Israelite man. This too is why the verse had to write, regarding an Ammonite and Moavite, that they may not enter the community of Adonoy.<QC>
@p1[5]@p2<TIE>Because of their advice, etc.@bo Otherwise, why does it say @hh<HEB>דבר@it<ENG>, [which also means “word”]? It should have simply said “that they did not greet you, etc.”! Therefore we say it means as follows: “Because of the words,” i.e., the advice, that they did not greet you, etc., i.e. and also because of this thing too, “That they did not greet you, etc.” meaning, “that” actually means “@ITand@it that.” @p1[7]@p2<TIE>Perhaps this one as well, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Why would I think one should pursue their peace and benefit? He answers, “By inference from what is said, etc.” It seems to me that the correct text in Rashi is, “‘Do not pursue, etc.,” [omitting the words “their peace”], as he is explaining the latter part of the verse, where it says “and their good.” Because we learned in Sifrei: “Do not pursue their peace.” You might think that because it says (earlier 20:10), “When you near a city (to do battle against it, you are to offer it peace),” you might think the same applies here too. Therefore the verse says, “Do not pursue,” regardless [of what it said earlier]. “And their benefit.” And because it says (below v. 17), “do not distress him” you might think the same applies here too. Therefore the verse says, “And their benefit, etc.” The printers did not understand Rashi’s intention and omitted the word “etc.” [from the text] (Kitzur Mizrachi). @p1[8]@p2<TIE>Completely, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: It is written afterwards, “Children who will be born to them, in the third generation, will enter.” This implies that the second generation may not enter and if so he is despised! Why then does it say in the beginning, “Do not despise”? Rashi explains that when it is written, “Do not despise,” it means do not despise completely, but you may despise a bit. @d1Totally, etc.@bo Since it is written afterwards, “the third generation will enter,” this implies that the second generation may not enter. Why then does it say, “Do not despise the Egyptian”? Rashi answers that this is what it means, “‘Do not despise,’ totally,” but you may despise a bit, as I explained above regarding “do not despise the Edomite.” Rashi says here, [do not despise them] totally, because it says (Shmos 1:22) [that Pharaoh ordered], “Every boy who is born must be thrown into the river, but every daughter shall be allowed to live.” Even though they cast your males into the river, do not despise them [totally]. “What is the reason? Because, etc.” Therefore Rashi says here [do not despise them] totally. @d1What is the reason? Because they received you hospitably, etc.@bo There are those who ask: Why does Rashi have to explain the reason why the third generation may enter, for the verse itself explains the reason, “For you were a stranger, etc.”? The answer is that Rashi was questioning — should they [be allowed to] enter the community merely because you were a stranger in his land, after they perpetrated all this evil of killing your firstborn? Do other countries harboring foreigners kill their firstborn? Therefore Rashi explains, “What is the reason, etc.” [and he says that the Egyptians helped us]. This “what is the reason” is the explanation of “for you were a stranger” written in the verse. @p1[9]@p2<TIE>The other nations, however, are permitted immediately.@bo I.e., do not ask what punishment is it to delay them until the third generation? The same law applies to other nations as well! Therefore Rashi explains, “The other nations, etc.” @d1Someone who incites a man to sin is worse than someone who murders him, etc.@bo You might ask: Why are they not totally despised? If Amon and Moav who did nothing except to incite Israel to sin, and they were totally despised, why then were Edom and Egypt who wanted to kill them not totally despised? You cannot answer because [Amon and Moav] “did not greet you, etc.” (v. 5), since it is obvious that Edom too did not greet you, for otherwise, why does the verse say you should not despise Edom “for he is your brother,” and also not say the reason is because he met you, etc.? This indicates that this is not the main reason! You also cannot say the difference is that Moav hired Bilam to curse them while Edom did not hire Bilam, because perhaps Edom failed to hire Bilam only because Edom was not aware that whomever Bilam cursed was cursed, whereas Balak knew this from the war against Sichon, as Rashi explains above (Bamidbar 22:6). Thus there is no reason to show gratitude to Edom because of this. On the contrary, we should despise them more because they wanted to kill them by the sword. And if because he is your brother, Amon and Moav are also related to us, as Avraham said to Lot (Bereishis 13:8), “For we are kinsmen.” Rashi answers, “Thus we learn, etc.” @p1[11]@p2<TIE>Scriptural law is expressed in common circumstances.@bo Because it is common to have an emission at night but it is not common during the day. But, certainly if one has an emission during the day, he too will become defiled. @d1He is not permitted to enter the camp of the Levites, certainly not, etc.@bo Rashi means, because “camp” is written twice in the verse. You might ask that these two “camps,” are being used, one for a positive command and one for a negative command! Furthermore, why does Rashi learn the camp of the @ITShechinah@it from a @ITkol shekein@it? He should have [simply] said, “And he is not permitted to enter the camp of the Levites or the @ITShechinah@it.” The answer is that Rashi is saying as follows. When it is written, “He must go out of the camp,” this must mean the camp of @ITShechinah@it because why should we include any other camps? Afterwards when it is written, “He may not enter into the midst of the camp,” this includes even the camp of Levites. But this raises a difficulty, since one with the defilement of an emission enters the camp of @ITShechinah@it which has greater sanctity, transgresses only a positive command as it is written, “He must go out, etc.,” but if one enters the camp of the Levites which has less sanctity, one transgress a negative command, which is more severe than a positive command, as it is written, “He may not enter, etc.” [To resolve this difficulty] Rashi answers that if a negative command forbids one from entering the camp of Levites, then “certainly [too], he may not enter the camp of the @ITShechinah.@it”@IT@it You might ask that one is not permitted to derive [new laws that incur] punishment from a @ITkol shekein@it? The answer is that this rule only applies when the law is not hinted to in the Torah at all, but here it is written that he transgresses a positive command, and only the negative command has to be derived from a @ITkol shekein,@it in this case we would punish [someone who transgresses by using such a derivation]. @ITRe”m@it answers that the camp of the @ITShechinah@it and the camp of the Levites are both [forbidden] because of the sanctity of the @ITShechinah@it and are [therefore] regarded as one camp, etc., [and in such a case we can derive punishment from a @ITkol shekein@it]. See there where he discusses this at length. @p1[12]@p2<TIE>He does not become pure without the setting of the sun.@bo Meaning, he can certainly immerse himself whenever he wants [during] the entire day. But, Rashi wants to explain that when the verse writes, “As sunset nears he is to immerse in water,” you should not say that he cannot do so before this. Rather the verse is giving good advice as it writes afterwards, “And after the sun has set he may enter the midst of the camp.” Since before sunset he remains defiled, why then should he immerse himself when it is still broad daylight? Therefore Rashi says, “Close to the setting of the sun he should immerse himself, as he does not become pure, etc.<QC>
@p1[13]@p2<TIE>Outside the cloud.@bo You might ask: After Aharon died, the clouds of glory departed! The answer is that the Torah is not written in the order that events had taken place, and this was said before Aharon’s death. @p1[14]@p2<TIE>Aside from your other utensils.@bo I.e., you are to have a peg aside from your other utensils in order to dig with it. @p1[15]@p2<TIE>[Let] the Holy One, Blessed Is He [not see] disgraceful objects.@bo [He] Who is mentioned at the beginning of the verse. Because otherwise, [i.e., if the verse meant, “Disgraceful objects should not be seen with you”], @hh<HEB>לא יראה@it<ENG> should have had a @ITtzeirei@it under the @hh<HEB>יו"ד@it<ENG>. @p1[16]@p2<TIE>As Targum [Onkelos] renders, etc.@bo @hh<HEB>עבד עממין@it<ENG> (a slave of nations), meaning, a Jewish slave sold to non-Jews, as it says in Gittin (45a). According to this, why then does the verse call him a slave? He is a Jew! Therefore Rashi explains, “Another interpretation, etc.” But according to the alternative interpretation you might ask that since the term @hh<HEB>לא תסגיר@it<ENG> implies freedom, as it says (Gittin 53b), “From here [we say that] if someone sells his slave to a non-Jew or outside the Land [of Israel], he goes free,” if so, why does the verse use the expression @hh<HEB>לא תסגיר@it<ENG>, it should have said, “Do not enslave a slave to his master.” Therefore Rashi also needs the first interpretation.<QC>
@p1[18]@p2<TIE>For she, too, engages promiscuously, etc.@bo Rashi is saying: Do not regard this translation of Onkelos as a difficulty against me [that I said @hh<HEB>קדשה@it<ENG> means promiscuous], as I can answer that [Targum] Onkelos agrees with me for “she, too, engages promiscuously, etc.” And Rashi explains similarly afterwards [regarding the maidservant]. @p1[19]@p2<TIE>This adds alterations in form, etc.@bo You might ask, why Rashi leaves the opinion of Beis Hillel who said (Bava Kama 94a), “@ITThem@it but not their alterations in form,” and explain [the verse] according to Beis Shamai who expounds, “‘Even both’ to include their alterations in form”? The answer is that since the Gemora said that there is a difficulty also according to Beis Hillel, he therefore explains according to Beis Shamai. @p1[20]@p2<TIE>This prohibits the borrower.@bo Otherwise it should have written @hh<HEB>לא תשך@it<ENG>. [@hh<HEB>לא@it<ENG> @hh<HEB>תשיך@it<ENG> in the causative] implies that the borrower is causing the lender to extract interest from him. @p1[21]@p2<TIE>So that he transgresses, for this, two negative commandments and one positive commandment. @bo“You may not pay usury to your brother,” and, “To your brother you may not pay usury.” You might ask: There are three negative commandments, because it is written (Vayikra 19:14), “Before a blind person you shall not place a stumbling block.” The answer is that this negative commandment is a @hh<HEB>לאו שבכללות@it<ENG> (a negative general commandment that includes many different things), because [besides the verse’s simple meaning] we expound from it, “Someone who is blind regarding some matter,” i.e., you should not give someone bad advice, and we do not give lashes for [violating] a @hh<HEB>לאו שבכללות@it<ENG>. Alternatively, because they expound this as [also] meaning someone who was blind regarding some matter, they do not want to count it among the negative commandments [here]. @ITRe”m@it explains that he transgresses two negative commandments, the negative command of “You may not pay usury to your brother,” and the negative commandment of “Before a blind person you shall not place, etc.” He discusses this there at length. But what I have written, so I have found. @p1[22]@p2<TIE>For three festivals. The Rabbis derive this from Scripture, etc.@bo Because it is written earlier at the end of @ITparshas@it Re’ey (16:16), “in the festival of Matzos, and on the festival of Shovuos, and on the festival of Sukkos.” The verse [there] should only have said, “(Three times a year are all your males to be seen in the presence of Adonoy, your God), in the place that He chooses, and he shall not appear (in Adonoy’s) presence empty-handed),” [without mentioning the three festivals by name], because the beginning of the verse it is already written “three times a year” and probably refers to these three. So why is this stated? To allow a person three festivals to fulfill his vow. If he does not fulfill his vow within three festivals he will transgress a negative command and a positive command.<QC>
@p1[24]@p2<TIE>This specifies a positive commandment with the negative.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Scripture has already written above, “Do not delay in discharging it.” This indicates that one must fulfill his obligation! @p1[25]@p2<TIE>Scripture refers to a laborer.@bo Rashi goes on and explains: You should not ask from where one knows this, for it is written [afterwards], “But do not place it in your container.” From here [we derive] that the Torah refers only, etc. However, if he hired him to till or to hoe he may not eat. This indicates that Scripture is talking about a laborer during the harvest season. @d1However, etc., or to hoe.@bo Meaning, to remove the bad grapes from the good. @p1[26]@p2<TIE>With this, as well, Scripture refers to the laborer.@bo Because it is written, “But do not lift a sickle.” This indicates that Scripture is referring only to the time of harvest, [a time] when you reap and place into the owner’s receptacle. But, if he is hired to plow or for some other activity, he may not eat. This indicates that Scripture refers to the laborer.<QC>
@p1[1]@p2<TIE>He is then commanded to divorce her, etc.@bo Since the verse explains that “she did not find favor in his eyes because he found in her something lecherous.” This indicates that “he is then commanded, etc.” And [also], because it states the term @hh<HEB>והיה@it<ENG> which is an expression of certainty, i.e., a command. (Minchas Yehudah). [An alternative explanation]. Because it should have stated, “If he found in her something lecherous, he shall send her from his home.” Why is it written, “Should she not find favor in his eyes, etc.”? This indicates that the verse is teaching that you should not tell him that he can send her away even after a while, because in the meantime she might find favor in his eyes and he will not send her away. Therefore the Torah commands him to send her away [immediately]. [The text is reconstructed as follows: “Should he find in her something lecherous, she must not find favor in his eyes”]. I know what @ITRe”m@it had written and I do not want to be lengthy (Nachalas Yaakov). @p1[2]@p2<TIE>This one is not like the first one, etc.@bo Meaning, this second one who marries her is not like the first one who divorced her; @hh<HEB>בן זוגו@it<ENG> means “like him.” Otherwise, why does the verse write “another”? @p1[3]@p2<TIE>Scripture informs him that he will ultimately hate her, etc.@bo Otherwise it should have said, “@ITIf@it (@hh<HEB>אם@it<ENG>) her last husband hates her.” @p1[4]@p2<TIE>This adds the adulteress who was secluded [with the adulterer].@bo Rashi explains: Do not learn this verse according to its simple meaning as [a case] where she married someone [else], because if so, this would imply that he [the first husband] is forbidden to take her back only if he [the second husband] had relations with her, whereas he could take her back if she was divorced after betrothal (@hh<HEB>אירוסין@it<ENG>) [to her second husband]. But this is not so, because it is written, “If she leaves his home and goes and becomes (@hh<HEB>והיתה@it<ENG>) [a wife to another man],” and @hh<HEB>והיתה@it<ENG> implies @hh<HEB>הוייה@it<ENG>, which is an expression that indicates betrothal. This means that he may not take back his divorced wife even if she was only betrothed [to another man]. But if so, why does the Torah write, “After her having been defiled?” Therefore it must be to “add the adulteress who was secluded.” That is, since there is a doubt whether she was defiled, he may not have relations with her until he gives her the cursed waters to drink. Even though the Torah (Bamidbar 5) explicitly writes defilement regarding the prohibition of [such] an e, as the Gemora (Sotah 28a) says, “She has become defiled” is mentioned three times: one [to create a prohibition] for the adulterer, one for the husband, and one for [forbidding her to eat] @ITterumah,@it the Gemora (Yevamos 11b) answers that we need the verse here to establish this as a negative prohibition. @p1[5]@p2<TIE>One that is new to him, etc.@bo Otherwise it should have said, “When a man marries a virgin.” (Gur Aryeh) @d1However, those who return from the combat formations etc@bo. [Rashi] explains: When the verse writes “over him,” it is an exclusionary expression. Only “over him” may no matter connected with the military command be imposed, but over another person it may be imposed.<QC>
@d1Even for the sake of his home, etc.@bo [Rashi explains: The word “shall be” denotes adding on [another case]. Add to it another “shall be” like this one; i.e., someone who built a house and already inaugurated it or someone planted a vineyard and already redeemed it, but a year had not [yet] transpired from the inauguration or redemption. Their status is the same as a person who married a wife but a year has not yet transpired from their wedding; he does not budge from his place. The same applies to inauguration and redemption. @p1[6]@p2<TIE>If he demands security from him for his debt in court, etc.@bo Rashi means to say that “he may not secure as collateral” implies that he is not permitted to demand security from him in court. But this is not so because it was necessary for the Torah to command, “Return are you to return the pledge to him” (v. 13), which indicates that one is permitted to take security. Rashi answers that when it is written here, “He may not secure as collateral,” is in a case where originally he had lent him without security and “now he demands security, etc.” @d1He may not secure implements of food preparation.@bo Rashi is answering the question: It is written “For he is taking life as security,” which indicates anything used for food preparation. [You might ask] if so, why does it say “the upper and lower parts of a millstone,” [writing] only one of them would suffice, because they are both implements of food preparation? The answer is, to give a negative command for the upper part on its own and for the lower part on its own. Even though each needs the other, however since they are two [separate] implements one transgresses a negative command for each implement on its own. @p1[7]@p2<TIE>Through witnesses, and after a warning, etc.@bo Rashi says this as you might think that since the Torah [seemingly] makes this law dependent on the [victim] being found in the perpetrator’s hand [then this law applies] even if there were no witnesses when he stole him. Therefore Rashi tells us that generally, “to be found” generally means with witnesses. Otherwise, the perpetrator could claim that he did not steal him but that he sold himself. @p1[8]@p2<TIE>So as not to pluck the symptoms of defilement, etc.@bo Because by plucking the symptoms of defilement or by removing the plague itself, the @ITkohein@it is unable to detect whether it is pure or defiled. @p1[9]@p2<TIE>If you intend to take precautions, etc.@bo Otherwise what does this have to do with this [previous subject]? It seems to me that Rashi is answering an apparent redundancy of verse (v. 8) that deals with the leprosy affliction. Why does it say “to be extremely careful”? Regarding this he answers, “If you intend to take precautions to avoid suffering, etc.” @p1[10]@p2<TIE>You obligate your fellow.@bo And the expression @hh<HEB>תשה@it<ENG> is similar to (Shmos 22:24), “Do not act towards him as a creditor (@hh<HEB>כנושה@it<ENG>).” Targum [Onkelos] translates it as @hh<HEB>ארי תרשי@it<ENG>, and this too is an expression of owing money as it says (Bava Kama 46b), “From the person who owes you (@hh<HEB>ממארי רשותך@it<ENG>) accept bran [as payment].” I.e., accept even bran from your debtor. @d1The slightest debt.@bo But do not explain [the meaning of] the word @hh<HEB>מאומה@it<ENG> here as elsewhere in Scripture, where it means “nothing.” @p1[12]@p2<TIE>Do not repose with his collateral in your possession.@bo Because according to the verse’s plain meaning [i.e., lying on the object] would be forbidden [because it considered] as [collecting] interest.<QC>
@p1[14]@p2<TIE>In want of all things.@bo Meaning, the words @hh<HEB>תאב@it<ENG> and @hh<HEB>אבה@it<ENG> have similar meanings. @d1This refers to the alien settler, who eats meat which was not ritually slaughtered.@bo It is if the verse said, “Or from your converts, or from who are in your land, or in your gates.” And because “or in your gates” includes the alien settler, and “or from your converts” includes the righteous proselyte, and both are called “converts,” Rashi explains “in your gates” right after explaining “from your converts” and before explaining “in your land” which includes the rental fees for animals and tools, as they are not rental fees of the people themselves. However, it seems to me that Rashi explains “in your gates” before “in your land,” so that “in your land” includes the rental fee of animals and tools, etc. Because if not for “in your gates,” I would think that “in your land” comes to include the alien settler since that is more logical. @p1[15]@p2<TIE>He climbs a wall, or suspends himself from a tree.@bo Rashi (Bava Metzia 112a) explains that he puts his life at risk for him by going up on a high ramp, and puts himself in danger of falling, and suspends himself from a tree when he climbs it. @d1Regardless, except .<TIE>.<TIE>. swiftly, etc.@bo And even if he does cry out [one is punished]. If so, why does it say, “So that he should not cry out against you? [Rashi answers], “Except that punishment is swiftly dispatched, etc.” @p1[17]@p2<TIE>Not at the time of the loan.@bo Rashi has to explain this here, although he had explained this on the verse earlier (v. 6), “He may not secure as collateral,” so that you do not mistakenly say as follows: Why does Scripture say, “You may not secure as collateral, a widow’s garment” [unless you return it to her during the daytime when she needs it]? The verse had written earlier (v. 13), “Return are you to return to him at sunset”! [Therefore we must say] Scripture mentions “you may not secure as collateral” regarding a widow, to teach that that one is obligated to return it [when she needs it] even if one took it as collateral at the time of the loan. Therefore, [to prevent this erroneous interpretation], Rashi explains, “When it is not at the time of the loan.” But [if one took collateral] at the time of the loan he is not obligated to return it because the prohibition of “you may not secure as collateral” (@hh<HEB>לא תחבול@it<ENG>) applies only when it is [taken] not at the time of the loan. But at the time of the loan, since the person gives it willingly, the expression of @hh<HEB>חבלה@it<ENG> [which implies causing harm] is not applicable. The reason the verse says, “You may not secure as collateral, a widow’s garment,” [even though it could be derived from earlier verses], is to teach that [one cannot take it at all as collateral even if he returns it when she needs it] because it cannot be returned [to her every day as people would suspect the lender is having an improper relationship with her] as the Gemora says in chapter @ITHamekabel@it (Bava Metzia 115a). Alternatively, to teach that [the law pertaining to] the poor and the wealthy widow is the same, and one may not take collateral from either. @p1[19]@p2<TIE>But not a heap.@bo A heap is when it is the size of two @ITseah. @it@BOFrom here we derive that a sheaf containing two @BIseahs@BO etc.@bo Because if the Torah is particular about two @ITseah,@it what difference does it make if it is a heap or a sheaf? @d1This is added to include forgotten standing grainstalks, etc.@bo I.e., if the standing grainstalks do not contain two @ITseah.@it But if they contain two @ITseah@it it is not @ITshikchah@it, just as in the case of a “heap” that it is not @ITshikchah@it. @d1Although it came into his possession unintentionally, certainly, etc.@bo Meaning that when it was forgotten and before the owners realized it, poor people had immediately taken it without the owners’ intent. Even in such an instance the verse says, “In order that. . .will bless you.” Rashi’s proof that this case is talking without [the owners’] intent is since it is written, “In order that…will bless you, etc.” Because if it was with [the owners’] intent, why specifically here is it written “in order that…will bless you” more so than in other places where charity is mentioned? @p1[20]@p2<TIE>Do not remove its glory from it, etc.@bo Meaning, that you may not remove all its fruit to the point that its glory does not remain. The expression @hh<HEB>לא תפאר@it<ENG> [where the word “glory” means to remove the glory] is similar to the expression, “ @hh<HEB>כל תבואתי תשרש@it<ENG> (It would root out all my produce) (Iyuv 31:12),” which means to uproot [even though @hh<HEB>תשרש@it<ENG> means to take root]. @d1This refers to @BIshikchah.@bo I.e., the @ITshikchah@it of a tree. Since it is written “behind you,” it implies that that regarding for that which is behind you, there is a prohibition to return [for it]. @p1[21]@p2<TIE>What is the shoulder? Clusters atop one another, etc.@bo The middle stalk of the bunch is called a @ITshidra@it (spine) because it is similar to a person’s spine that joins together the ribs; similarly, joined to it are the smaller bunches that are called @ITpesigin. Pesigin@it means a piece, as the Targum Yerushalmi of, “He shall sever it into its pieces (@hh<HEB>לנתחיו@it<ENG>) (Vayikra 1:12),” is @hh<HEB>מפסיק יתיה לפסיגין@it<ENG>. When the @ITpesigin@it lie one upon the other, they are like a load lying on a person’s shoulders and therefore it is called “shoulder.” “Droplets” are when many grapes are joined at the end of the spine and drip (i.e., hang) downwards. All these do not go to the poor. But when there is no shoulder or droplets but only scattered grapes, these go to the poor (I found this interpretation). @ITRe”m@it explains: Anything lacking the shoulder and the droplets. These [that the poor may take] are the grapes that hang from the end of the branches that are [similar to the fruit] called @ITsevi’a@it in the Greek language. They neither have a “shoulder,” which are the @ITpesigin@it that [lie] one on the other, etc., nor do they have “droplets,” which are the grapes that hang on the spine of a bunch [i.e., there is only one bunch of grapes on the spine and not many “shoulders”]. The shoulder is called @ITpesiga@it because it [i.e. each one] separates between the other @ITkateif.@it This expression is similar to @hh<HEB>מפסיג ועולה@it<ENG> (Bava Kama 81a), which means “He he cuts [a breach in the vines] and goes up.” So far are the words of @ITRe”m@it. See above in parshas Kedoshim (Vayikra 19:10) where more is explained.<QC>
@p1[1]@p2<TIE>They will ultimately approach the court of justice, etc.@bo Meaning: It should have [simply] said, “And the two people who have the judgment come.” This indicates that the verse is saying that if men have a quarrel, they will ultimately bring it to court and be unable to reach a compromise except through judgment. @d1“Should the wicked one deserve flogging” (@HB<HEB>בן הכות@BO<ENG>), etc.@bo Like its Targum [@hh<HEB>בר חיבא לאלקאה@it<ENG>, that @hh<HEB>בן@it<ENG> means “son”]. Some explain that it is an expression of @hh<HEB>בינה@it<ENG>, understanding, because the person must have discernment. This excludes a deaf person, an insane person, or a minor. Some explain that it refers to the judge. I.e., if the judge understands that the person transgressed and deserves flogging (I found this interpretation). @d1A negative commandment unattached to a positive commandment.@bo But if it is attached to a positive commandment, one is not flogged. The same applies to a negative commandment that involves no physical action, or that is subject to warning of death by court, or that is subject to financial restitution, or a general negative commandment that includes many things, as stated in @ITmaseches @itMakos (13a).<QC>
@p1[2]@p2<TIE>And behind him, in the amount befitting a double crime, etc.@bo Thus there are three amounts befitting a crime, one at the front, i.e., a third at the front, and two measures from behind him. There are those who explain that@hh<HEB>כדי רשעתו @it<ENG> [which can be translated, “according to amount that makes him wicked”], is thirteen lashes, because a person is punishable when he reaches the age of thirteen. “Before him” mean opposite his heart, “behind him” on his back, [and he gets “the amount befitting a double crime” on his back] because those two measures are a fine. @d1This is not vocalized @hh<HEB>במספר@it<ENG>, etc.@bo I.e., with a @ITpasach@it under the @hh<HEB>ב'@it<ENG>. @d1Rather, the number which concludes and completes up to forty, etc.@bo I.e., one has to count and mention the number forty minus one; that is, one must not say “thirty-nine,” but “forty minus one.” The reason for [counting] this [way] is so that one does not forget and give him an additional lash, and transgress “lest he additionally flog him, etc.” Therefore he must say “forty minus one” in order for him to remember. This explains why Scripture mentions “forty,” and not thirty-nine. @p1[3]@p2<TIE>From here we derive that one is forbidden to strike one’s fellow.@bo Because here, where one initially gives lashes permissibly, nevertheless it is written to not flog his fellow additionally for nothing [and thereby he transgresses a negative command], so then certainly if one illegally flogs his fellow for nothing from the very start, he transgresses a negative commandment. @p1[4]@p2<TIE>But this applies as well to all domesticated animals, wild animals and fowl, etc.@bo Because we derive this by comparing the word “ox” to the word “ox,” [by means of a @ITgezeira shava@it] as explained above (22:10). @d1If so, why is the ox mentioned? To exclude man.@bo Meaning that since “ox” is imprecise, Scripture should simply write, “You may not muzzle while threshing.” @d1Perhaps one may muzzle it while outside?@bo Meaning that since “While it threshes” implies only while threshing, if so, “perhaps one may muzzle it while outside” while it is not threshing and afterwards be permitted to thresh with while it is muzzled, “the Torah therefore teaches, etc.” @d1The Torah therefore teaches, “You may not muzzle an ox,” anywhere, etc.@bo Otherwise it should have said, “You may not thresh with a muzzled ox,” which would imply that there is only a prohibition during actual threshing. But because it is written “you may not muzzle,” it implies anywhere. “While it threshes” comes to teach a different lesson as Rashi goes on and explains, “Then why is threshing stated, etc.” I explained similar to this in @ITparshas@it Eikev (above 11:25) on the verse, “No man will stand up to you, etc.”<QC>
@d1It excludes prying apart dates and figs, etc.@bo I.e., if one puts them on the roof to dry and they became attached to each other, and has to pry them apart if he wants to take them. For these types of work there is not even a mitzvah [to allow a worker to eat]. But with something done with produce whose work was not completed, even though he will not transgress a negative commandment, as is derived from “an ox and not a person,” nevertheless, it is a mitzvah to do so unless he made a special condition with the worker. But in these cases one does not even need [to make] a special condition. @p1[5]@p2<TIE>Together in their inheritance, etc.@bo I.e., only if they are “together in their inheritance,” meaning, that one inherits the other if one of them dies. This includes paternal brothers, but excludes maternal brothers who do not inherit one another. For all paternal relatives inherit a person, and not his maternal brothers. You might ask, why learn this from “together”? Why not derive it from a @ITgezeira shava@it by comparing “brothers” here to “brothers” by the sons of Yaakov? It is written here “brothers,” and it is written there (Bereishis 42:13), “Your servants are twelve @ITbrothers@it, the son of one man, etc.” Just as there [“brothers” are] paternal, so here too “brothers” are] paternal! The answer is that since we find that even relatives are called “brothers” as it is written (ibid 13:8), “For we are kinsmen (@hh<HEB>אנשים אחים@it<ENG>, lit. “people who are brothers”), you may have thought that even relatives are obligated to perform a levirate marriage, and as we find with Boaz. Therefore it is written “together,” together in their inheritance, etc. The Gemora in chapter 2 of Yevamos (17b) gives a different answer, see there. @ITRe”m@it cites it, see there.<QC>
@d1Scrutinize him — a son or daughter, etc.@bo Rashi means [that we derive this] because the verse writes @hh<HEB>אין@it<ENG> with a @hh<HEB>יו"ד@it<ENG> when it should have written @hh<HEB>אין@it<ENG> without a @hh<HEB>יו"ד@it<ENG> as it writes below (v. 7), @hh<HEB>מאן " יבמי@it<ENG> (my brother-in-law refuses)” without a @hh<HEB>יו"ד@it<ENG>. Therefore, because it is written with a @hh<HEB>יו"ד@it<ENG> we read it as @ITayin@it;@IT@it the@hh<HEB>אל"ף @it<ENG> is interchanged for an @hh<HEB>עי"ן@it<ENG>, and it is as if the verse wrote @hh<HEB>עין@it<ENG> (scrutinize). That is, “scrutinize him” whether he has “a son or daughter, etc.” for if so she is exempt from a levirate marriage and from @ITchalitzah. @p1[6]@p2<TIE>The oldest brother shall perform levirate marriage, etc.@bo I.e., it is a mitzvah for the oldest brother to perform a levirate marriage. You might ask that perhaps if there is no firstborn brother [still alive] the others are exempt from performing a levirate marriage? The answer is that if so, it should not have said, “If brothers reside together,” which teaches, “This excludes the wife of his brother who did not share his world,” as Rashi explains. Because if a non-firstborn brother does not perform levirate marriage, why would one need to exclude the wife of his brother who did not share his world? This would be obvious as he [the surviving brother] is not the firstborn? This certainly indicates that even a non-firstborn brother performs a levirate marriage, and when Scripture writes “firstborn,” it comes to teach you that it is a mitzvah for the oldest brother as Rashi explains. @d1This excludes the @BIeilonis,@BO who cannot bear children.@bo The verse is read as follows, “Marrying her to be his wife<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. He shall be the firstborn.” I.e., the one performing the levirate marriage shall be the firstborn. “When she is capable of bearing children,” i.e., that @ITyevamah@it should be capable of bearing children. This excludes the @ITeilonis@it etc. @d1Shall receive the deceased’s share in his father’s estate.@bo You say this means inheritance, or perhaps it only means that if his [i.e., the deceased brother’s] name was Yosef they call him [i.e., the child] Yosef, or [if his name was] Yochanan, they call him Yochanan. It says here “his [deceased] brother,” and it says there (Bereishis 48:6), “They shall be called by their brothers’ name with regard to their inheritance.” Just as there it is [with regard to] inheritance, so here too [it is in regard to] inheritance (Yevamos ibid). @d1This excludes the wife of a eunuch, whose name is already obliterated.@bo The Mishnah states in Yevamos (79b), “If he was a ‘sun’ eunuch,” and Rashi explains: That he was afflicted from his mother’s womb and never saw the sun in a state of being fit, neither may he perform @ITchalitzah@it nor may they perform @ITchalitzah@it to his wife. But if he was a “man” eunuch [i.e., castrated], who did have a time of being fit, he performs @ITchalitzah@it and they perform @ITchalitzah@it to his wife.” @p1[7]@p2<TIE>As Targum [Onkelos] translates, “To the portal of the court of law.”@bo This [translation of @hh<HEB>שער@it<ENG>] is not like, "In your cities (@hh<HEB>בשעריך@it<ENG>) may you eat it (Devarim 15:22),” which means city, because it is written, "to the judges," and the judges sit in the portal of the court of law. @p1[8]@p2<TIE>She, too, must speak in the sacred language.@bo We derive this through a @ITgezeira shava@it from [comparing] the words "and declare" (@hh<HEB>ואמר@it<ENG>) and "and say" (@hh<HEB>ואמרו@it<ENG>). It says here "and declare" (@hh<HEB>ואמר@it<ENG>), and it is written below in @ITparshas@it Ki Savo (27:14), "The Levites are to respond and say (@hh<HEB>ואמרו@it<ENG>) to every man, etc." Just as there it is in the sacred language, [so here it is in the sacred language]. And from where do we know this over there? We derive it from the words "respond (@hh<HEB>עניה@hh@ee<ENG>)," "respond (@hh<HEB>עניה@hh@ee<ENG>)." Since here it is written, "And the Levites are to respond (@hh<HEB>וענו@hh@ee<ENG>)," and in @ITparshas@it Yisro (Shmos 19:19) it says, "Moshe spoke and Hashem responded to him (@hh<HEB>יעננו@hh@ee<ENG>) with [His] voice." Just as there it was in the sacred language, so here it is in the sacred language. @p1[9]@p2<TIE>On the ground.@bo It means before him [i.e., in front of him], opposite his face, but not actually in his face. The reason for this is because "and spit" is connected to the earlier phrase, "in the sight of the judges," [to teach that there must be enough spit to be seen by the judges], and it is as if it said, "in front of the judges she shall spit." Thus the word @hh<HEB>בפניו@it<ENG> is left by itself and can only mean "before him." Since the spit must be specifically before him [in order to embarrass him], it is as if it is actually in his face. Therefore the verse writes @hh<HEB>בפניו@it<ENG> [which also means "in his face"] and not @hh<HEB>לפניו@it<ENG> [which would only mean "before him"]. @p1[10]@p2<TIE>It is a mitzvah incumbent on all those standing there etc.@bo [Rashi says this] since you might ask why the word "Yisroel" is needed? He answers, "It is a mitzvah, etc.," and "in Yisroel" means "in the assembly of Yisroel," that they should be there at the time of the @ITchalitzah@it in order to declare, "The divesture of the shoe." Even though it is written "the house of the divesture," the explanation is that the word "house" comes to be expounded, "He builds one house and not two houses," meaning that once he married his @ITyevamah,@it he may not perform levirate marriage with her co-wife. @p1[11]@p2<TIE>Ultimately, they will come to blows.@bo Otherwise it should have said, "If a man strikes his fellow, and the wife of one approaches, etc." He explains that through altercation, "ultimately they will come to blows." @d1No peace can result from altercation (@HB<HEB>מצות@BO<ENG>).@bo Rashi here uses the term @hh<HEB>מצה@it<ENG> and not @hh<HEB>ריב@it<ENG>, as he did earlier (v. 1), "Tranquility does not evolve from quarreling (@hh<HEB>מריבה@it<ENG>)," because he is citing the wording of each verse. Above it is written, "If a quarrel (@hh<HEB>ריב@it<ENG>) should occur" he uses the term @hh<HEB>מריבה@it<ENG>, and here where it is written, "If men engage in an altercation (@hh<HEB>ינצון@hh@ee<ENG>)," he uses @hh<HEB>מצות@it<ENG>. @p1[13]@p2<TIE>Weights.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Is it forbidden for one to have stones in his house? Rashi answers, "weights" that one weighs with, just as the @ITeipha@it (lit. basket) is the name of a measure [of volume], so too "stones" [is a word that means weights]. @d1Where the larger contradicts the smaller, etc.@bo For example, if both are a whole @ITmanah@it or both are a half @ITmanah@it but one contradicts the other, i.e., that one is large and one is small.<QC>
@p1[14]@p2<TIE>If you do this [you shall not have anything].@bo Otherwise, why do I need the word "@ITyou@it shall not have"? It should have said, "There shall not be in your pouch varying weight-stones,” and the verse “you shall not have” means, if you have varying weight-stones in your pouch, you will not have anything. And because it is not possible to say, “if you do this, etc.” unless you know the meaning of "large and small," therefore Rashi first explains "large and small," and afterwards [he explains] "you shall not to have," which is not according to the order [that the phrases appear] in the verse. @p1[15]@p2<TIE>If you fulfill this, you shall have, etc.@bo The later "you" is similar to the earlier "you" which is connected to punishment for the sin. So too the later "you" is connected to reward for the mitzvah.<QC>
@p1[17]@p2<TIE>And it is written afterward, “The malicious arrive, then comes mortification.”@bo I.e., the enemy will come and provoke you to battle, and you will suffer mortification. @p1[18]@p2<TIE>Another interpretation: The meaning is “cold,” as opposed to heat, etc.@bo I.e., just as everyone is afraid of a hot object, so too the nations had fear of you. But Amalek cooled you, and moderated you to tepidness (@hh<HEB>הפשירך@it<ENG>); an expression of tepid (@hh<HEB>פושרין@it<ENG>) water. @d1Although he was scalded, he cooled it for the others.@bo I.e., he made you seem cold to others. @d1Striking at the appendage — they severed the circumcision, [and flung it heavenward].@bo The organ that has the circumcision is like an appendage, and the meaning of @hh<HEB>מזנב@it<ENG> is to cut off your appendage, i.e., your circumcisions, and fling them heavenward. I.e., they insulted Heaven [as it were] by saying, "The mitzvah You commanded Your nation, Yisroel, how did it help them?!" @d1Enfeebled.@bo Because @hh<HEB>נחשלים@it<ENG> is derived from the word @hh<HEB>חלש@it<ENG> (feeble); we find many words whose letters are transposed such as @hh<HEB>כבש כשב@it<ENG> (sheep), and @hh<HEB>אפילות@it<ENG>, which Rashi explains at the end of @ITparshas@it Va’eira (Shmos 9:32) as meaning "wonder of wonders (@hh<HEB>פלאי פלאות@hh@ee<ENG>)," and similarly @hh<HEB>שמלה שלמה@it<ENG> (garment). @d1Because of their sins, as the cloud ejected them.@bo Those who were ejected by the cloud had their circumcisions severed by Amalek. @d1Amalek, of God, so as not to harm you.@bo [Rashi says this] so that you do not explain this as describing Yisroel, that Yisroel had no fear of Hashem, similar to "exhausted and weary" [that applies to Yisroel]. Therefore he explains, "Amalek, etc." They expound this from the punctuation that places a @ITkamatz@it under the @hh<HEB>יו"ד@it<ENG>, signifying that it is a past-tense verb similar to, "And when Yitzchok grew old (@hh<HEB>זקן@it<ENG>)” (Bereishis 27:1). If it was an adjective [referring to Yisroel], it should have been punctuated with a @ITsheva@it under the @hh<HEB>יו"ד@it<ENG>. @p1[19]@p2<TIE>Man and woman, etc.@bo I.e., you shall not leave any remembrance of Amalek that his remembrance clings to, so that people say, "This was of Amalek." Otherwise, it should have said "smite" [rather than "obliterate the memory"].<QC>
@p1[1]@p2<TIE>This teaches that they were not obligated to bring the first fruits, etc.@bo You might ask why did Rashi not explain this earlier in@IT parshas@it Shoftim (17:14) in the section [dealing with the appointing] a king, for there too it is written, “and inherit it and live in it”? The answer is that Rashi wants to explain why here it says, “And you inherit it and settle it.” For the [the law derived from these words] could be derived from the section dealing with [appointing] a king since we derive [from the term] “come” “come” from each other. Just as there they are not obligated [to appoint a king] until after the conquering and apportioning [the Land], so too here. And there is a tradition that this @ITgezeira shava@it is a halacha given to Moshe at Sinai as Rashi explains in @ITparshas@it Shelach Lecha (Bamidbar 15:18) regarding @ITchallah.@it [He comments there on the verse], “At your coming to the land,” that, “This [term] 'coming' is different from all the 'comings' in the Torah, etc. because Scripture specified with one of them, etc.” I.e., since it specified regarding [the obligation of appointing] a king, that it does not apply until after inheritance and settling [the Land], so too with all of them. Thus we see that this is an absolute @ITgezeira shava.@it And if so, why does the verse here need to write “and you inherit it and settle it”? Rashi answers, “This teaches that they were not obligated to bring the first fruits, etc.” Apparently this verse is talking about eating [fruits], so one might have thought there is an obligation to bring first fruits immediately [after arriving in the Land] before benefiting from them, as we say (Berachos 35a), “Whoever benefits from this world without a blessing is considered as if he committed sacrilege,” and we would not have applied the @ITgezeira shava@it from [appointing] a king. Therefore Rashi has to explain explicitly, “'And you inherit it and settle it,' [This teaches, etc.”] However, above in @ITparshas@it Shoftim [the verse also has to specify that it is only after settlement, as] we would not learn this from first fruits, because one might think that they are obligated to appoint a king immediately they enter the Land, because the king is appointed to lead them in war, and there is no greater need for this than during the conquest and apportionment, since that is the main time of war. Therefore the verse there has to explain [by saying], “And inherit it and settle in it,” that this [appointing] is only after conquest and apportionment, in order that they give credit for the conquest to the Holy One and not to a mortal king. @p1[2]@p2<TIE>But not all the first, etc.@bo This is the text in most books that are available to us. @ITRe”m@it asks on this: Why learn this law from “@ITof@it the first”? Derive it from the @ITgezeira shava@it of “land” “land,” that only fruits of the seven species are subject to “first fruits”? Also, why is it different here that we expound “@ITof@it the first” and not all the first to exclude, that not all trees are subject to the first fruit obligation, but only some of them. And why is @ITchallah@it (Bamidbar 15:21) different that we expound from “@ITof@it the first” but @ITnot@it @ITall@it the first, to exclude, that one may not make the whole dough @ITchallah. @itHe discusses this at length. See the Nachalas Yaakov at length. @d1The @BIaguri@BO olive, with its oil gathered inside.@bo You might ask: In @ITparshas@it Eikev (above 8:8), Rashi explains, “' oil, olives,' Its meaning is, olives that produce oil.” Why does Rashi not explain there as he explains here [that “oil, olives” means the @ITaguri@it olive]? The answer is that above he is discussing the praise of the Land of Israel; and regarding that he explains, “Olives that produce oil,” meaning that in other lands there are olives that do not produce oil, whereas in the Land of Israel, all its olives produce oil. But here he is discussing the verse dealing with the first fruits, and we bring only first fruits from the fruits of the Land of Israel by which the Land of Israel is extolled, as we derive from [the @ITgezeira shava@it of] “land,” “land,” and it is as if the verse had explicitly written these fruits in the @ITparsha@it of first fruits here as well. And here [too], “olive” means the olives of the Land of Israel and they all produce oil as Rashi explains in @ITparshas@it Eikev. If so, it is understandable why he explains [the further point that for the mitzvah of first fruits that must be from the very best, one must bring] “the @ITaguri@it olive, whose oil is gathered inside,” because there are olives whose oil oozes out during rainfall and these are not as good. Therefore Rashi explains, “The @ITaguri@it olive, etc.” This also answers the contradiction in @ITRe”m@it's words [where he seems to be saying that all the olives in the world produce oil]. @d1When a man enters his field.@bo Rashi is explaining why the verse says “first”? It should have said only, “You are to take of the fruits, etc.” @d1And notices the first fig to mature, he wraps, etc.@bo Not a fig in particular, but other species as well. The reason for mentioning a fig is because it ripens earlier than other fruits.<QC>
@p1[3]@p2<TIE>That you are not ungrateful.@bo Otherwise, why mention this? Does not the Holy One already know that he arrived to the Land? @hh<HEB>כפוי@it<ENG> [to turn the good upside down and ignore it] is derived from the expression @hh<HEB>הכפשני באפר@it<ENG>, “He turned me upside down in the ground” (Eicha 3:16). @d1Once each year, etc.@bo Meaning that if he had more than one species of fruit, and one species ripened faster than the second, and he brings the first one to Jerusalem and says the readings, and then when the second species matures he brings it too, he does not say a reading a second time. Rashi's proof is that it is written “today,” which implies a restriction; otherwise, why write “today”? @p1[4]@p2<TIE>Places his hand below the owner’s hand and waves.@bo I already explained [how Rashi knows this] in @ITparshas@it Tzav (Vayikra 7:30) and in @ITparshas@it Tetzaveh (Shmos 29:24) and in @ITparshas@it Emor (Vayikra 23:11). His proof is that it should have said, “The @ITkohein@it shall then take the basket and place it before the altar of Adonoy, etc.” Why does it say “from your hand”? Thus “from your hand” is available for a @ITgezeira shava@it. It says “hand” here and it says “hand” by the owner of a peace offering (ibid 7:30). Just as over there, there is waving, as it is specified there, so too, the “hand” over here involves waving. Regarding the waving here, Rashi explains in Chapter@IT Lulav Ve'arava@it (Sukkah 47b) that the owner holds the edge of the basket while the @ITkohein@it places his hands beneath the bottom of the basket. Even though regarding peace offerings, the @ITkohein@it puts his hand directly under the owner’s hand, that is because a peace offering has no edge or bottom, therefore the @ITkohein’s@it hand is directly under the owner’s hand. @p1[5]@p2<TIE>This denotes a loud proclamation.@bo But it does not denote [an expression of] answering or replying, because there cannot be a reply unless someone calls or asks, and here, who called to him or asked him anything? @d1He cites the Omnipresent’s benevolence, etc.@bo I.e., because he mentions the Holy One's benevolence, that He gave them this Land, he also mentions the other benevolences that He treated our forefathers. Otherwise, what connection is there between “the Aramite destroyed my forefather” and the first fruits? @d1Because he intended to act, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: If Lavan did not destroy him, why then is it written “destroyed,” which indicates that he did destroy him? @hh<HEB>אובד@it<ENG> is a verb acting on something else [i.e. saying that the Aramite destroyed Yaakov], as if it said @hh<HEB>מאבד@it<ENG>, [sought to destroy] even though this is not in accordance with proper grammar. So one has to explain according to this Midrash of the sages. @d1For with the nations, the Omnipresent equates, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: The Holy One does not equate thought with deed except for idolatry (Kiddushin 39b)! Therefore he explains, “For with the nations, etc.” I.e., even not in the case of idolatry He equates, etc., and only with Yisroel is it so [that He does not equate thought with deed]. @d1Yet others fell upon us to annihilate us, etc.@bo Rashi explains [the verse as follows]: The straightforward meaning implies that because the “Aramite destroyed my forefather” therefore “he descended to Egypt.” But this is not so. Therefore he explains “yet others, etc.” which is a separate matter.<QC>
@p1[9]@p2<TIE>As indicated by the plain connotation.@bo And therefore perforce “this place” refers to the Beis Hamikdosh. But if the explanation of “He gave us this land” is not according to its simple meaning, we could then explain that “to this place” means the Land of Israel. @p1[10]@p2<TIE>This teaches that he takes it after the kohein’s waving, etc.@bo Otherwise, why write “and you shall then place it”? It already said (v. 4) “and he will place it.” Rashi's proof that he “then waves it again,” is from here; that we derive “and you shall then @ITplace it@it” from “and he will @ITplace it@it before [the altar of] Adonoy.” Just as regarding “place it” in the beginning, he waved it before placing it down, so too, etc. @p1[11]@p2<TIE>Except during the time of rejoicing, etc.@bo Otherwise, what rejoicing is there that it is written “you shall rejoice, etc.”? It is not eaten by non-kohanim because its laws are derived from @ITterumah @it[which is forbidden to non-kohanim]? Therefore he explains, “From here they derive, etc.” Therefore, regarding the Levi and the proselyte too, you cannot explain as in @ITparshas@it Re'ei (above 12:18), that you are obligated to have them rejoice with you, since it is forbidden to them. Therefore he explains that they too are obligated in first fruits (Devek Tov). @d1If they planted in their cities.@bo I.e., within their forty-eight cities. @d1Who brings without reciting, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: The proselyte is obligated in all mitzvos of the Torah, is it then not obvious that he is obligated regarding the first fruits, and thus the verse should have written only, “You and the Levi”? He answers, “He brings without reciting,” and therefore the proselyte is specified separately.<QC>
@p1[12]@p2<TIE>When you finish setting aside the tithes, etc.@bo The meaning is not when you finish setting aside the tithes of the second year, as is implied by “in the third year” as meaning that you are in the third year and setting aside tithes of the second year. Because then it should have said, “When you finish tithing all the tithes of your produce [of] the third year.” Therefore one must explain that “in the third year” means “pertaining to the third year,” and the word is lacking a @hh<HEB>שי"ן@it<ENG>, as in the verse (Shmos 18:20), “The path [in which] they must walk.” The third year refers to the third year following @ITShemittah. @d1As it is said, “At the end of three years you shall remove, etc.”@bo Rashi wants to prove that the time of divesture and recitation is on the day before Pesach. This verse is written in @ITparshas@it Re'ei (above 14:28) relating to tithes. @d1Here, “at the end of” is said, and below, “at the end of seven years” is said, etc.@bo Not actually here in this @ITparsha.@it Rather, Rashi is saying that [the phrase] “at the end of” is said regarding the third year. Therefore, it is as if it is written here, because here too it talks about the tithe of the third year.<QC>
@d1The year when the tithing obligation is for only, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Why the verse calls the third year “the year of the tithe.”? Are the first and second years not years of tithes? He explains, “The year when the tithing obligation is for only, etc.” @d1Supply them with enough to satisfy them, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: If he does not want to eat, what can one do about it? Therefore he explains, “Supply them, etc.” Do what you are obligated to do. @d1Less than half a @BIkav@BO of wheat, etc.@bo Which is [the volume of] twelve eggs. But of barley one has to give him a [whole] @ITkav.@it And one only has to give him a half a @ITkav@it of wheat at the threshing area, because in town one does not have to give him a half @ITkav,@it because in town he can go to others as well. However, this is not the case regarding threshing areas because they are distant from each other.<QC>
@p1[13]@p2<TIE>Acknowledge that you gave your tithes.@bo That is, acknowledge in your heart [i.e. to yourself]. Otherwise, it should have said, “You shall declare @ITto@it Adonoy your God,” as it says above (v. 3) regarding the bringing of the first fruits. (Minchas Yehuda). Because if the verse is understood according to its simple meaning, what need is there to say [this] to the Holy One? It is already known to Him. (Nachalas Yaakov) @d1This refers to the second tithe and the fourth-year fruit.@bo As Rashi explains above in @ITparshas@it Kedoshim (Vayikra 19:24), that the second tithe and the fourth-year fruit are called “sacred.” @d1And teaches you that if one tarried with his two year tithes, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: There is no second tithe in the third year; if so, one should only declare the poor man’s tithe which is obligatory in the third year and continues until Pesach of the fourth year, as said above! Therefore he explains, “And teaches you, etc.” @d1This includes the @BIterumah@BO-gift, and the first fruits.@bo [In some texts] Rashi writes @ITterumos@it in the plural form to also include the @ITterumah@it taken from tithes as the Mishnah says at the end of Maaser Sheini (5:10). Rashi includes first fruits with @ITterumah,@it because, as Rabbeinu Shimshon explains there, the Torah writes (above 12:17), “the @ITterumah@it-separation of your hand,” and the sages (Makkos 17a) explain, “These are the first fruits.” Rashi mentions them explicitly because not everyone is knowledgeable of this teaching. @d1For @BIterumah@BO is entitled “the first, etc.”@bo Rashi wants to explain from where we know the Torah is particular about the order. @d1Of one species for another, etc.@bo For example, wheat for barley. @d1To bless you for the setting aside of tithes.@bo @ITRe”m@it writes: It means, from praising and blessing You at the time of setting aside the tithes. But it does not mean from reciting the [formal] blessing for the one who is setting aside tithes, because that [formal] blessing is a text instituted by the men of the Great Assembly, for the blessings upon [the performance of] @ITmitzvos@it are only Rabbinically ordained. @p1[14]@p2<TIE>From here we derive that it is forbidden during grief.@bo Otherwise, what difference does it make whether or not he ate [during grief]? Even though the declaration includes [all] tithes and @ITterumos@it as the sages expound from the earlier verse, “I have also presented it to the Levi, etc.,” [and if so, why do the sages apply this prohibition only to the second tithe?] Nevertheless, the word “of it” implies only one [type of] tithe, and this can only be the second tithe which is called “sacred” (Vayikra 27:30), [as the previous verse mentions the word “sacred”] (@ITKitzur Mizrachi@it). @d1Whether I was defiled and it was clean, etc.@bo That is, the @ITterumah@it, or I was clean and it was defiled.” @d1Where is the admonition concerning this?, etc.@bo You might ask: Why not say that the admonition is from here, as Rashi explained above, “From here we derive that it is forbidden during grief.” The answer is that the prohibition certainly is derived from here. Therefore the explanation of [Rashi's question], “Where is the admonition concerning this?” means, in order that he transgresses a negative commandment and be given lashes. But regarding eating in grief, there is only a prohibition and no lashes. And when it is written, “I did not eat of it when grieving,” it is merely relating a fact but it is not an admonition, because an admonition is only feasible when it comes from the Holy One's mouth [as a commandment]. Therefore Rashi explains, “Where is the admonition, etc.” @d1To make a casket or shrouds.@bo This teaching is a novelty; for even a casket or shrouds that are a mitzvah, and certainly secular purposes [are forbidden]. See @ITKitzur Mizrachi@it. @d1I have brought it to the Temple.@bo Otherwise, why write, “I have heeded the voice of Adonoy”? The person has already declared that he fulfilled all he was commanded and he did not transgress all that he was admonished against? For this reason too, they expounded from, “I have fulfilled everything that You commanded me,” [to mean,] “I rejoiced, and brought joy with it.” @d1I rejoiced, and brought joy with it.@bo That is, [to] others.<QC>
@p1[15]@p2<TIE>Now You fulfill what is incumbent upon You, etc.@bo Otherwise, what relevance has this prayer over here? Therefore [it means], “Because we have fulfilled, etc.” it is fitting for You to fulfill what You promised. At any rate it is a prayer, and not as @ITRe”m@it and Devek Tov write. @d1To give to us, and You fulfilled, etc.@bo By adding the words “to give to us,” Rashi is answering the question: The oath does not mention “a land flowing with milk and honey,” so how is it written here, “As You swore, etc.”? Therefore Rashi explains “to give to us.” That is, [You gave to us] as You swore to our forefathers you would give us, “and [also] You fulfilled” the promise you made to those who went out of Egypt to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, [which was] more than You had sworn to our forefathers.<QC>
@p1[16]@p2<TIE>A heavenly echo blesses him, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: This @ITparsha@it is certainly juxtaposed to the @ITparsha@it of first fruits. Therefore [the words], “You shall observe, etc.,” refer to the @ITparsha@it of first fruits. But how can “you shall observe and perform them, etc.” refer to the @ITparsha @itof first fruits if in the @ITparsha@it of first fruits it is written that he already completed the entire procedure and has already brought the first fruits, as is indicated by the verse, “View, from Your sacred residence, etc.”? Therefore Rashi explains, “A heavenly echo blesses him, etc.” (@ITRe”m@it). To me it seems that Rashi is answering the question: According to the verse's straightforward meaning, why is it written, “This very day, etc.”? Hashem already commanded this in the @ITparsha@it of@IT@it “Should you thoroughly heed My commandments” (above 11:13), and in the @ITparsha@it of “You are to love” (ibid 6:5). Perforce, the whole matter refers to bringing the first fruits, and if so, why is it written, “You shall observe and perform them”? What is it referring to? And how is it connected to, “Adonoy, you have distinguished today, etc.”? Therefore it must be that, “A heavenly echo blesses him, etc.” @p1[17]@p2<TIE>You have distinguished Him, from the alien gods, etc.@bo This is the explanation of, “You have distinguished today, etc.” @d1And He set you aside, for Himself, from the peoples of the earth, etc.@bo This is the explanation of, “And Adonoy has distinguished you, etc.” @d1It denotes glory, etc.@bo Thus @hh<HEB>האמרת@it<ENG> means “you glorified,” as in “All evildoers glorify themselves.” They glorify themselves that their [evil] way is successful (Rashi, Chagiga 3a).<QC>
@p1[1]@p2<TIE>This denotes constancy, etc.@bo Meaning, you should always keep this commandment. It is not an expression that denotes a command because if so, it would have been punctuated with a @ITsheva @itunderneath the @hh<HEB>שי"ן@it<ENG>. You also cannot say that it is an infinitive because then it should have said @hh<HEB>שמור תשמור@it<ENG>, as in @hh<HEB>פתוח תפתח@it<ENG> (above 15:8), @hh<HEB>נתון תתן@it<ENG> (ibid. v. 10). (@ITRe”m@it) @p1[2]@p2<TIE>There were three kinds of stones, etc.@bo Nothing can be proved from the verses here. Rather, everything is proved from the verses in Yehoshua. It is written there (4:2) that they erected twelve stones in the Jordan at the place where the @ITkohanim's@it feet stood, and they erected twelve stones in Gilgal, the first place they sojourned in the Land of Israel. And on those stones [of Gilgal] Yehoshua had previously written the whole Torah at Mount Eival. Because @ITsefer@it Yehoshua mentions these two types of stones, i.e. those of the Jordan and those of the Gilgal, Rashi therefore mentions them first, even though they [i.e. the ones of Gilgal] were first erected at Mount Eival. But because they removed them, and took and erected them in Gilgal, Rashi mentions them [those of the Jordan and the Gilgal] together. Regarding this Rashi writes “As stated in Tractate Sotah,” because that is where the verses of @ITsefer@it Yehoshua are cited. And when Rashi writes “three kinds of stones,” he means [two kinds at] three different sites. This answers the questions raised by @ITRe”m@it against Rashi from Tractate@IT@it Sotah Chapter@IT Eilu Ne'emarin. @p1[8]@p2<TIE>In seventy languages.@bo See above in @ITparshas@it Devarim (1:5) where I explained this (Minchas Yehuda). The reason it was written in seventy languages is explained in Tractate Sotah (35) that it is to enable the nations to copy it (Nachalas Yaakov). @p1[9]@p2<TIE>Each day let it appear to you, etc.@bo Rashi explains that because it is written “you @IThave@it become a people to Adonoy, your God,” instead of writing “you @ITwill@it become,” it indicates that it is referring to a previous covenant. And by writing “this day,” it hints that “Each day let it appear to you as if, on that very day, etc.” (@ITRe”m@it). It seems to me that this is deduced from “this day,” as in the verse “This very day, Adonoy, your God, commands you (26:16).” You cannot understand it according to its straightforward meaning, because on that day they accepted upon themselves the blessings and curses that would be said at Mount Gerizim and Mount Eival. And if that is the reason it says “this day” here, it should have first said, “Moshe commanded the people, etc.,” which is the @ITparsha@it of curses, and afterwards it should say the @ITparsha@it of “This very day.” It is not relevant to apply here [the rule], “There is no earlier or later in the Torah,” [i.e., the Torah was not written in chronological order] because this is the main reason that “This very day” is said. @p1[12]@p2<TIE>The Levi’im directed their faces toward Mount Gerizim, and began the blessing, etc.@bo You might ask: It is written “(The following will stand to bless the people, etc.) Shimon and Levi and Yehudah, [and Yisachar and Yoseif and Binyomin,]” and this implies that these six tribes said the blessing, not only the tribe of Levi! The answer is that that it is written, “And the following will stand @ITon@it (@hh<HEB>על@it<ENG>) the curse at Mount Eival.” “On the curse” must mean “next to the curse,” that is, that the @ITLevi'im@it turned their faces to them and therefore they are called “next to” [the @ITLevi'im@it] more than those standing on Mount Gerizim, even though the @ITLevi'im@it were equidistant from both. You cannot explain the verse according to its straightforward meaning, because you cannot say “the following will stand @ITon@it the curse,” as a curse is not something tangible that can be stood upon. Therefore, (@hh<HEB>על@it<ENG>) must mean “next to the curse,” i.e. next to those who say the curse. All this indicates that they themselves did not say the curses. Consequently, when it says [earlier], “These will stand to bless, etc.,” here too the tribes are not the ones who are actually saying the blessings. And now it is logical to say that they [the ones who said the blessing] were the tribe of Levi because it is written, “The @ITLevi’im@it are to respond, etc.,” and it is written afterwards [i.e. it says regarding those who stand by the curse who are mentioned after those who stand by the blessing] that they themselves did not say the blessing. You might ask: [If so], what is the meaning of what is written, “The following will stand to bless the people, etc.,” which implies that they themselves said the blessings”? The answer is that it means that the following should stand next to the @ITLevi'im@it on Mount Gerizim when the @ITLevi'im@it stand to bless the people, Shimon, etc. (This I found in the name of one of the @ITgedolim@it). It seems to me that his proof [that the Levites said the blessing] is because it is written, “The @ITLevi’im@it are to respond and say to every man of Yisroel, etc.” This indicates that the @ITLevi'im@it said the curses, and similarly they are the ones who said the blessings, because before saying “cursed is the man” they would say “blessed is the man.” You cannot say that when it is written, “The @ITLevi'im@it are to respond” it means that the @ITLevi'im@it proclaim [the blessing] first, and the people [respond] after them, because if so it should have said, “The @ITLevi'im@it and every man of Yisroel are to proclaim and say, etc.” And also, what is the meaning of the verse “say to every man of Yisroel” if they [Yisroel] themselves were among those saying the curse? Perforce the @ITLevi'im@it were the ones who said the blessings and curses, and they directed their faces as Rashi explains. And when it says, “The following will stand to bless the people, etc.,” it is as if it said, “These will stand on Mount Gerizim when the @ITLevi'im@it come to bless the people.” And who are the ones to stand on Mount Gerizim? “Shimon and Levi, etc.” You might ask that it is written, “The following will stand to bless the people, etc. Levi and Yehudah, etc.,” which indicates that Levi too stood on Mount Gerizim just like the other tribes, so how could Rashi explain that “the @ITkohanim@it and @ITLevi’im@it and the ark [were] below, at the center”? The answer is that there are two kinds of @ITLevi'im,@it those who are fit to serve, which is until they reach fifty years, and those who are not fit to serve, which is from fifty upwards. Those who were fit to serve stood below, while those who were not fit to serve stood on the mountain (Beraisa in Chapter@IT Eilu Ne'emarin,@it Sotah 37a).<QC>
@p1[18]@p2<TIE>Blind concerning a particular matter, and he offers ill advice.@bo We derive [our case of one who] misleads from misleads [i.e., the case of not putting a stumbling block before the blind] in @ITparshas @itKedoshim. And from where we derive that case itself? See @ITparshas@it Kedoshim (Vayikra 19:14). @p1[24]@p2<TIE>This refers to slander, etc.@bo Otherwise, why is it written “in secret”? If one would hit someone in public would it be permitted?! Is it not written, “He may not add; lest he additionally [flog him over these],” in @ITparshas@it Ki Seitzei (above 25:3)? @d1I have seen [this] in R’ Moshe Hadarshan’s commentary, etc.@bo You might ask: Why does Rashi mention [the comment of] R. Moshe Hadarshan for [the verse] “whoever strikes his fellow in secret”? The answer is that without this comment [i.e., saying that this verse is in regard to slander] the fact that the Torah writes eleven curses is no difficulty, as one could suggest it was done in order to remove Reuvein from [being represented among] the cursed because it is written, “Cursed is whoever has relations with his father’s-in-law wife,” and he disturbed his father's sleeping arrangement (Bereishis 35:22). Therefore there are only eleven curses in order to exclude Reuvein [who in any case is hinted at in this curse]. But now that we explain that striking one's fellow in secret refers to slander, if so, the Torah should have only said ten curses and [also] exclude Yoseif who slandered his brothers and spoke slander against them. Rashi answers, “I have seen, etc.” This is easy to understand. I have seen texts where Rashi writes “I have seen, etc.” on (v. 26), “Cursed is whoever does not uphold, etc.” The explanation of this [why he cites R' Moshe Hadarshan there] is as follows: “I have seen [this] in R’ Moshe Hadarshan’s commentary: There are eleven curses, etc. he, therefore, did not want to curse him.” [Rashi is answering that] you might ask: There are twelve curses, etc. if you include “Cursed is whoever does not uphold, etc.” Rashi explains that the verse here, “Cursed is whoever does not uphold etc,” encompasses the entire Torah and all the above curses are included in “Cursed is whoever does not uphold, etc.” But if so, you might ask that the above curses are superfluous and why were they written? But certainly [the answer is] as “I have seen in R’ Moshe Hadarshan’s commentary,” [that the eleven curses correspond to the tribes].<QC>
@p1[4]@p2<TIE>Why are they called @HB<HEB>עשתרות@BO<ENG>?@bo See above @ITparshas@it Eikev (7:13) where I have explained this. @p1[5]@p2<TIE>Liquids which you filter.@bo Meaning [liquids] such as wine and oil. @d1Solids, which remain in the utensil, etc.@bo Such as all varieties of fruits. It is called @hh<HEB>משארתך@it<ENG> because they remain (@hh<HEB>נשארים@it<ENG>) in the basket. According to the first explanation [that @hh<HEB>טנאך@it<ENG> means] “your fruit,” there is no explanation [in Rashi] of @hh<HEB>משארתיך@it<ENG>. You must resort to its plain meaning, similar to (Shmos 12:34), “(The people took their dough before it was leavened.) Their leftovers were wrapped in their clothing.” It is as if the verse said, “Blessed will be its fruits and its dough.” According to the first explanation you could ask why it does it not simply say fruit? Why does it say @hh<HEB>טנאך@it<ENG>? Therefore Rashi explains, “Another interpretation: Your basket — liquids which you filter etc.” But according to the “other interpretation” you might ask that the blessing of grapes [wine] is included in the blessing of fruits, so why does the Torah give it a separate blessing? And you cannot answer that the Torah gives it a separate blessing so that even in the event there is no blessing of plenty with the grapes, even so there will be plenty wine. This is not so because once there is a blessing of plenty for fruit in general, the grapes too are included, and there will probably be plenty of wine. Therefore he also needs the first explanation. @p1[6]@p2<TIE>For your departure from the world will be without sin, etc.@bo Meaning that just as your arrival to the world was without sin, so too your departure from the world will be without sin. Rashi's proof [for this interpretation] is that it first it is written “at your arrival” and afterwards “at your departure,” whereas the way of the world is to first depart from a house and afterwards to arrive [back home]. Also, why bless [only] one's arrival and departure, but not one's walking and other movements? Therefore he explains that the verse means to arrive without sin. The verse is saying as follows: You were blessed at your arrival for you had no sin, and so too you will be blessed at your departure that you will have no sin. You might ask, how do we explain the [verse dealing with the] curse where it also written first (v. 28) “Cursed are you upon your arrival,” since over there one cannot say, “Like your arrival into the world with sin,” as @ITRe”m@it questions. However, I found written in the name of the Mahara of Pragure that this is not difficult at all, as the verse means as follows: You will be cursed at your arrival just as at your departure. Just as you will certainly have sin at your departure, so too you will be cursed at your arrival, i.e., full of sin. You might ask, what sin could a newborn possibly commit? The answer is that the Holy One visits the sins of fathers onto sons. Much more has been said about this. It seems to me that one can answer this question in conjunction with what they said in Chapter @ITHamapeles@it (Niddah 30b): To what can an embryo be compared in its mother's womb? To a folded tablet, etc. and they teach it the entire Torah, etc.” Regarding this it says, “Cursed are you upon your arrival,” that just as you are caused to forget the entire Torah [at birth], so too, “cursed are you upon your departure,” as you will also forget all the Torah that you learn in this world. And the beginning of a person's judgment is, “Were you involved in Torah learning?” Another answer is that a person's arrival in this world is with wailing, because it is usual for a baby to cry when it emerges into the air of the world. So too when he departs the world it will also be with wailing. And this is a bad sign for him as it says (Kesuvos 103b): Someone who dies while laughing, it is a good sign for him; while wailing, it is a bad sign, etc.” This is easy to understand. (So it seems to me). @p1[7]@p2<TIE>By scattering in every direction.@bo Why then it is written “seven”? @ITRe”m@it explains that it is customary for “seven” to represent an expression of multiplicity, as in (Shmuel I 2:5), “Until the barren gives birth to @ITseven@it, etc.”<QC>
@p1[22]@p2<TIE>He will incite armed forces against you.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Until this point the verse lists various kinds of illnesses, but what sort of illness is the sword? He explains that this is a separate curse, that He will incite armed forces against you. Alternatively, Rashi is answering the question how does a sword strike of its own volition [which the verse implies]? @d1Injury to the crops in the field.@bo Rashi is answering the same question as before, what sort of illness is “@hh<HEB>שדפון וירקון@hh@ee<ENG>”? And he explains that these are injurious to the crops. Until now the verse lists illnesses afflicting the body and here it list plagues that afflict the crops. @d1Targum: @HB<HEB>עד דתיבד@BO<ENG>, meaning, etc.@bo Because according to its straightforward meaning, the verse implies that the Holy One will chase you until you are lost from Him, and someone else will find you. But this is impossible because if one is lost from the Holy One, who will find him and save him from His hand? Therefore he cites the Targum, @hh<HEB>עד דתיבד@it<ENG>, which is an expression of annihilation from the world. Then Rashi asks that if so, why mention a description of destruction? It should have simply said @hh<HEB>עד אבוד@it<ENG>, until annihilation? Regarding this he explains, “meaning, ‘until the annihilation of you.’” That is, if it had not written the @hh<HEB>ך'@it<ENG> that connects the verb to speak in the second person, you might have thought the word @hh<HEB>אבד@it<ENG> is an infinitive@IT,@it like @hh<HEB>אבד תאבדון@it<ENG>, “You must obliterate” (above 12:2), and its meaning is “until you will annihilate” something [of your own] as atonement for your sins. Therefore the Scripture adds the @hh<HEB>ך'@it<ENG> that converts the verb to speak in the second person, so that the word @hh<HEB>אבד@it<ENG> refers to the person spoken of, meaning, until you [yourself] are annihilated. Nevertheless, he [concludes and] explains that according to the Targum it means “until you are annihilated of yourself.” Examine this carefully. This answers what @ITRe”m@it wrote, “I do not know how to resolve what Rashi first writes @hh<HEB>עד דתיבד@it<ENG> [until the annihilation of you] and then writes @hh<HEB>עד אבוד אותך@it<ENG>, [until you destroy], which implies that this is the explanation of @hh<HEB>עד דתיבד@it<ENG>, but then he concludes, @hh<HEB>שתכלה מאליך@it<ENG>, “until you are annihilated of yourself,” which can only be going according to the Targum. @p1[23]@p2<TIE>These curses Moshe articulated himself, etc.@bo Meaning that Moshe asked the Holy One for permission to curse them this way, and the Holy One granted him permission. This resolves the Gemara's statement (Sanhedrin 99a) that Moshe did not innovate even one letter [in the Torah] on his own i.e., without permission from the Holy One. And when Rashi explains that Moshe “articulated himself,” he means that he first asked the Holy One [for permission]. Tosefos in Chapter@IT Bnei Ha'ir@it (Megilla 31b), [commenting on the Gemora there] write, “Moshe articulated himself, and through Divine Inspiration.” @d1It is said, “If you do not heed ‘Me’<HS><HS>” etc.@bo But if Moshe pronounced them, it would be impossible to say, “.<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>heed @ITme@it, etc.”<FJ> @d1Still, this is a curse, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question that if Moshe wanted to curse them, then, what curse is “The heavens above your head will be like copper”? @p1[24]@p2<TIE>When the wind follows a rainfall, etc.@bo This is the expression of the Gemora. Rashi is answering: How can it say that rain will turn into dust and soil which are two opposites, and to have two opposites in one situation is impossible! Therefore he explains, “When the wind follows, etc.” @d1Not enough to settle the dust, etc.@bo @hh<HEB>להרביץ@it<ENG> is similar to the expression (Shmos 23:5), “Lying (@hh<HEB>רובץ@it<ENG>) under its burden.” @p1[27]@p2<TIE>Extremely pernicious, etc.@bo Otherwise, why does it say “Egyptian boils”? It should have simply said “boils.” @d1Boils that are dry, like ceramics.@bo This is its meaning, because it is [also] written “with dry boils,” thus this indicates that @hh<HEB>גרב@it<ENG> means running boils. See above in @ITparshas@it Emor (Vayikra 21:20). @p1[29]@p2<TIE>Whatever you do will be subject to altercation.@bo You cannot say [the term @hh<HEB>עשוק@it<ENG> is related to] “You shall not withhold the wages (@hh<HEB>לא תעשוק@it<ENG>) of your fellow” (Vayikra 19:13), which means to withhold the wages of a hireling, as this has nothing to do with our @ITparsha.@it And robbery is already mentioned [in the word following]. Therefore Rashi explains the term (@hh<HEB>עשוק@it<ENG>) is related to (Bereishis 26:20), “He named the well @hh<HEB>עשק@hh@ee<ENG> [Quarrel], because they had quarreled with him.” @p1[30]@p2<TIE>The meaning is related to “mistress,”“concubine.”@bo [@hh<HEB>שגל@hh@ee<ENG> means] a woman who is a concubine. That is to say, “A woman will you marry” and another man will take her as his concubine. @d1But Scripture prefers a more refined term, etc.@bo Meaning that it should have said “will have relations with her,” but Scripture preferred this more refined term, @hh<HEB>ישגלנה@it<ENG>. That is, he will not lie with her like a harlot, but he will take her as a concubine. @d1This is the kind of refinement made by scribes.@bo I already explained this in @ITparshas@it Vayera (Bereishis 18:22). @p1[38]@p2<TIE>For this reason it is called, [lit.] the demolisher etc.@bo Elsewhere is the locust called @hh<HEB>חסיל@it<ENG>. Why? Because it destroys everything. @p1[40]@p2<TIE>Will discard its fruit, meaning the same as “And the iron discards.”@bo Rashi is not satisfied to say that that it (@hh<HEB>ישל@it<ENG>) means being discarded, because it is a verb applying to an object where the object, i.e., the fruits, are missing [from the sentence]. Therefore he says, “Will discard its fruit, meaning the same as 'And the iron discards (@hh<HEB>נשל@it<ENG>),'“ which is also a verb applying to an object and means that the iron will discard a piece from the wood being hewed, and it will go and kill him. (@ITRe”m@it)<QC>
@p1[42]@p2<TIE>A species of locusts, etc.@bo It is called @hh<HEB>צלצל@it<ENG>, an expression of “clanging cymbals (Tehillim 150:5),” because many of them come at once, and they come with resounding noise and commotion. @d1For, if so, it should have written @HB<HEB>יירש@BO<ENG>, etc.@bo With a @ITchirik@it under the first @hh<HEB>יו"ד@it<ENG>.<QC>
@p1[47]@p2<TIE>While you had every benefit.@bo Rashi makes the @hh<HEB>מ"ם@it<ENG> of @hh<HEB>מרוב@it<ENG> as if it were a @hh<HEB>בי"ת@it<ENG>, like the @hh<HEB>מ"ם@it<ENG> in “@hh<HEB>מסיני בא@it<ENG> (Adonoy came at Sinai) (below 55:2).” As if the verse said @hh<HEB>ברוב כל@it<ENG>, meaning, “while still in abundant affluence,” i.e., while you still had every benefit. @p1[49]@p2<TIE>Suddenly, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Is the eagle unable to come from nearby?! Therefore he explains, “suddenly, etc.” I.e., “as the eagle soars” is a separate phrase and does not refer to the adjacent “nation from afar, etc.” Rather, it refers to the beginning of the verse, “Adonoy will raise upon you a nation” suddenly “as the eagle soars, etc.”<QC>
@p1[52]@p2<TIE>The meaning is mastering, conquering.@bo And @hh<HEB>חומותיך@it<ENG> is missing a @hh<HEB>בי"ת@it<ENG>, since it should have written @hh<HEB>עד רדת בחומותיך@it<ENG>, as in the verse (Bereishis 1:26), @hh<HEB>וירדו בדגת הים@it<ENG>, “And let him dominate the fish of the sea.” [Rashi does not translate @hh<HEB>רדת@it<ENG> as “fall” or descend], because the expression of “descend” applies only to falling from a high place to a low place, and the walls are already standing low on the ground. Rashi therefore explains it as an expression of mastering or conquering. And though @hh<HEB>רדת@hh@ee<ENG> is of the same basic structure as @hh<HEB>שבת@hh@ee<ENG>, Rashi understands that this is one of the atypical words that often appear in the Torah. And though Scripture writes (Bamidbar 10:17), “[Then] the @ITMishkon@it was taken down (@hh<HEB>הורד@it<ENG>),” [and] (ibid. 1:51), “They shall take down (@hh<HEB>יורידו@it<ENG>) the @ITMishkon@it,” although the @ITMishkon@it stood on the ground, the word @hh<HEB>רדת@it<ENG> is different because it is a verb applying to the subject itself, whereas @hh<HEB>יורידו@it<ENG> and @hh<HEB>הורד@it<ENG> are verbs that apply to another object. @p1[53]@p2<TIE>Because they will lay siege to the city, etc.@bo It is not the siege that causes the starvation which leads to people eating the flesh of their sons. Rather, the siege causes torment and agony of starvation that leads to people eating the flesh of their sons. Thus the @hh<HEB>וי"ו@it<ENG> of @hh<HEB>ובמצוק@it<ENG> is superfluous like the @hh<HEB>וי"ו@it<ENG> of (Bereishis 36:24), “[These are the sons of Tzivon:] (@ITand@it) Ayoh and Anoh (@hh<HEB>ואיה וענה@it<ENG>).” @p1[54]@p2<TIE>So that he will begrudge his remaining children.@bo Meaning that his eye will be too stingy to give to them. And to whom will he be stingy? To those who are mentioned in the verse, “At his brother and at the wife of his bosom.” But it does not mean that he will be stingy, i.e., [to] himself, rather it his brother to whom he will refuse to give. @p1[60]@p2<TIE>The proof is that the following is written, “If you obey etc.”@bo But one cannot prove anything from the verse here where it is written, “which you dreaded,” because you could say that “which you dreaded” refers to the Egyptians and means as follows: “All the Egyptian diseases,” and which Egyptians? Those “which you dreaded.” Therefore Rashi has to prove this from “If you obey, etc.” @p1[61]@p2<TIE>The connotation is rising up.@bo The @hh<HEB>מ"ם@it<ENG> of this word is grammatical and indicates the plural. It is not an expression of concealment as in (Eicha 3:56), “Do not conceal (@hh<HEB>תעלם@it<ENG>) Your ear,” in which case it would be explained like (verse 59), “Adonoy will strike you with prodigious (@hh<HEB>והפלא@it<ENG>) blows,” i.e., they will be separate and hidden from every living thing, because if so, it should have been punctuated with a @ITshva@it under the @hh<HEB>עי"ן@it<ENG> as in the verse “Do not conceal (@hh<HEB>תעלם@it<ENG>) Your ear,” and “will hide their eyes” (@hh<HEB>העלם יעלימו@it<ENG>) (Vayikra 20:4). Furthermore, it should have said @hh<HEB>יעלימם ה' עליך@it<ENG>, since it is referring to the plagues. (@ITRe”m@it). This is difficult to understand because in all the texts @hh<HEB>יעלם@it<ENG> is punctuated with a @ITshva@it like @hh<HEB>העלם יעלימו@it<ENG> which is also punctuated with a @ITshva.@it Therefore we must say that Rashi does not differentiate between whether it is punctuated with a @ITshva@it or a @ITchataf shva@it, and his main proof is that it should have written @hh<HEB>יעלימם@it<ENG>. Alternatively, his proof is that if it was an expression of concealment, the phrase [following] “against you” would not be understandable. @p1[62]@p2<TIE>Few instead of many.@bo The verse is not saying that they will remain numerically few and will therefore be unable to stand up against your enemies, because if so, why [does the verse say] “(Instead of your having been) like the stars in the sky, multitudinous”? What difference is it if they were originally many or few? Rather, the verse is saying that they will become less and less, like the bulls offered during Sukkos. You also cannot say [Rashi means] that instead of being wondrously many they will now become wondrously few, because if so he should have said, “Few instead of @ITthe@it many,” which would imply instead of the many they were originally. Rashi should not have said “instead of many” which implies whoever [the many] may happen to be. (@ITRe”m@it). @p1[63]@p2<TIE>To your enemies, concerning you, to annihilate, etc.@bo Rashi adds “your enemies,” to tell us that the joy is connected with your enemies, i.e., the Holy One will bring joy to your enemies concerning you, etc. Otherwise, it should have said @hh<HEB>ישוש@it<ENG>, which would imply that He Himself rejoices. Also, Hashem does not rejoice at the downfall of the wicked (Megilla 10b). @p1[64]@p2<TIE>Not literally idolatry, etc.@bo Because it is impossible to say that the Holy One is informing them that they will serve idolatry.<QC>
@p1[66]@p2<TIE>This refers to one who depends on the bakeshop.@bo This is far worse that someone who purchases produce at the marketplace, because the person who purchases produce at the marketplace can buy a large quantity at once to supply him for a long time, unlike the one who depends on the bakeshop. And the curse is, perhaps on one occasion he will not find anything to buy and he will die of starvation.. @p1[67]@p2<TIE>That it were last evening.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Logic would dictate the opposite [of what the verse says], because it says in Bava Basra (16b), “When the sun is high, illness is relieved,” which indicates that illness is worse in the evening than in the morning! Regarding this he explains, “That it were @ITlast@it evening.” @d1For “the tribulations constantly increase etc.”@bo Rashi wants to prove [logically] why the explanation is as he said, and the explanation is not, “would that it were the evening @ITto come@it.” @p1[68]@p2<TIE>By ship, as captives.@bo Rashi adds the words “as captives,” because without adding this, sending them to Egypt in boats would not be a curse. (@ITRe”m@it). This was a greater curse than taking them by foot, as it was a terrible affliction, for they drowned themselves in the sea, as we find (Gittin 57b) regarding the four hundred children who drowned themselves in the sea. @d1You will be sold, through other sellers, etc.@bo That is, @hh<HEB>ונמכרתם@it<ENG> would be passive usage like (Esther 7:4), “For we are sold (@hh<HEB>נמכרנו@it<ENG>), I and my nation.” But because it is written @hh<HEB>והתמכרתם@it<ENG> in the reflexive usage, it indicates that you will seek to be sold but will be unable to do so because no one will buy. @p1[3]@p2<TIE><NHS><NHS>To recognize Hashem’s benevolence, etc.@bo But [the verse does not mean] not to know the great miracles and the signs and wonders, as the simple connotation of the verse implies, because regarding these the verse would not say “a knowledgeable mind, etc.” @d1I have heard: because on that day, etc.”@bo Rashi is explaining how it is possible that before this they did not have eyes and ears. @d1How is it that you are empowering your fellow tribesmen over it, etc.@bo That is, over the Torah. @p1[6]@p2<TIE>You now view yourselves in prominence and glory, etc.@bo And “to this place” means to this situation, i.e., this importance and greatness. According to the “another interpretation” too, it means to this importance. However, according to the first interpretation that explained “a knowledgeable mind” as meaning “To recognize Hashem’s benevolence,” that all your virtues, greatness and glory are from the Omniscient, the verse means: Since you have come to this level of recognizing that all your success is from the Omniscient and not from your hands, it is fitting that you observe the tenets of this covenant in order to succeed in everything you do. According to the second interpretation that explained “a knowledgeable mind” as meaning a mind to know and fathom his master's wisdom, the verse means: Since you have come to this level of fathoming Hashem's wisdom, from now on He will be exacting with you in observing mitzvos. Therefore it is fitting that you guard the tenets of this covenant, which are Hashem's mitzvos in order for you to succeed and not stumble in all that you do. @ITRe”m@it writes: But I do not how to fit in the verse “Sichon, king of Cheshbon, came out, etc.” between “Then when you came to this place” and “You are to guard, etc.,” because they [these two latter verses] are connected to one another. I think one can answer according to the first interpretation that explained, “You now view yourselves in greatness and glory,” [as follows: As an example of this viewing yourself in prominence and glory], you recognized Hashem's benevolence when “He struck great kings, Sichon and Og, Kings of the Emori, for his benevolence is everlasting” (Tehillim 136). Therefore, “do not rebel, etc.” And according to the second interpretation, the explanation is as follows: Now that you have reached this level of fathoming His wisdom, which is the Torah and the mitzvah, and also understand that you can gain every success through keeping the Torah and @ITmitzvos,@it that enabled you to smite the two kings of the Emori, therefore from now on it is only fitting that you guard the tenets, etc., in order to succeed in all that you will do. And if not you will not succeed because from now on He will be exacting.<QC>
@p1[9]@p2<TIE>This teaches that Moshe gathered them, etc.@bo You might ask: From where does Rashi know this? Perhaps he did not gather them but rather each one remained in his encampment and Moshe stood in the middle? Furthermore, why does Rashi explain To introduce them into the covenant”? This is explicitly written in the verse? The answer is that he explains to introduce them into the covenant as this proves that he gathered them together, since one cannot make a covenant except through a rite of passage as we see later (v. 11). If so, since the verse writes that He introduced them into a covenant, Moshe must have uprooted them from their place and gathered them together, in order to perform this rite of passage with them into the covenant. @d1On the day that he died, to introduce them into the covenant.@bo Since it is written this day it implies, this day my years are complete, i.e., this day I will die. ([See] @ITRe”m@it). Alternatively, if you do not say this, why did he gather them now more than during the entire forty years? It is understandable if it was the day of his death, because if not now, then when? But if it was not the day of his death, why [do it] now more than the entire forty years? @d1Your chieftains of your tribes.@bo Otherwise, if it means your chieftains @ITand@it your tribes, each category by itself, why mention the chieftains at all? Once it writes your tribes the chieftains are included? And also, why mention the other details since all are included in your tribes”? This is no difficulty if the verse means your chieftains of your tribes, for you can say that the verse first mentions your chieftains, then your elders, afterwards your law officers, and afterwards all of Yisrael, i.e., the more prominent being listed first. But if your chieftains and your tribes are two entities, why mention chieftains at all? And if you ask: Why does it write @hh<HEB>ראשיכם@it<ENG> (your chieftains) and not @hh<HEB>ראשי שבטיכם@it<ENG> (the chieftains of your tribes)? The answer is to teach us that the prince of the generation is equal to the entire generation. @p1[10]@p2<TIE>This teaches that Canaanites came to convert during the days of Moshe, etc.@bo It does not mean to say that they deceived Moshe as they [later] deceived Yehoshua, for God forbid that they deceived the one [i.e., Moshe] of whom it says In My entire house he is trusted (Bamidbar 12:7). Rather, they came to him to make peace with him, but he did not receive them [by making a covenant with them], rather he assigned them to serve as wood cutters and water drawers. And the explanation of they @ITtoo@it, etc, is that they came, but not that they were able to deceive him. @p1[11]@p2<TIE>So that you pass into the covenant.@bo I.e., you yourself must pass and not through others. And thus he explains afterwards: But it would be improper to interpret this, etc., i.e., through others. Because if so, how could it say Into the covenant of Hashem, your God, if one explains it to mean to be passed through by others, [since a covenant implies mutual consent]? Furthermore, how can one explain that it means to be passed through? For this would serve notice against acceptance of the covenant, for they could say, We were coerced! @d1But, rather, as “for your performance of them.”@bo This means to do them, i.e., you of your own volition and not through others.<QC>
@p1[12]@p2<TIE>He has committed Himself with such great effort, etc.@bo Rashi has the following difficulty: You cannot say that this In order,, etc. is the reason He ratified the covenant with them, because the reason He ratified the covenant with them is stated afterwards (v. 17) where it says, Perhaps there is among you a man or a woman or a family or a tribe,, etc. If so, what is this in order referring to? Rashi therefore explains, He has committed himself with such great effort, etc. I.e., the verse is answering the question why the Holy One made the effort of binding them by oath. He should simply have given them a commandment and if they listened well and good, and if not, He will punish them as with all the other commands. However, he committed Himself with such great effort because He already swore to your forefathers not to exchange, etc. Therefore He had to bring them, etc. @d1While the imprecations and the suffering sustain you and stand you before Him, etc.@bo Meaning that through the imprecations you are careful to never transgress the commandments. And furthermore, they atone for sins so that you live and persist eternally. And similarly they said in the first chapter of Avoda Zara (4a) and in @ITmaseches@it Berachos (5a). @d1The chapter above this, as well, is conciliatory, etc.@bo Rashi proves that Moshe was telling them conciliatory remarks so that you do not ask: How could he be speaking conciliatory words if the whole @ITparsha@it implies [that he was giving] rebuke, and also above it, everything is rebuke?! @d1Because the Israelites were passing from one leader to the next, etc.@bo Because according to the first interpretation you might ask that the language of the @ITparsha@it indicates that this is rebuke and not conciliation. Therefore he offers another interpretation. But according to the other interpretation you might ask why it says You stand @ITthis day@it? Why does the verse write this day?<QC>
@p1[14]@p2<TIE>Even with the generations destined for the future.@bo You cannot explain the verse according to its straightforward connotation, that those who are not here had left, because it is written, “You stand, this day @ITall@it of you. Also, you could [refute this explanation and] say: How can one contract a covenant with someone who is not present? Perhaps if he came back from where he went and was here, he would not accept the covenant! But if it refers to those who will be in the future, there is no difficulty as even if their bodies were not there, their souls were there and accepted the covenant. Another explanation is that “a son is the extension [lit., leg] of his father,” and being that the fathers accepted [the covenant], the sons who come after them are also included in the covenant. @p1[15]@p2<TIE>Since you have observed the idolatrous Gentile nations, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: What reason is this for what comes before [in the previous verse], And with those who are not here, etc. Therefore he explains, Since you have observed, etc., therefore, I am compelled to adjure you. I.e., this is a reason for what comes before the previous verses, For your passage into the covenant, etc. (v. 11). It is explaining why the Holy One suspected that Yisroel might serve idols and made it necessary for them take an oath regarding this. The reason he suspected them was what he says here, Because you are aware, etc. These two verses, For you are aware, etc., and Where you observed their abominations, etc., are connected to the verse Perhaps there is among you, etc. that follows them, and the word @hh<HEB>פן@it<ENG> is missing a @hh<HEB>ויו@it<ENG> (and). That is why [in some texts] Rashi explains Where you observed, etc. after Perhaps there is among you. @p1[16]@p2<TIE>Those of wood and stone, you saw in the open, etc.@bo Rashi is explaining why the verse altered its wording and wrote you observed regarding wood and stone, but does not write you observed regarding gold and silver. @p1[17]@p2<TIE>In case there is among you.@bo Some people ask: It is written above in @ITparshas@it Va'eschanan (4:9), Lest you forget the words, and, Lest you raise your eyes heavenward (ibid. 19), and in @ITparshas@it Eikev (above 11:16), Lest your heart be misled, yet over there, Rashi does not explain that it means perhaps. According to @ITRe”m@it's explanation that this perhaps there is among you is part of Rashi's words and not that he is coming to explain it, but citing it [as part of his sentence] to explain the composition of the verse, there is no difficulty at all. Even without this, you can answer that Rashi explains the meaning of @hh<HEB>פן@it<ENG> here and not above, is because above it connotes a negative commandment as they said (Zevachim 106a), Wherever it says @hh<HEB>השמר@it<ENG>, @hh<HEB>פן@it<ENG>, or @hh<HEB>אל@it<ENG>, it connotes a negative commandment. But here one cannot explain that it is a negative commandment, i.e., that one should not do this, because it is written Perhaps there is among you, which is speaking of a case where such people are already present. Therefore Rashi explains that [here] it connotes “in case” [i.e. perhaps]. @d1Whose thoughts stray today.@bo This is part of Rashi's text, not that Rashi is now explaining the [beginning of] the verse, Perhaps there is among you, etc., [someone] whose thoughts stray, etc. [Because Rashi is actually explaining the second part of the verse, Perhaps there is within you a root producing gall and bitter fruit.] Otherwise, [i.e., if you claim that Rashi is explaining the first part of the verse], the difficulty arises that Rashi already explained [the first part of the verse] above (v. 15) [when he explained, “Perhaps there is, among you, etc.” “Perhaps someone among you has been tempted to follow them.”] Also, our verse seems to be talking about idolatry so how can Rashi explain that it is talking about accepting the covenant”? Thus one must say that [whose thoughts stray today] is part of Rashi's text. Rashi is discussing the words, Perhaps there is within you a root producing gall, etc. and not the words, Perhaps there is among you a man or a woman, etc., because he wants to answer why the Torah writes, Perhaps there is within you, etc. twice. He explains that the reason it is written a second time is because the first instance is talking about idolatry and the second instance [is talking] about accepting the covenant. It is as if the verse says, Perhaps there is among you whose heart strays today from Hashem to go after idols, or perhaps there is among you whose heart strays today from accepting the yoke of the covenant, and thus the word today applies to both of them, because neither of them wants to accept the covenant. [@ITRe”m@it] @d1A root nurturing bitter herbs, like the bitter gidin herb.@bo [The latter is] a species of bitter herb. And similarly, the Targum Yonasan translates Bitter as @ITla'anah@it in Mishlei (5:4), and @ITla’anah@it and @ITrosh@it in Eicha (3:19) as @ITgidin.@it  @p1[18]@p2<TIE>He will imagine blessings of tranquility, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Even if [the person imagines that] no oath-curse will affect him, why should this be considered a blessing if it confers him no benefit, i.e., the great good [that results from a blessing]? Therefore Rashi explains blessings of tranquility, i.e., when there is peace that is a blessing as it is written (Tehillim 29:11), Hashem will bless his people with peace. He will imagine this blessing of tranquility. @d1Because I shall punish him additionally, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: The verse I shall follow what my thoughts envision” implies that his sins are intentional; if so, what is the meaning of that the unintentional may be added”? Rashi answers, Because I shall punish him additionally. @d1Now, however, he has provoked me into combining them with the intentionally sinful, etc.@bo With this, Rashi emends a number of things. He explains that the term @hh<HEB>ספות@it<ENG> connotes adding and not destruction as in lest you be swept away (@hh<HEB>תספה@it<ENG>) (Bereishis 19:17). He also alters the verse by saying @hh<HEB>למען שאוסיף@it<ENG> (lit. so that I will add), because @hh<HEB>ספות@it<ENG> is a gerund and could be interpreted as meaning that that transgressor will add. He also adds the word him, because without the word him, we would not understand to whom He is adding. If Rashi had not explained that I shall punish him additionally, one could understand that adding unintentional acts to intentional acts means that the intentional acts will be regarded as unintentional, or vice versa. The explanation of [word so that in the] verse is as follows, that his acts of following what his thoughts envision will be reason for Me to add the punishment for his unintentional sins to the punishment of his intentional sins. @p1[19]@p2<TIE>Adherence to the vengeance mode, etc.@bo Rashi is explaining how the word @hh<HEB>קנאה@it<ENG> connotes revenge. See above at the beginning of @ITparshas@it Pinchas (Bamidbar 25:11) where this is well explained.<QC>
@p1[25]@p2<TIE>They had no notion that they possessed Divine omnipotence.@bo [In some texts] Rashi explains the text out of order because he wants to prove that when the verse writes unknown to them, it means, They had no notion that they possessed Divine omnipotence. Because once Rashi explains the verse that Which He had not apportioned to them means He did not allot them as their portion, it is obvious that they were unknown to them. If so, why does the verse write unknown to them”? Therefore we must say it means they had no notion that they possessed Divine omnipotence. @ITRe”m@it explains that [Rashi explains the verse out of order] because the verse [too] should have written, “gods [which] He had not apportioned to them and were unknown to them, in order to first say that they prostrated themselves to those gods not because Hashem had allotted them as their portion. And afterwards he adds that they also did not choose them of themselves for they saw that they possessed Divine omnipotence. @p1[28]@p2<TIE>If you should ask, What are we capable of doing? etc.@bo Rashi is explaining the relevance of the hidden [matters], etc. in this @ITparsha.@it As it is said, “Perhaps there is, among you a man, etc. This implies that an individual sinned. But afterwards [it is written], They will see the plagues of that land, which implies that the entire land will be punished on account of him. @d1That, even with regard to what is exposed [the community was not punished] until they had crossed the Yarden, etc.@bo Rashi explains that if not for the dots one would think that this has always been Hashem’s attribute, so the dots come here [for us] to expound that when it says ours and our children’s, that this attribute did not apply until now, but only from now on [i.e., once they cross the Yarden], because dots always come to exclude. You might ask that the dots should only appear on Hashem's Name [in this verse], as this would clearly indicate that [without the dots, certain] sins are Hashem our God’s, and with the dots it would also indicate that [certain] sins are ours and not Hashem's. How is this so? To to teach that, even with regard to what is exposed, etc. You might ask why there is a dot on the @hh<HEB>עין@it<ENG> of @hh<HEB>עד@it<ENG> (forever)? The answer is that there is a dot on the @hh<HEB>עין@it<ENG> of @hh<HEB>עד@it<ENG> so that [a total of] eleven letters have dots, corresponding to the eleven dots of Hashem's name [in the verse], to teach you that the dots should have been on Hashem’s Name to exclude [what is exposed, etc.], but it is not proper to put dots on Hashem’a Name. (I found this in the name of Maharitz). @ITRe”m@it writes that the dot on @hh<HEB>עד@it<ENG> is to indicate that this word @hh<HEB>עד@it<ENG> should not be here but next to the hidden [matters], to indicate that this rule [that the public is not punished for hidden matters] is [in effect] for all time [even before crossing the Yarden]. Even though we would know that it refers to the hidden matters and not the exposed matters as explained above [because of the other dots], nevertheless, were it not for the dot on @hh<HEB>עד@it<ENG> that teaches that it is written out of place, it would have seemed like an error because it is written next to the revealed matters. But once it has the dot, it is as if the Torah explicitly writes that its place is not here but above. You might ask, why was [the public] punished in the incident of Achan? The Gemora (Sanhedrin 43b) already answers because his wife and children knew [of his sin].<QC>
@p1[3]@p2<TIE>As it is said, “You shall be plucked, etc.@bo This prophecy was said regarding the exile of Bavel. @p1[11]@p2<TIE>It is not concealed, etc.@bo You might ask that in @ITparshas@it Va’eira (Shmos 8:18), Rashi comments on the@hh<HEB> @it<ENG>verse @hh<HEB>והפלתי@it<ENG> (I will set apart) that it is an expression that connotes separation [and he then adds, support from our verse], “It is not @hh<HEB>נפלאת@it<ENG> (separate) from You, etc.” But here Rashi explains that it is an expression of concealment. @ITRe”m@it already answered this question in @ITparshas@it Shoftim (above 17:8) on the verse If a matter of law is too abstruse (@hh<HEB>יפלא@it<ENG>), [where] Rashi explains that @hh<HEB>הפלאה@it<ENG> always denotes separation, or setting apart, etc. See there. @p1[12]@p2<TIE>For if it were in heaven, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: The beginning of the verse and the end of the verse apparently contradict each other. At the beginning it is written, It is not in heaven, [for you] to say, ‘Who will go up to heaven for us, etc.’ This implies: [that it is not in heaven], but near enough to send a messenger for it. It [also] implies that it is not that close that you do not [even] need to send a messenger for it. But afterwards it is written, For the matter is extremely close to you, etc., implying that one does not even need a messenger. Therefore Rashi explains, 'It is not in heaven,' (For if it were in heaven, @ITyou@it would be required to ascend in quest of it). But if it were in heaven it would be impossible to send a messenger after it and if you wanted to study it, you yourself would have to go up for it. Therefore there is no [longer] a problem when it is written [afterwards], For the matter is extremely close to you, [because the beginning of the verse too, is talking about the person himself and now it is saying that, on the contrary, it is close to the person himself]. And when the verse says “[Who will go up to heaven for us], and acquire it for us, [which implies that we are dealing with a messenger], it is adding even more, that [you might mistakenly think that] not only could @ITyou@it certainly never travel or go up to study it there, but you would never find any person to go up or travel [over the sea] in order to bring so as to study it. @p1[14]@p2<TIE>The Torah was presented to you in written and oral form.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Even when the Torah is in front of us it is difficult to understand because of the depth of the subject matter and the shortcoming of the one studying it! Regarding this he explains, The Torah was presented (to you) in written and oral form, and therefore the understanding of the written Torah is very plausible [if one studies it] in conjunction with the Oral Torah. @p1[15]@p2<TIE>If you act with goodness, then you have life, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: The verse should have mentioned each thing and its opposite, life and death, and good and bad, as it does below (v. 19). Furthermore, See, I have placed before you, etc. implies that man's acts of goodness are in Hashem's hand, but this is not so because they say (Megilla 25a), Everything is in the hand of Heaven except for fear of Heaven. Therefore Rashi explains, “One hinges on the other — If you act, etc. meaning that if on your account do good, etc., I will give you life, but if on your own you do bad, I will give you death. Because it in your hands to choose of the good or of the bad, and you choose from whichever you want.<QC>
@p1[19]@p2<TIE>So that when evil befalls you, etc.@bo Rashi wants to answer: They had not yet done anything [bad], so for what could they be invoked as witnesses? He explains, So that when evil befalls you, etc. I.e., they serve as witnesses to Hashem's warning. @d1Another interpretation of “I invoke as witnesses, etc. The Holy One, may He be blessed, said,” etc.@bo Because according to first interpretation you might ask that it should have said, I warn you @ITbefore@it heaven and earth, because they are to serve as witnesses to the warning. Therefore he says, Another interpretation, etc. And according to the other interpretation you might ask why the verse says @hh<HEB>העדותי@it<ENG> which is an expression that denotes testimony or warning. Therefore he also says the first interpretation.<QC>
@p1[2]@p2<TIE>This explains I cannot any longer, etc.@bo It is as if he said, Because Hashem has said to me, ‘You will not cross over [the Yardein], etc. Yehoshua will cross.’ But it is not because his strength had weakened, for it is written, His appearance was not dulled and his freshness did not fade [Devarim 34:7]. For one cannot say, for Hashem is [a phrase] on its own, as if it had said, I am no longer able, and furthermore, for Hashem said to me, because the meaning of I am no longer able is I have no permission, if so that is the meaning of that the Holy One, Blessed Is He said to me do not cross. Therefore [Rashi] explains that for Hashem said is an explanation. As if to say, I am no longer able @ITbecause@it Hashem said, etc. The [letter] @ITvav@it [meaning and] of And Hashem means because, as in [the verse] And there was no man (Bereishis 2:5) which means Because there was no man. @d1This teaches that he was sealed off from the masoretic teachings, etc.@bo The reason is so that he should not be upset that the greatness was taken from him and given to Yehoshua. For once the traditions of wisdom were blocked from him, why would [he wish to continue to] live? If you ask: Why does Rashi switch [the verse] and first explain I cannot any longer go forth and return and afterward he explains I am today [One hundred and twenty years old] which is not in the order [written] in the verse? And another question: This another interpretation should have been said immediately, before I am today. One can answer in the manner of @ITpilpul@it: I cannot any longer go forth and return, ‘perhaps, etc.’ until ‘for Hashem has said to me, etc.’ And Rashi asks on this: If you were to ask, that the midrash says that Today my days [and years are completed], etc., which implies that if not for this reason For Hashem said to me, etc. he would not have been able to go forth and return! And he answers, Really, etc. as I explained. And what you asked, that the Midrash says Today my days [and years] were completed, etc. which implies that without this reason of For Hashem has said to me, etc. he would not have been able to go forth and return! One can answer that the Midrash explains to go forth and return in a different manner, [as Rashi himself explains in the] alternative answer: To go forth and return, “with respect to words of Torah, etc.” [in the name of @ITMaharitz@it]. According to the alternative answer one must explain For Hashem has said [to me], etc. according to its plain meaning, that Hashem said. [@ITRe”m@it]<QC>
@p1[6]@p2<TIE>He will not precipitate, in you, the feebleness [@HB<HEB>ירפך@hh@BO<ENG>], etc.@bo Rashi did not explain [the letter @ITchaf@it] is in place of you [i.e. meaning He will not weaken you] as he normally does, that its meaning is that He will not make you weak before Sichon and Og. It seems that this is because whenever a reason is given it refers to what precedes it, and it is written Do not quake before them [and the reason is] because He will not make you weak. For this reason, “Do not quake before them.” is understandable if the meaning of @ITyarpecha@it is that He will not give you weakness, to be abandoned from Him. Then it is understandable, for this reason “Do not fear,” because you are not [being] abandoned by Hashem. But if the meaning is He will not make you weak the phrase Do not quake cannot apply, because this is no reason not quake. This is also the explanation of @ITR”em@it. @p1[7]@p2<TIE>Let the elders of the generation join with you, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Later (v. 23) it is written, For @ITyou@it will bring, etc. If so, the verses apparently contradict each other! One cannot answer that You will come has the same meaning as You will bring in order that these verses do not contradict each other. This is not the case, for Unkelos translated the [verse] For you will come, etc. as Because you will go up with this people. Rashi answers and explains that here [it is] Moshe who said it to him. @d1One leader [@HB<HEB>דבר@hh@BO<ENG>] for a generation, etc.@bo The meaning of @ITdabor@it is leader.<QC>
@p1[9]@p2<TIE>When it was completely finished, etc.@bo Rashi's intention is to explain that the Torah that is mentioned here means the entire Torah from Bereishis until in view of all of Yisroel (Devarim 34:12). It is not referring to the Torah which he wrote after this, which means only @ITMishne Torah@it [Devarim]. For why would he give only @ITMishne Torah@it to the Kohanim, and not the entire Torah? @p1[10]@p2<TIE>Because there are still seventh-year restrictions which apply, etc.@bo This means if he plants in a prohibited manner during the seventh year, it remains prohibited after the seventh year as it was during the seventh year. Alternatively it refers to produce that grew by itself during the seventh year. @p1[12]@p2<TIE>To bring merit to those who brought them:@bo The verse, In order for them to hear refers back to the women. And In order for them to learn refers to the men. The children are not included in either hearing or learning, but [rather come] to bring merit to those who brought them.<QC>
@p1[14]@p2<TIE>I shall enthuse them.@bo For one cannot say it means literally a command, as there is no command written afterwards. @p1[16]@p2<TIE>The [non-Jewish] nations of the land:@bo [Rashi writes this] so that you should not explain [erroneously] that the word @ITneichar@it [foreign] refers to their gods. Rather It is as if it said the gods of the foreigners of the land. For if you say that it means foreign gods, it should have said to foreign gods. For we never find the word gods [@ITelohei@it] modified [i.e., connected] by the word which follows it. The proof-text for this is God of Avraham [@ITElohei Avraham@it], etc. (Bereishis 31:42) which means God @ITof@it Avraham, and the word god is not connected to the word which follows it. Furthermore, if the word gods' was modified by the word foreign it would not have used the phrase of the land. [I found this in the name of @ITMaharitz@it]. If you ask, what is the reason that the nations of the land are called the strangers of the land,” one can answer that they are considered foreigners in that land, because the land was not theirs, for it had already been decreed that they would be expelled from there. @p1[17]@p2<TIE>As if I do not notice their suffering.@bo This means that hiding His face is removing His Providence, for one who does not see something does not watch over it.<QC>
@p1[21]@p2<TIE>That I have warned them, in it, etc.@bo And you have no excuse to say that if we had known of all these bad punishments we would not have transgressed Hashem’s commandments. For then they will read this song which has written in it explicitly the warning that He warned them of all these bad things [if they transgress Hashem’s commandments]. @d1This is a guarantee to Yisroel, etc.@bo He means to say that our eyes see that the hearts are diminishing [from Torah knowledge], so why is it written, For it shall never be forgotten, etc.?<QC>
@p1[23]@p2<TIE>This reverts to the text above, etc.@bo That is, it refers back to above (v. 16), Hashem said to Moshe, ‘You are about to die, etc.' and after He concluded His words with Moshe, He commanded Yehoshua. But it is not connected to [v. 22] Moshe wrote, etc. for if so, that Moshe is the one commanding, it should have said That @ITHe@it swore to them and not That @ITI@it swore to them. But Rashi was unable to prove this from the words, And @ITI@it shall be with you which should have been written as And @ITHe@it shall be with you if Moshe was the one giving the commandment, because one could explain that I will be with you means my merit will be with you. Therefore Rashi was forced to prove this point from [the verse] that I swore. But were it not written, that I swore, we would have explained that [the words] For you will bring refers to Moshe, that Moshe is commanding Yehoshua. And the reason that he said above [v. 7] That you will enter, etc. is merely as advice. Therefore Rashi proves that it refers to the Divine Presence from the word That @ITI@it swore.<QC>
@p1[26]@p2<TIE>Like remember, keep, going.@bo Which are forms of the present tense, rather than an imperative. It is as if he said to them [it is your responsibility] to take this Seifer Torah and to place it at the side of the Ark, as an eternal witness. @p1[28]@p2<TIE>They did not sound the trumpets on that day, etc.@bo [Rashi] wishes to explain why it is not written, They should sound [the trumpets], as it is written in Parshas @ITBeha'aloscha@it (Bamidbar 10:2) when he gathered them.<QC>
@d1And even during his lifetime they were concealed before the day he died, etc.@bo This means that if you were to say that Yehoshua had no control over them, nevertheless he should have blown them, for Moshe was still alive! Therefore Rashi explains that even in his lifetime, etc. In other words, it is understandable if Yehoshua would have control over them after Moshe's death, they would have blown them even on the day that Moshe died. However, since Yehoshua did not have control over them after Moshe's death, it is proper that they be concealed on the day that Moshe died, and Moshe would not use his authority over them on the day of his death to fulfill the verse which states, There is no dominion on the day of death (Koheles 8:8). In other words, the authority that a person has had all his life does not remain on the day of his death. One cannot ask Why were they concealed? Even if they had not been concealed, the [people] would not have blown them. One can answer that even this would be a display of authority, that even though they were still there, Yehoshua was not permitted to use them, and therefore they were concealed. Similarly we find regarding King David of blessed memory, in every place he is mentioned he is referred to as King David. Yet on the day he died it is written, And the days of David drew near to die” (I Melochim 2:1), for this same reason, [because] there is no dominion on the day of death, etc. @p1[29]@p2<TIE>For so long as Yehoshua was alive it appeared, etc.@bo Therefore he described the death of Yehoshua as Moshe’s death, and wrote, After @ITmy@it death instead of, After the death of Yehoshua.<QC>
@p1[1]@p2<TIE>That I admonish the Israelites.@bo Rashi is answering the question: How could Moshe command the heavens? Does he rule over heaven? And a further question: Why did he take testimony against Yisroel for they had not yet sinned? Therefore he explains that “I admonish [i.e., warn] the Israelites,” as it is written above, “I invoke as witnesses (@hh<HEB>העדתי@hh@ee<ENG>) against you this day, heaven and earth” (Devarim 30:19). This is an expression of admonishing [i.e., warning], similar to, “The man warned us repeatedly (@hh<HEB>העד העיד@hh@ee<ENG>)” (Bereishis 43:3). For [Moshe] had not yet said anything to heaven or earth, and it is only now that he speaks to them. @d1So that you may serve as witnesses to the matter. For so I informed them, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Perhaps Yisroel would not accept heaven and earth as witnesses [against them]. Therefore Rashi explains, “for so I have informed them.” In other words, “I have already said to them.” @d1Similarly, “let the earth hear.”@bo This means that you should not say that since it is written, “Listen heaven @ITand@it earth as I declare,” the Torah must be speaking about two separate matters. Rather it means to say and also “let the earth hear” that I am warning Yisroel and you will be witnesses to the matter. The reason that it written regarding he heavens, “hearken” and regarding the earth, “hear” is because Moshe Rabbeinu was cleaving to the heavens, because he was nearing his death, and his soul was now cleaving to the Above. When a person is standing close to his friend, he says “hearken,” and therefore Moshe said, “Hearken [heavens].” But he was distant from the earth, therefore it is appropriate to use the term “hear.” For this reason he did not include them both in the same phrase and say, “Hearken Heaven and earth as I declare, etc.” Re”m explains that the reason he did not combine heaven and earth together is because heaven is deserving of more honor than the earth, and therefore he did not combine them in a single phrase. But his explanation does not answer why Scripture changes its expression and uses the term “hearken” for Heaven and “hear” for the earth.<QC>
@d1Moshe said, “I am only mortal and tomorrow I may die, etc.@bo If you ask: Why does Rashi in parshas @ITNitzovim@it (Devarim 30:19) offer a different reason for the verse, “I invoke, as witnesses against you this day, heaven and earth”? One can answer that above, regarding the warning, the witnesses are required to admonish the person who wants to commit the sin, in order that he will [listen to them and] not sin. If so, it is difficult [to understand], how can heaven and earth give warning? They are unable to speak! One cannot explain that Moshe warned Yisroel before heaven and earth in order that they should not sin, because at that time [when Moshe warned them] they were not intending to sin. It would have been considered a doubtful warning, which is not considered an adequate warning. Therefore Rashi explains [there] “Gaze at the heavens, etc. This type of gazing is considered as if [heaven and earth] were delivering a verbal warning. However, here in this song, [Moshe] is speaking of the punishments for Yisroel, if they transgress Hashem’s mitzvos and worship idols. And regarding punishment it is written, (Devarim 17:7) “Let the hand of the witnesses against him be first” [to punish the sinners]. Therefore [Rashi] gives a different explanation here. @p1[2]@p2<TIE>This is the witness you are to bear, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: How is this matter relevant here? And he explains that it is certainly relevant here, because this is the testimony, etc. @d1When the heavens flow with dew and rainfall.@bo One could say that [Rashi] wants to explain how this is implicit in the verse that [Moshe] said to Yisroel, that the Torah is likened to rain. And he explains that this is what the verse means: “When the heavens, etc.” And how does Rashi know to explain that “My instruction (@hh<HEB>לקחי@hh@ee<ENG>)” refers to the Torah? Because it is written, “For I have given to you a good instruction (@hh<HEB>לקח@hh@ee<ENG>)” (Mishlei 4:2). What is the reason [that @ITlekach@it refers to the Torah]? Because it is taken from hand to hand, as the verse states, “From His right [hand] — the flaming Torah” (Devarim 33:1). In other words, Moshe Rabbeinu took it from the right hand of the Holy One, Blessed Is He. And why is it called the “Living Torah”? Because the verse states, “It is a tree of life to those who grasp it” (Mishlei 3:18). @d1With which all rejoice, etc.@bo And this is not the case with rain. Afterwards [Moshe] compares [the Torah] to the wind, because this too is better than dew, and he continues and adds. @d1As in “storm winds, etc.”@bo The letters @ITsamech@it and @ITshin@it are interchangeable. @d1The envelopment of the earth, etc.@bo This means that the word grass (@hh<HEB>דשא@hh@ee<ENG>) includes many kinds of plants which clothe the earth and cover it, and the totality is called @ITdeshe@it. [The other word for] grass (@hh<HEB>עשב@hh@ee<ENG>) refers to a specific species, and each species on its own is called @ITeisev@it. See parshas @ITBereishis@it (1:11). @p1[3]@p2<TIE>Now “@HB<HEB>כי@BO<ENG>” is used to denote “when”, etc.@bo For it is impossible to explain that [@ITki@it here means “because” and that] it is giving a reason for what is written above. @d1That one responds “May the Name of His glorious kingdom be blessed, etc.”@bo If you ask that [perhaps it does not mean this formula of “Blessed, etc.” but simply] it means that they answer “Amein” [in the Beis Hamikdosh]. And furthermore from where does he know that it is referring to the Beis Hamikdosh at all, perhaps it refers to outside the Midkosh? One can answer that because it is written “Give greatness,” and “Amein” does not denote greatness, but rather is a statement of belief in the words of the one who recites the blessing. Also, it is written, “When I pronounce Hashem’s Name” which implies the Tetragrammaton [i.e., Four-letter Name of Hashem], and it is forbidden to mention this Name outside the Beis Hamikdosh. For only in the Beis Hamikdosh did they enunciate the Name as it is written.<QC>
@p1[4]@p2<TIE>Although He is almighty.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Why does Moshe Rabbeinu call the Holy One, Blessed Is He [by the Name] “Rock”? Furthermore, what is the meaning of “flawless” that is mentioned here? Are there any actions of the Holy One, Blessed Is He, that are not flawless? Therefore Rashi explains, “Although, etc.” @d1Although He delays rewarding them, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Why does Moshe use an expression of “faithfulness”? [Rashi] explains that it refers to the reward given to the righteous, which is for an endless time in the World to Come. Therefore it is appropriate to use the term “faithful.” @d1Even the wicked He rewards, etc.@bo I.e. this verse seems repetitive. Since it is written, “God of faithfulness” then certainly He does not commit injustice. [Therefore Rashi explains that the verse means] that even to the wicked [Hashem acts justly]. One might have thought that Hashem does not pay them their reward, but simply He deducts any @ITmitzvo@its from their sins, and He punishes only the remaining sins. Therefore it teaches that a sin is not offset by a corresponding mitzvah, but He pays reward for @ITmitzvos@it in this world. As Scripture writes, “And He pays His enemy to his face [to destroy him]” (Devarim 7:10), in order that he receives their full punishment for his sins in the World to Come. @d1Everyone justifies His judgment, etc.@bo I.e. [Rashi] wishes to explain the term “righteous, etc.” The term “righteous” is said in conjunction with someone who acquires perfection on his own. And Heaven forbid, this term is totally not appropriate to use concerning the Holy One, Blessed Is He (Heaven forbid). Rashi answers that [the term means that] everyone justifies His judgment.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Re”m explains that Rashi needed to explain that “everyone justifies the judgment, etc.” because it is impossible say that the verse is testifying about the righteousness of Hashem, for one would never even consider the opposite to be true. How much more so after [the verse] states pertaining to Hashem, that He is “a God of faithfulness, without injustice.” But since one could might err and say that the words “righteous” and “upright” are descriptions of the Holy One, Blessed Is He, therefore Rashi explained that both of these terms are descriptions that people ascribe to Hashem, etc. In other words, everyone accepts His judgment as being righteous. @d1And it is befitting to justify Him.@bo I.e. it is befitting for people to do so. The phrase “and upright” refers to the people. But one cannot say that “and upright” refers to the Holy One, Blessed Is He, since the word “righteous” refers to the people and not to the Holy One, Blessed Is He. Similarly the phrase, “and upright” also refers to the people, and not to the Holy One, Blessed Is He. This is simple to understand. @p1[5]@p2<TIE>They destroy themselves, not Him.@bo This means “And not Him, not the Holy One, Blessed Is He.” This is what the verse means: “They destroy.” And who have they destroyed? It continues, “not Him,” i.e. not the Holy One, Blessed Is He. Based on this [reading] the term, “Him” is connected to the word, “not” which follows it, rather than to the word “destructiveness.” Based on the words of the verse, [Onkelos] should have translated as “and to Him not.” Instead he translated it based on common usage. He had to add the word, “themselves” after the word “destructiveness” because otherwise, this the verse would not be understandable. For whom did they destroy? And the phrase “not Him” would not fit in since we do not know who they destroyed? (Re”m) @d1His erstwhile children, etc.@bo Rashi is asking: Why does He call them “His children” after they had sinned? @d1The defect was His children’s, not His defect.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Why is it written “their defect” rather than simply, “defect”? In which case the phrase, “His children” would refer back to “destructiveness” as if to say, “His children destroyed.” For this reason he translated “They destroy themselves” as if to say, “The children destroyed themselves, not He, and that is their defect,” i.e., the defect does not pertain to Him. This means the same as the phrase above, “destructiveness does not apply to Him.” The verse repeats itself using different words, as is the style in poems and prophecies. (Re”m) @d1And winds around a pendant.@bo In the same way that they make a wick for an oil lamp, where they wrap around a [strand of] straw. @p1[6]@p2<TIE>Is it before Him that you cause displeasure, etc.@bo This means that you are performing acts which are displeasing. Why is it not fitting to act in such a fashion? Because Hashem has the power to seek punishment from you. And furthermore, He has provided you with everything that is good. You should not ask from where Rashi knows that these are the two reasons that [Moshe] said to them? For you can answer, as [Moshe] continues to explain, as it is written, “A base people” who have forgotten that which was done for them, all the goodness that He did for them. And “lacking in wisdom” to understand the consequences, i.e. that He has the power to seek punishment from you, as He did to the generation of the Flood and the generation of the Dispersion [Tower of Bavel] and to the people of Sedom. From this we see that the phrase “Is it before Him [that you cause displeasure], etc.” includes both of these two reasons. @d1As He took possession of you.@bo This is a word meaning acquisition (@hh<HEB>קנין@hh@ee<ENG>).<QC>
@d1As He settled you in a nest of rock mass, etc.@bo The word @hh<HEB>קננך@hh@ee<ENG> comes from @hh<HEB>קן@hh@ee<ENG> (nest). It is written [in the Torah] as @hh<HEB>קנך@hh@ee<ENG> which denotes “acquisition,” so how does this fit in with the term “Your Father”? The expression of “acquisition” does not apply to a father [relationship]! Therefore Rashi [initially] explains that it is related to “nest.” Then Rashi’s difficulty is that if it means “nest” there should have been a @ITchirik@it under the letter @ITkoof@it, and the @ITnun@it should have a @ITdagesh@it, similar to the phrase, “Like an eagle who rouses his nest (@hh<HEB>קנו@hh@ee<ENG>) (v. 11). Therefore Rashi explains the word as meaning “perfecting” (@hh<HEB>תקון@hh@ee<ENG>). Do not ask how Rashi knows it is from the word @hh<HEB>תקון@hh@ee<ENG> (perfecting) rather than from @hh<HEB>קנין@hh@ee<ENG> (acquisition) and @hh<HEB>קן@hh@ee<ENG> (nest), because if so it should have been vocalized with a @ITcholem@it=@hh<HEB>קונך@hh@ee<ENG>, similar to the phrase “Possessor (@hh<HEB>קונה@hh@ee<ENG>) of heaven and earth” (Bereishis 14:22). And it cannot be explained only as meaning “perfecting” (@hh<HEB>תקון@hh@ee<ENG>) and “settling in a nest” (@hh<HEB>קן@hh@ee<ENG>) and not meaning “acquisition” (@hh<HEB>קננך@hh@ee<ENG>), because if so it is missing a letter @ITtav@it from @hh<HEB>תקון@hh@ee<ENG>. Perforce it is a word derived from [a combination of] all three words. @d1A nation among nations.@bo Rashi is answering the question: How is this praise, that Hashem made them? Did He not make the entire world?! Therefore Rashi explains “a nation among nations,” means that Hashem chose @ITyou@it from among all the nations of the world. @d1With every kind of basis and foundation.@bo The word @hh<HEB>כן@hh@ee<ENG> (foundation) is also a word meaning “basis,” but @hh<HEB>בסיס@hh@ee<ENG> is Aramaic and @hh<HEB>כן@hh@ee<ENG> is Hebrew. @d1Some of you are @BIkohanim@BO, some prophets, some kings, etc.@bo Which is not true with other nations, who take a king from a different land.<QC>
@p1[7]@p2<TIE>Another interpretation: You have not taken heed of the past.@bo I.e. it would have been appropriate for you to remember the days [i.e., the history of] the world. Since you did not do so, at least “study the generational epochs” in the future, etc. Rashi has to give the alternative explanation because according to the first explanation it is difficult to understand the seemingly redundant language, for it already says “Remember world history,” which includes the generation of Enosh and the generation of the Flood. Therefore Rashi gives an alternative explanation. The alternative explanation on its own is also difficult, for how does the term “study” relate to something that does not exist in this world, but only in the World to Come which “no eye has seen aside from Hashem alone” (cf. Yeshiva 64:3). Therefore Rashi also gives the first explanation. @d1This refers to the sages.@bo Because the word @hh<HEB>זקן@hh@ee<ENG> is an acronym for “one who has acquired wisdom.”<QC>
@p1[8]@p2<TIE>Their ancestral portions, He inundated and swamped them.@bo I.e. what was the portion of their inheritance? He inundated and swamped them. @d1Who were destined to issue from Shem’s posterity, etc.@bo Otherwise, why use the term “according to the number”? This is what the verse means: “When He separated the sons of man,” i.e., when He dispersed them in the generation of the Dispesion; “He established the boundaries of peoples,” which means that He did not remove them from the world. Why did He do so? “According to the number of Bnei Yisroel,” meaning for the sake of Yisroel who would [in the future] be descendants of Shem. @d1According to the number of the seventy souls of the Bnei Yisroel, etc.@bo I.e. [the verse] wants to explain one further concept. This is what the verse means: “He established boundaries of peoples,” which means that He made many nations. And how did He make them? Scripture explains, “according to the number of Bnei Yisroel” that is, He made them according to the number of seventy souls who went down to Egypt, i.e., the seventy nations. The phrase “He established the boundaries of peoples” is elucidated both with the phrase preceding and the phrase following, as I explained. Rashi needed to give two explanations because according to the first [explanation] the word “boundaries” is problematic. It should have only written, “established peoples according to the number of Bnei Yisroel.” The word “boundaries” is not needed. And according to the second explanation, since they angered Hashem, why did He not destroy them from the world? Therefore Rashi also needs the first explanation. @p1[9]@p2<TIE>Because His portion was hidden among them, etc.@bo Because the term @hh<HEB>כי@hh@ee<ENG> (because) always explains what precedes it. So here too, it implies that Scripture wants to give an explanation of what preceded. @d1He was the third patriarch, etc.@bo I.e. therefore Yaakov is called “the cable of His heritage.” @d1He and his sons were His [Hashem’s] heritage.@bo The question: Why is it also not written “Avraham or Yitzchok”? He answers that Yaakov and [all of] his sons were for Him an inheritance, but Avraham had Yishmoel who is not part of His inheritance, and Yitzchok had Eisov. Even though it has already been said above that the reason Hashem did not destroy them was because of the number of Bnei Yisroel, who are of the descendants of Shem, nevertheless it was still not explained there the connection between them and the number of Bnei Yisroel, such that He saved the generation of the Dispersion for their sake. Here it explains that the reason is “for Yaakov etc.” was hidden among them. Even though from the phrase, “Because [of] Hashem’s portion, etc.” it is not understood as “they were hidden within them.” But since it gives a reason for that which is written above, “He established the boundaries of peoples according to the number of Bnei Yisroel” which means according to the number of Bnei Yisroel who are destined to emerge from them, i.e. who were hidden within them. (Re”m)<QC>
@p1[10]@p2<TIE>He found them faithful to Hashem in, etc.@bo [By this,] Rashi means to explain why Hashem did not want Eisav and Yishmoel as His inheritance, even though they are the sons of Avraham and Yitzchok, just like the sons of Yaakov. @d1Which He arched over them like a barrel.@bo The goodness in this is in order that they should be coerced [into the covenant] and He would be unable to send them away ever, like the law of a coerced woman (Devarim 22:29). This is also how I explained in Parshas Yisro (Shemos 19:17). Do not ask how Rashi knows these three explanations [from a single verse], for one can answer, which of them could be excluded? Alternatively [one can answer that] the verse explains all three of them, for it states, “He encircled them, He granted them understanding.” He encircled them at the time of the Giving of the Torah, meaning that He arched the mountain over them like a barrel. “He encircled them,” “He sheltered them” from snakes, i.e. He surrounded them with the Clouds of Glory and killed all the snakes and scorpions. “He encircled them,” “He sheltered them like the pupil of His eye,” from the nations, i.e., He surrounded them with flags. @d1This refers to the dark area of the eye, etc.@bo Why is [this part of the eye] called @hh<HEB>אישון@hh@ee<ENG> (man-like)? Because it looks like the image of a small person. Just as the image of a person appears in a woman’s mirror. @hh<HEB>אישון@hh@ee<ENG> is a word meaning “man-like.” (Rabbeinu Bachye) @d1He encamped them [around His Presence], etc.@bo I.e. Onkelos translates the phrase “He encircled them” in this manner, and Rashi explains that it refers to the Tent of Meeting, etc. @p1[11]@p2<TIE>He directed them with compassion and sympathy, etc.@bo From here onwards [Moshe] returns to speak of the good things that He [Hashem] did for them from the time they left Egypt, and yet they had forgotten everything. @d1Between one tree and another, between one branch [@HB<HEB>שוכה@BO<ENG>] and the next.@bo The meaning of the word @hh<HEB>שוכה@hh@ee<ENG> is a branch of twigs. @d1“Shaddai — we did not find the Almighty at full power, etc.”@bo Rashi says this, and this is its meaning: The Almighty, i.e. the Holy One, Blessed Is He, we do not find Him great in power. In other words, although He is strong, He does not act with this power with His creations. @d1As it is stated, “Hashem came from Sinai, radiated forth to them from Se’ir, etc.”@bo “He came from Sinai” is not one of the four directions, rather it means that He came from Sinai towards the Jewish people. The following are the four directions: “He radiated [to them] from Se’ir, [He] appeared from Mount Paran, He came with part of the sacred myriads.” “Hashem came from Teiman” (Chavakuk 3:3). Some challenge [this explanation] because earlier Rashi explained that the verse “He radiated forth to them from Se’ir” refers to the idolaters who did not wish to accept the Torah upon themselves. And Rashi explains similarly later, in parshas Vezos Habracha (33:2). Yet here he explains the verse as referring to the world’s four directions. One can answer that the verse contains both meanings. For if the verse was written solely for the four directions, why does it use these [unusual] names for these directions? These directions are never referred to by these names anywhere else in the Torah. Perforce it refers also to the non-Jewish nations. And if Scripture comes solely to teach about the idolaters, why then does it not explicitly mention them by their names? Rather one must say that both meanings are contained within the verse. And earlier in the verse, “He found them in a wilderness country” which speaks in praise of the Jewish people, Rashi brings the reason that they elucidated [the verse] as referring to the idolaters who did not wish to accept the Torah. And on the verse, “like an eagle who rouses his nest” which speaks of the goodness that Hashem did for the Jewish people, Rashi brings the second reason.<QC>
@p1[12]@p2<TIE>He conducted them alone, in security, etc.@bo This is the meaning of the verse: And Hashem conducted Yisroel alone and in security. But it does not mean that Hashem was alone, for that is obvious. Rather the word “alone” refers back to the people, that is to say, they did not need any other nation to go along with them due to their trust [in Hashem]. Even though the word meaning “conducted them” is [written] in the future tense, it is used as past tense. @d1There was no capability among any of the, etc.@bo This is the explanation of the word “security.” In other words, they did not fear that one of the gods of the other nations would demonstrate his power to fight against them, because “there was no capability, etc.<QC>
@d1The Rabbis expound this as referring to the future, etc.@bo I.e. the verse that “Hashem [conducted them] alone, etc.” @d1Now I say that these are words of reproach, etc.@bo By this Rashi means, how can you explain the verse as referring to the future? Moshe is now speaking words of reproach with them! If so, how can it be that here in the middle of the reproach he prophesies about the future? Therefore I say, etc., in other words, even though he is speaking of the future, nevertheless they are also words of reproach on these matters, etc.  @d1Therefore, the matter must be reconciled both here and there, etc.@bo Rashi means that this is why the verse of “Hashem, conducted them alone” is both in the future tense and in the past tense.<QC>
@p1[13]@p2<TIE>The entire passage should be understood as Targum [Onkelos] translates.@bo Meaning, that Hashem will give them Eretz Yisroel. And if so you might ask, that it should have written “He will cause them to inherit, etc.” Why [write] “He shall transport them”? And Rashi goes on and explains. @d1This refers to the fruits of Eretz Yisroel, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Does Hashem not give them food to eat in other places? Therefore he explains that “this refers to the fruits, etc.” @d1There was an incident.@bo Rashi is answering the question: How could this come about, that they would suck honey from a rock? @d1Someone said to his son in Sichoni.@bo “In Sichoni” refers to the name of a place. @d1Bring me dried fig preserves from the barrel, etc.”@bo Dried figs are hard like rock, and even so there was honey on them. Therefore they would suck honey from them [like] from a rock.<QC>
@d1When non-adjunctive to the following word the vocalization is chalumish@it (“the mighty part of”), etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Why is the word @ITchalmish@it vocalized with a @ITsheva@it under the @ITlamed@it? It would ordinarily be vocalized as @ITchalumish@it with a @ITkamatz@it [under the @ITlamed@it], as in “the flint [@ITchalumish@it] into a fountain of waters” (Tehillim 114:8). Therefore he explains that “when it is not connected to the following word, etc.” But here it is connected to the word following. @d1This refers to the olives of Gush Chalav.@bo Gush Chalav is the name of a place. @p1[14]@p2<TIE>Milk of sheep. When it is used adjunctively, etc.@bo Rashi’s question: Why is it vocalized as “@ITcheleiv@it” with a @ITsheva@it under the @ITches@it and a @ITtzeirei@it under the @ITlamed@it? It should have been vocalized as @ITcholov@it with a @ITkometz@it in both places. @d1According to its plain meaning.@bo It seems that Rashi’s suggestion is as follows: The word @hh<HEB>כרים@hh@ee<ENG> means “sheep.” If so, the plain meaning of the word @hh<HEB>אילים@hh@ee<ENG> is “rams.” Without this [comment] one might have thought that the word @hh<HEB>אילים@hh@ee<ENG> means “sheep” and they are called @hh<HEB>אילים@hh@ee<ENG> because they strengthen and enrich their owners. @hh<HEB>אילים@hh@ee<ENG> is similar to in the phrase, “The mighty [@hh<HEB>אילי@hh@ee<ENG>] of the land he took” (Yechezkeil 17:13) a term that means “strong.” But now that I explained that the word @hh<HEB>כרים@hh@ee<ENG> means “sheep” we need not give a difficult explanation that [in this verse] @hh<HEB>אילים@hh@ee<ENG> means “strong,” but in fact the word @hh<HEB>אילים@hh@ee<ENG> takes its ordinary meaning. @d1Like the fat of the kidney.@bo Otherwise, why is it compared to the fat of kidneys and not any other fat? @d1You shall drink, etc.@bo I.e., the meaning of the verse is, the blood of the grapes he would drink, etc. @p1[15]@p2<TIE>There is a “light” grammatical usage, etc.@bo Rashi means that since it is from the word “covering” (@hh<HEB>כיסוי@hh@ee<ENG>) the [letter] @ITsin@it [or @ITsamech@it] should have been written with a @ITdagesh@it (punctuated dot), as we find in all places, that [the letter @ITsamech@it in the word] “@hh<HEB>כיסוי@hh@ee<ENG>” is written with a @ITdagesh@it. @d1It would have meant “You covered others, etc.”@bo But now it means that you cover yourself. @p1[16]@p2<TIE>They inflamed His fury and vengeance.@bo The word “vengeance” always means the anticipation to take revenge for something. @p1[17]@p2<TIE>Who fulfill no need, etc.@bo The word @hh<HEB>צרוך@hh@ee<ENG> means “power” or “ability.” Rashi had to explain in this manner because afterwards it is written [in the verse], “gods they did not know.” If the meaning of this verse is like the plain meaning, that they are not gods, how does Scripture refer to them afterwards as “gods”? (Re”m) @d1If they had fulfilled some need.@bo Meaning that you should not ask: Since it is written “ineffectual,” it implies that if they would have had powers, such as the stars and the constellations, they would not have provoked His jealousy. But how could it mean this? It is already written, “And lest you raise your eyes heavenward .<TIE>.<TIE>. or the moon or [the stars] — the entire host of the heavens, etc.” (Devarim 4:19). @d1The vengeance would not have been as doubly harsh as now.@bo If you ask: Rashi explain earlier, in parshas @ITKi Sissa@it (Shemos 32:11) “Why should Your anger be aroused” that a mighty person is only jealous of another mighty person, etc. and if so, why should the vengeance be doubled? The answer is that earlier it was pertaining to prayer to appease Hashem, so Moshe said, “Why should Your anger be provoked? That a mighty person, etc.” However, with regard to punishment, when Hashem comes to punish those who perform idolatry, the punishment is greater, for [worshipping] a god who has no power. @d1They did not fear them, etc.@bo The description “awed by them” would be like “My children are gone forth of me” (Yirmeyah 10:20), which means “they came out from me” or “lest you be filled with it” (Mishlei 25:16) which means “filled from it.” Similarly here, “awed by them” means in awe of them. @d1In addition, one may explain the word se’arum @it[as having the same meaning] as “demons”, etc.@bo Here too it would mean “awed by them.” But the word “by them” would mean “from the demons” which refers to the demons mentioned above. The word @hh<HEB>שערום@hh@ee<ENG> means “they made demons” just as @hh<HEB>מאלמים@hh@ee<ENG> means @hh<HEB>אלומים@hh@ee<ENG> (makes bundles)” (Bereishis 37:7). (Re”m) @p1[18]@p2<TIE>Thus weakening His capacity for benevolence towards you.@bo It comes from the same root as “His strength @hh<HEB>תשש@hh@ee<ENG> (became weak) like a female” (Rashi Bamidbar 11:15). According to the first explanation, the word @hh<HEB>תשי@hh@ee<ENG> comes from the root “I @hh<HEB>נשיתי@hh@ee<ENG> (forgot) prosperity” (Eicha 3:17). @p1[20]@p2<TIE>What will occur to them at their end.@bo What is desired is only to know what will happen to them in the end, not what will be their end, for their end will be death. Even without Hashem hiding His face, every creature must die. Rather it means what will be their punishment as a result of Hashem hiding His face. @d1They upset My good will and turn it to wrath.@bo Not that they are the ones who turn, like its plain meaning. His proof is from that which is it is written, “Because, etc. and the word “because” always explains what precedes it. This is simple to understand.<QC>
@d1My training is not noticeable in them, etc.@bo The meaning of @hh<HEB>אמן@hh@ee<ENG> (breeding) is similar to [the verse], “He @hh<HEB>אומן@hh@ee<ENG> (raised) Hadassah” (Esther 2:7). And he adds the word “noticeable” for without this addition it would mean “My training is not in them,” that “I have not trained them.” Therefore he added the word “noticeable.” @d1Another interpretation, @HB<HEB>אֵמֻן@HB@BO<ENG> denotes “faithfulness”, etc.@bo According to the first reason it is difficult to explain why it did not say @hh<HEB>אמן@hh@ee<ENG> with a @ITvav@it. Therefore Rashi gives an alternative explanation. And according to the alternative explanation it is difficult because it should have said @hh<HEB>אמון@hh@ee<ENG>.<QC>
@p1[22]@p2<TIE>Down to the foundation.@bo He added the words “you” and “your land” for without this we would not know who would be burned or which land. @d1Jerusalem, which is founded on the mountains, etc.@bo Otherwise, why is “the bases of mountains” needed? Scripture has already written that the entire land will be consumed! Rather it is referring to Jerusalem, which is founded on mountains and has its own unique importance. @p1[23]@p2<TIE>Another interpretation of @HB<HEB>אספה@hh@BO<ENG>, “I shall consume, etc.@bo In other words, I will deploy all the evils against them; no evil of the evils will be left, but all of them will be deployed against them. This is similar to “I shall deplete my arrows against them” which means that I will throw all My arrows against them. Rashi needed the alternative explanation because according to the first explanation it is difficult, for it should have written @hh<HEB>אספו@hh@ee<ENG> from the term “@hh<HEB>ספו@hh@ee<ENG> (you join) year on year” (Yeshayah 29:1), and not @hh<HEB>אספה@hh@ee<ENG> with a @IThei@it, which is from the term “@hh<HEB>תספה@hh@ee<ENG> (destroy)” (Bereishis 18:23). And according to the second explanation alone it is also difficult because it is written afterwards, “I shall deplete my arrows against them.” But the arrows have already been included in the [aforementioned] evils! Some ask that earlier in parshas @ITNitzavim@it (Devarim 29:18) Rashi explained the phrase @hh<HEB>ספות הרוה@hh@ee<ENG> “so that I shall punish him @ITadditionally@it, etc.” but here Rashi explains @hh<HEB>ספות הרוה@hh@ee<ENG> as meaning “to @ITjoin@it the sated.” One could answer that every addition means adding to something else, and therefore it joins it. Accordingly, “addition” and “join” have the same meaning and are the same concept. Earlier Rashi explained that it is a term meaning “addition” because of its context, since it is not plausible to say “I will join,” for there is no punishment for unintentional sins. So how could it say “I will join punishment to punishment”? Therefore Rashi explained it as “additionally.” But here, there is no mention of unintentional sin, but rather intentional sin, so according to its context he explains it as “joining.” It also appears to me that one could answer that the plain meaning of @hh<HEB>אספה@hh@ee<ENG> whenever it appears is “addition.” However, here one cannot explain it to mean “addition,” because that would mean that would imply that Hashem will add greater punishments than what they have sinned, but this is not so. Hashem only punishes according the wickedness the person commits before Him. Therefore Rashi was forced to explain here that it means “joined.” Therefore Rashi brought all of these verses and explained them as meaning “joined” so that at first glance you would not ask regarding his explanation, because he explains that the word “@hh<HEB>אספה@hh@ee<ENG>” as “joined/linked” in all the verses that he cites. I explained similarly above on the verse “He armed his trained servants” (Bereishis 14:14). See there. @p1[24]@p2<TIE>He would tousle his hair.@bo This is a term from the Gemara (Megilla 18a). Rashi wishes to bring proof for the explanation of R’ Moshe Hadarshan. @d1There was an incident, etc.@bo Rashi means to explain that the verse should have said, “the teeth of wild animals,” since it is wild animals that are expected to bite, not domesticated ones. @p1[25]@p2<TIE>The chambers of his heart pound with terror, etc.@bo If the verse is explained according to its plain meaning i.e., as referring to the chambers of his house, it should have said, “From his chambers there is @hh<HEB>פחד@hh@ee<ENG> (fear).” The word @hh<HEB>פחד@hh@ee<ENG> applies to something which is nearby, whereas @hh<HEB>אימה@hh@ee<ENG> (terror) applies to something that is distant; As Rashi writes in parshas @ITBeshalach@it (Shemos 15:16) on the verse, “Horror [and dread] fall upon them” (Maharan) @d1Another interpretation of “From within the chambers, terror.” Indoors will be, etc.@bo According to the first explanation it is difficult for where do we ever find in Scripture the chambers of the heart being referred to as simply “chambers”? Therefore Rashi gives: “Another interpretation, etc.” and the word @hh<HEB>חדרים@hh@ee<ENG> is [interpreted] according to its plain meaning. According to this alternative explanation it is difficult, why it says “chambers of terror”? In the city there was also plague. So it should have said “@ITindoors@it there is terror” as opposed to outdoors.” Therefore Rashi gives a third explanation; that it refers to the sins committed outside, i.e. in public, and to those sins that were committed in the innermost chambers, so that no person sees him. According to this third explanation it is difficult because if so, the verse is missing the verb, it does not mention the word any action. And if so, the letter @ITmem@it from the word “@hh<HEB>מחדרים@hh@ee<ENG> (from his chambers)” should have been [vocalized] with a @ITchirik@it [@ITmichadarim@it] which means “from the sins committed inside.” Therefore Rashi needed the alternative explanations. And according to these two [latter] explanations it is difficult, why does the verse use the word “terror,” when it should have said “from the chambers a plague.” Therefore Rashi also gave the first explanation. @p1[26]@p2<TIE>Some interpret this according to the Targum’s [Onkelos] translation, etc.@bo Meaning that some explain it according to its apparent meaning, that @hh<HEB>אפאיהם@hh@ee<ENG> is derived from the word “@hh<HEB>אף@hh@ee<ENG> (anger),” and the first @ITaleph@it represents the first person, as if it said, “I will place My anger upon them” or “against them.” But this is untenable, etc. @d1Also, the middle @BIaleph@BO is totally inappropriate.@bo In other words, this is another contradiction. @d1Onkelos’ translation follows the text of the Beraysa, etc.@bo Onkelos’ intention when he explained “I shall visit upon them.<TIE>.<TIE>. follows the text of the @ITBeraysa@it, etc.” The intent is “I shall visit My fury upon them,” that will render them non-entities, etc.” His explanation is not according to the plain meaning, as the [opinion cited above as] “Now some interpret this” understands it. @p1[27]@p2<TIE>Were it not that the enemy’s rage, etc.@bo He explains that the word @hh<HEB>לולי@hh@ee<ENG> is a combination of @ITlo@it [with a @ITvav@it] meaning “if” and @ITlo@it [with an @ITaleph@it] meaning “not.” Even though the word is written with a @ITyud@it, it is vocalized with a @ITtzeirei@it, and the @ITtzeirei@it implies an @ITaleph@it. Rashi adds the two words “against them for destruction,” because without the term “against them” we would not know on whom He is angry, and [also we would not know] the reason for the anger. @d1And if He were to overcome them and destroy them, etc.@bo Rashi adds all this because without this it is not reasonable to say that “our armed might has prevailed, etc.” For if He did not destroy them [what is the meaning] that their armed might has prevailed? @p1[28]@p2<TIE>For if they were wise, etc.@bo Rashi adds the letter @ITshin@it [meaning “because”] to the word “@hh<HEB>לו@hh@ee<ENG> (if)” because the phrase “@hh<HEB>לו@hh@ee<ENG>, etc.” is not the beginning of the phrase, but is proof for the [preceding] statement “for they are a nation who squanders counsel” because if they were wise, etc. @p1[29]@p2<TIE>At the ending punishment of Yisroel.@bo Meaning, not their own ending [but Yisroel’s]. The phrase “How can one pursue, etc.” is Rashi’s proof [to explain] that it refers to the ending punishment of Yisroel. “How could one pursue a thousand” is an explanation of the word “this” and the words “their ending” [mentioned in the preceding verse].<QC>
@p1[30]@p2<TIE>One of us [pursue] a thousand of Yisroel.@bo [It does] not [mean] one Jew chasing a thousand of them, because it is listing curses here. Some ask: It is a fact that the attribute of goodness is greater than the attribute of punishment! And with regard to the attribute of goodness it is written, “Five of you will pursue one hundred” (Vayikra 26:8). [Why then] in the attribute of punishment [it states,] that one of them will pursue a thousand of Yisroel? One can answer that the punishments listed in this song are an exception to the letter of the law of strict justice. And this is what is referred to in @ITMegillas Eicha@it “she has descended astonishingly” (Eicha 1:9), that their downfall was amazing [i.e.], not according to the general law pertaining to attributes [where the attribute of goodness is far greater than the attribute of punishment]. @p1[31]@p2<TIE>@HB<HEB>צור@BO<ENG> in Scripture always denotes a rock.@bo Rashi wants to explain also where the word @hh<HEB>סלע@hh@ee<ENG> (rock) is mentioned in Scripture. @p1[32]@p2<TIE>Galling beverages are appropriate for them, etc.@bo As if it had said, “For their grapevine is of the grapevine of Sedom,” therefore, their galling clusters are fitting for them.<QC>
@p1[33]@p2<TIE>Their cup, merciless to the bite victim, etc.@bo “@ITTheir@it cup” refers to the adders. @d1A merciless enemy shall come, etc.@bo I.e., this is the meaning of the verse, “A merciless enemy, etc.” @p1[34]@p2<TIE>The fruit of their grapevine, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: It is written, “Is @ITthis@it not, etc.” which is in the singular form, but Scripture should have written, “@ITAre@it they not, etc. [the plural form]” because it is based on the explanation of “sequestered [with Me], etc. They think that I have forgotten their @ITactions@it, etc.” Therefore Rashi explains that “it is [referring to] the fruit of their grapevine.” In other words that which is written above, “their grapevine” refers to the fruit of their grapevine. And this is what the phrase “@ITIs@it this not, etc.” is referring to. This works well, for the word “fruit” can also be singular. Therefore Scripture says @hh<HEB>הוא@hh@ee<ENG> which is masculine, and not @hh<HEB>היא@hh@ee<ENG> [which is feminine], even though @hh<HEB>תבואה@hh@ee<ENG> (grain)” is feminine, but because @hh<HEB>פרי@hh@ee<ENG> (fruit) is masculine. @p1[35]@p2<TIE>With Me, ready and available.@bo Rashi wishes to explain how the word @hh<HEB>לי@hh@ee<ENG> (to Me) can possibly apply to Hashem. “To Me” implies that it will come to Him from elsewhere, and this cannot be said about Hashem. From where could it come to Him? Everything is already in Hashem’s hand. Therefore Rashi explains that @hh<HEB>לי@hh@ee<ENG> means “With Me.” @d1The punishment by vengeance, and it shall administer [retribution] to them, etc.@bo Rashi’s intention with this is that you should not ask: Is vengeance tangible that it is written “@hh<HEB>לי נקם ושלם@hh@ee<ENG> (Literally: @ITTo@it Me is vengeance and repayment)”? By explaining “@ITWith@it Me” it implies that it is tangible! @d1Some interpret @HB<HEB>ושִׁלֵם@BO<ENG> as a noun, like @HB<HEB>ושִׁלוּם@BO<ENG> “and retribution.”@bo And it means: Mine is the vengeance and the retribution that I will avenge against them and I will punish them according to their deeds. @d1This is similar to, “The word is not theirs, etc.” W@boith this Rashi intends to bring a proof that even though it is not written with the letter @ITvav@it to make it a noun. Even so it can be explained as if it was written as a noun. @d1At the termination of the merit of the forefathers, etc.@bo This means that the phrase “at the time when they shall stumble” is speaking only of administering retribution, but not of the vengeance. For the punishments of vengeance are always ready and prepared with Him. @d1As soon as I desire to inflict, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Why is it written, “For it is close by, etc.”? But now when Moshe is rebuking them they had not yet sinned! Even [Moshe] attributes [their current status as] being dependent on the merit of the forefathers. And the merit of the forefathers was still in force. So what is the meaning of “for it is close by, etc.”? @p1[36]@p2<TIE>When He punishes them with the afflictions, etc.@bo But it cannot be explained according to its plain meaning, when He @ITjudges@it them whether for innocence or guilt. For if so, how does the next phrase, “And He will reconsider about His servants” fit in? For it implies that He will be “merciful towards his servants.” But perhaps they are found to be innocent in their judgment, and they would not require mercy! @d1The Holy One, Blessed Is He will reconsider concerning His servants, etc.@bo [Rashi] needed to reverse the order [of the words], because after the suffering comes the consolation and afterwards, “to make known that it is on His servants.” Since the verse repeated and said, “About His servants” and “His people” [alone] which precedes it did not suffice. It requires that Hashem’s Name also be repeated, as if it said, “When Hashem administers justice against His people, and Hashem will reconsider about His servants.” @d1When he sees that the power @bo[lit. hand]@BO surging, etc.@bo By this, Rashi corrects several matters. He explains “that He will see” as “when He sees” because the word @hh<HEB>כי@hh@ee<ENG> (when) here is like “When (@hh<HEB>כי@hh@ee<ENG>) you come to the land, etc.” (Vayikra 25:2) which means “when.” And the word @hh<HEB>אזלת@hh@ee<ENG> means “surging.” The word “power” refers back to the enemy, even though it is not mentioned here. He also added the word “against them” to inform who the power is going against. “None (@hh<HEB>אפס@hh@ee<ENG>)” means “no more” as in the verse, “for there is no (@hh<HEB>אפס@hh@ee<ENG>) money” (Bereishis 47:15). “Structured (@hh<HEB>עצוב@hh@ee<ENG>)” means collected under the authority of the ruler. “Fortified” (@hh<HEB>עזוב@hh@ee<ENG>) means “strengthened” and he added the term “among them” after “and that there is no one” because “no more” applies only applies to them, i.e. it is finished their being gathered and strengthened. Rashi also adds “The Holy One, Blessed Is He” after “He shall say” to inform that the one who says “Where is their god” is The Holy One, Blessed Is He. He adds “concerning them” to show the subject of “@ITtheir@it gods” refers to “about His servants” mentioned above. The conjunctive @ITvav@it of @hh<HEB>ואמר@hh@ee<ENG> “And He shall say” is like the @ITvav@it of “And the Lord your God will guard (@hh<HEB>ושמר@hh@ee<ENG>) for you” (Devarim 7:12) which means “He will guard” [in the future tense]. The meaning of the verses are as follows: When Hashem will inflict suffering on His people with all these afflictions, and He will reconsider and console them when He sees that the power of the enemy becoming greater and greater against them, and they cease to be guarded and held strongly, to be without a protector or a ruler, Hashem will say of them, “Where are your idols in whom you trusted? Let them come and save you.” Therefore it is appropriate for you to understand from all the evils that I have brought on you, and there is no savior from all the idols in whom you trusted. They have no power to stay My hand, because it is I Who has the power to lower or to raise, and “no one can rescue you from My grasp.” Afterwards Scripture mentions the vengeance which He will wreak on the enemies.<QC>
@p1[39]@p2<TIE>It is I Who humbles, etc.@bo Rashi explains the necessity of the repetition of the word “I (@hh<HEB>אני@hh@ee<ENG>).” @p1[40]@p2<TIE>For, in My fury, etc.@bo Rashi explains: It is written, “The heavens are My throne, etc.” (Yeshayah 66:1) and so if He Himself sits in heaven, so how is it feasible that He raises His hand heavenward? Therefore Rashi explains that when it is written, “heavenward” it means “to Myself” i.e. towards Myself. When [Rashi] explains, “For in My fury, etc.” he means to say that it is not general practice to swear unless one makes a promise and then he swears to verify his word. If so, why does Hashem take an oath here? He did not make a promise! For this reason Rashi explains “for in My fury, etc.” i.e. nevertheless, due to His great anger against the enemy to wreak vengeance on him, and not to reconsider this, He took an oath that He will seek vengeance from the enemy. Re”m wrote: But I do not know the meaning of the word @hh<HEB>כי@hh@ee<ENG> in the phrase “For (@hh<HEB>כי@hh@ee<ENG>) I will raise My hand heavenward.” It does not fit with any of the four possible meanings of @ITki@it, which are: “if, perhaps, rather, [and] because. It seems that this is the explanation: Since it is not general practice to swear unless he makes a promise to give or to do something for him, as we find with Boaz who said “I swear as Hashem lives, lie down, etc.” (Rus 3:13), by this he swore to keep his word, and the promises which he had promised. Something which one says that he would do, can also have the same meaning, since it is the general practice to swear [to verify] what he wants to do, so too, I will swear on account of the fury, that it is My intention to rage against the nations. “I shall lift My hand to heaven” to swear that “If I whet My saber to a gleam, etc.” Then the meaning of @hh<HEB>כי@hh@ee<ENG> here is “because” and means because “if I change.” This is similar to “Until I have spoken” (Bereishis 24:33) which is [a form of] “that.” The meaning of the verse here is as follows: Since it is general practice to take an oath on a promise that one makes to his friend, so too I will do, and I will raise My hand to Myself and say, “As I live” which is the oath. The meaning of, “heavenward” is to Himself, Who is called “Heaven’” which is His Throne.” [The verse] does not mean to say that Hashem grasped heaven in His hand and swore by holding an object [which is customary when making an oath], because the purpose in taking an object when swearing is only to add concentration and awe to the oath. This is something that does not pertain to Hashem. Do not challenge me that it says, “The hand is on Hashem’s Throne” (Shemos 17:16) where Rashi explains “the hand of Hashem is raised to swear by His throne,” because nothing is written there to imply an oath, as it does here. (Re”m) @d1This denotes an oath.@bo As if it had said, “By the life of Myself.” Not that He is informing that He is alive and eternal. @p1[41]@p2<TIE>If I whet the blade of My saber.@bo Rashi wants answer the question: How is it possible to sharpen lightning, which has no substance? Lightning is the appearance of a flash! Therefore he explains “the gleam, etc.” i.e. if I sharpen the iron of My saber. The word @hh<HEB>שינון@hh@ee<ENG> always means “sharpening” and the blade of the sabre is [made of] iron, as in “the blade of his spear” (1 Shmuel 17:7). It is called @hh<HEB>להב@hh@ee<ENG> (flash) because the sword as it flashes is similar to a flame. The word @hh<HEB>ברק@hh@ee<ENG> (lightning) is like “@hh<HEB>לברק@hh@ee<ENG> (to flash)” (Yechezkeil 21:20) which means [that He will whet it] to a gleam. @d1Discarding the attribute of compassion for My enemies.@bo I.e. and My hand will grasp the attribute of judgment, to hold on to it in order to wreak vengeance, and to discard the [attribute of] compassion, and not use it for My enemies who were destructive to you. The phrase “and hold judgment in My grasp” is connected to the phrase “My enemies who were destructive to you,” not with “discarding the attribute of compassion.” The meaning of the verse is: “I raised My hand heavenward and swore by My life, that I will sharpen My sword until it gleams like lightning, as is the custom of those who go out to war. And hold judgment in My hand, to wreak vengeance on My enemies, to avenge them for their destructiveness to you. [As the verse states,] “Where I was a little angry, and they abetted destructiveness, etc.” (Zecharyah 1:15). @d1Where I was a little angry, etc.@bo Do not ask how is it that the nations sinned in this matter, since you were delivered into their hands [by Hashem] in order that you should suffer at their hands. @d1[Another interpretation.] I hold judgment in My grasp.@bo According to the first explanation it is difficult, where is the attribute of compassion mentioned here? And according to the second explanation it is difficult because it should have written “My hand will grasp judgment.” Therefore Rashi gives the first explanation. And from my teacher, Maharal, I heard that the phrase, “another interpretation” is a copyist error, and it is all one explanation. @d1“Judgment” here denotes retribution.@bo And so the word “He grasps” is connected with “My saber to a gleam,” for lightning is Hashem’s arrow, as it states, “And His arrow will go forth like lightning” (Zecharyah 9:14) referring to retribution. But according to its plain meaning we would not learn anything. For even when a mortal king sits in judgment is able to tip the verdict to whichever side he wishes. But now that Rashi explains it to mean “retribution” we certainly learn-–that “unlike the practice of mortals, etc.” According to the @ITaggada@it, the order of the words in the verse is imprecise and it means, “And My hand grasp the lightning of My sword in judgment.” @p1[42]@p2<TIE>The enemy.@bo The word “@hh<HEB>מדם@hh@ee<ENG>” means the same as “@hh<HEB>מן דם האויב@hh@ee<ENG> (with the blood of the enemy).” The [first] letter @ITmem@it is not a [explaining the] reason, like the @ITmem@it of “@hh<HEB>מדם חלל@hh@ee<ENG> (for the blood of the slaughtered, etc.)” [in the next phrase of this verse]. The phrase “@hh<HEB>אשכיר@hh@ee<ENG> (I shall make my arrows drunk” is similar to the phrase, “@hh<HEB>שכורת@hh@ee<ENG> (drunk), but not from wine” (Yeshayah 51:21). @d1This will befall them because of their guilt over the blood of the slaughtered [Israelites], etc.@bo He explains that the first @ITmem@it of the word @hh<HEB>מדם@hh@ee<ENG> [explains] the reason. Re”m explains: This retribution that I spoke of, “I shall make My arrows drunk, etc. is because of the sin of the dead, not because of the Jews who were killed. And “from the blood of the slaughtered” means the opposite, as if it had said “from the corpses’ blood.” Because the sin which they committed was due to blood. When it writes above, “I will make My arrows drunk from their blood” it does not mean from the blood of the corpses, but it refers to the blood mentioned at the beginning of the verse. It is a metaphor. The drunkenness of His arrows is only from drinking so much blood of the enemies, as if the arrows that were shot at the enemy drinks so much of his blood that they become drunk. @d1For the iniquity of the original devastation by the enemy, etc.@bo Because it is connected with “from the blood of the slaughtered, and the captives,” which means, the sin of corpses and the sin of captives. If so, Rashi also needs to explain “for the original savagery of the enemy” as “from the sin of the head of the wildest enemy.” The word @hh<HEB>פרעות@hh@ee<ENG> means “savagery.” And because the beginning of their savagery was against Yisroel, from the time of the ancestors of these, we learn from here that “when Hashem punishes the nations he invokes against them, etc.” And because it is not clear that the beginning of the enemy’s savagery was against Yisroel, Rashi had to repeat and explain from the original devastation which they perpetrated against Yisroel. (Re”m)<QC>
@p1[43]@p2<TIE>For theft, etc.@bo Not for bloodshed, for it already stated, “He will avenge the blood of His servants.” @d1He will pacify His land and His people, etc.@bo The meaning of “His land” is “His people.”<QC>
@d1With a different viewpoint this is expounded, etc. R’ Yehuda expounds, etc.@bo This implies that there is no difference between his explanation and that of Rashi except for the verse (28) “for those nations squander counsel.” Rashi explains that the verse is referring to the idolater, and R’ Yuda explains that it is referring to Yisroel. Even though they differ on the meaning of the verse, “for the grapevine of Sedom their grapevine is” (Devarim 32:32) where Rashi explains that their behavior is like the actions of Sedom and Amorah. And Rabbi Yuda explains [the verse] as “Are you from the grapevines of Sedom, or from the plantings of Amorah? Are you not from holy plantings?” They both agree, however, that it refers to Yisroel. However, in the verse (v. 37) “where is their god?” Rashi explains that Hashem says to Yisroel, “Where is [your God]?” and Rabbi Yuda explains that this is what Yisroel is saying to the idolaters. One can explain that when Rashi writes that the words of Rabbi Yuda are exactly like his words, completely, except for (v. 28) “those nations squander counsel” only refers to the meaning of (v. 37) “He shall say.” Rashi and R’ Yuda both hold that “He shall say” are not the words of the idolaters, which is Rabbi Nechemyah’s opinion, who says that [“He shall say”] refers to the enemy, e.g. Titus and those like him. But not with regard to the verse, “Where is their god?” For if so, what does it mean that Rabbi Yuda expounds it towards Yisroel? He expounds it as referring to idolaters! But nevertheless Rashi’s and Rabbi Yuda’s explanations are not completely identical, for Rashi explains “He shall say” as referring to Yisroel. (Re”m) @p1[36]@p2<TIE>In this usage, @HB<HEB>כי@BO<ENG> is understood as, etc.@bo I.e. it gives an explanation of what precedes it. @d1Understood as “for.”@bo An explanation of [Rashi’s] explanation is that Rabbi Nechemyah explains the verse “For .<TIE>.<TIE>. will judge, etc.” as referring to when He represents them in their struggle, and the meaning of @hh<HEB>כי@hh@ee<ENG> is “for.” And the meaning of (v. 35), “Vengeance is with Me, and shall administer retribution” (v. 34) refers to the idolaters, because Hashem fights the fight of Yisroel against those who persecuted them.<QC>
@p1[39]@p2<TIE>The Holy One, may He be blessed, will then unveil His salvation, etc.@bo According to Rashi’s explanation of (v. 39) “Now observe!” means “that it is in My power to bring death or give life, unlike those idols that you worship. But according to the opinion of Rabbi Nechemyah who explains that (v. 37) “Where is their god?” refers to the enemy, who says to Yisroel, “Where is your God?, etc.” how can it say “Now observe!” such that they will understand that it is in His hand to bring death or give life? Therefore he adds that “the Holy One, Blessed Is He will then unveil His salvation” which means that then the designs of the enemy will be overturned from what they thought prior to the revelation of His salvation. @d1It is from Me that your ruin emanated.@bo Meaning, against the idolaters. @d1And from Me that your benefaction will come.@bo Meaning, to Yisroel @p1[40]@p2<TIE>Like “I have raised,” etc.@bo I.e., My hand is already raised in heaven, meaning, constantly I rest my Divine Presence etc. But it is not possible to explain that it is a phrase meaning making an “oath” because the punishments have already been written, (v. 33) “Like caustic serpents’ venom is their wine, etc.” and (v. 39) “Now observe, etc.” If so, why would He swear now? But according to the plain meaning which Rashi explained above, that it refers to Yisroel, it works well. He swears to avenge them. And similarly according to R’ Yuda. But according to the opinion of R’ Nechemyah, who explains the entire section as referring to idolaters, it is impossible to explain this as an oath. @p1[44]@p2<TIE>It was a Shabbos of shared quality (@HB<HEB>דיוזגי@BO<ENG>), etc.@bo This is [a combination of] two words and a double phrase, meaning @hh<HEB>דיו@hh@ee<ENG> (two) and @hh<HEB>זוג@hh@ee<ENG> (pair). The word @hh<HEB>זוג@hh@ee<ENG> is Aramaic and @hh<HEB>דֹיו@hh@ee<ENG> is Greek. Rashi wishes to explain with this a difficulty. Moshe spoke to the ears of the @ITpeople@it because he was still their king and prince. But why is Yehoshua involved here? He did not become their prince until @ITafter@it the death of Moshe! This is why Rashi says “It was a Shabbos of shared quality, etc.” @d1To teach that he was not conceited, etc.@bo I.e., the Torah testifies that he was not proud, and therefore he calls him Hoshei’a rather than Yehoshua. The word “@hh<HEB>זחה@hh@ee<ENG>” means “haughty” or “rude.” @p1[46]@p2<TIE>Which is comparable to a mountain balanced on a hair, etc.@bo This means that there are many things in the Torah which are as fine as a strand of hair. The word @hh<HEB>כהררין@hh@ee<ENG> (like mountains) comes from the word @hh<HEB>הר@hh@ee<ENG> (mountain) and alludes to the fact that in each of them are many things like mountains.<QC>
@p1[47]@p2<TIE>That if expounded would not yield recompense, etc.@bo Rashi needed his second explanation because according to the first explanation it is difficult, it should have only said, “Focus your thoughts .<TIE>.<TIE>. to all the statements of the Torah .<TIE>.<TIE>. for it is your life<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Why did Scripture write, “For it is not a futile thing for you, etc.”? Therefore Rashi gave his second explanation that they are two separate concepts. This is what it means: There is nothing futile in the Torah, i.e. there is nothing that is written without purpose. Furthermore, “if expounded, etc.” means that there is nothing in the Torah which if you expound it, etc. Therefore it is written, “for you,” to allude to the reward which is the essence of a person and the purpose of his success. According to the second explanation it is difficult why it is written “for it is your life”? The reason for this focus was already given. Alternatively, the [order of verses] should have been reversed, i.e., it should have written after “all the statements of this Torah,” “for it is your life” and then “for it is not a futile thing for you, etc.” Therefore Rashi also gives the first explanation. @d1From the following comment by the Rabbis: Lotan’s sister was Timna, etc.@bo I.e. from here he proves that there is nothing futile written in the Torah. But he is not bringing proof from here that it will yield recompense for expounding [theTorah]. @p1[48]@p2<TIE>In three places it is said.@bo If you ask: Why does it not count “that very day” which is stated regarding Avraham? For it is written (Bereishis 17:23), “On that very day” Avraham was circumcised, and Rashi explains, “By daytime and not by night, yet he was not afraid, etc.” One could answer that when it states regarding Avraham “on this very day” it comes to teach that he did the circumcision on the very day that he was commanded, as Rashi explains. Therefore Rashi mentions only three places.<QC>
@p1[50]@p2<TIE>With the very death you witnessed and longed for, etc.@bo Otherwise, why does it say, “Just as you brother Aharon died”? He was not the only person to ever die. @p1[51]@p2<TIE>You were the cause of unfaithfulness to Me.@bo This is the correct text: Because you were unfaithful to Me, you were the cause of their unfaithfulness to Me, etc. This is how it appears in accurate texts. It means that you caused that the people would rebel against the word of Hashem, etc., and not that Moshe and Aharon [themselves] rebelled. Rather they caused Yisroel to rebel against Hashem. @p1[52]@p2<TIE>At a distance.@bo So that you do not explain that @hh<HEB>מנגד@hh@ee<ENG> has the same meaning as in (Shemos 19:2) “opposite (@hh<HEB>נגד@hh@ee<ENG>) the mountain” which means to the east of the mountain. For if so, what difference is it to Moshe whether he sees the land from the east or from any other direction? @d1For if you will not see it now, etc.@bo Rashi explains why the phrase “but you will not come there” is necessary. Certainly if he is only permitted to see it from a distance, he certainly may not come there. Therefore he explains, “For if, etc. i.e. that it refers to what precedes it. “Go up to this Mount Ho’Avorim .<TIE>.<TIE>. and see, etc.” Why? Because “you will not come there.” And therefore if you do not see it now, when [will you see it]? If you say, I am not concerned about this, therefore he explains “And I know [that it is precious to you].”<QC>
@p1[1]@p2<TIE>Close to his death, etc.@bo Because if you do not explain that before his death means close to his death, we would not know when [Moshe spoke]. Therefore Rashi writes, For if not now when,” because it was before his death and close to his death. Alternatively, his proof is because it is written @ITbefore@it his death, as it is obvious that he did not bless them after his death. However, if the verse had not written before his death, I might have thought he blessed them a long time before his death. Therefore it is written before his death to teach us that it was close to his death (Sifri cited by @ITRe”m@it) @p1[2]@p2<TIE>He began with the praise of Hashem, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: What relationship is there between the praise of Hashem and the blessings of the tribes? Thus he explains, He began, etc. @d1[He] also mentions the merit of the Israelites, etc.@bo Otherwise, why not begin with the praise that He created the world or other praises of Hashem? @d1He went out to meet them, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Why it written @ITfrom@it Sinai? It should have said @ITto@it Sinai. Therefore, he explains, He went out to meet them, etc. The explanation being that He was already at Sinai, and when Yisroel came, He went out from Sinai to meet them as it says, And Moshe brought the people toward (@hh<HEB>לקראת@hh@ee<ENG>) [the Divine Presence of] Hashem, [leading them] out of the camp.” And the expression @hh<HEB>לקראתם@hh@ee<ENG> (to meet them) is appropriate only when one is coming to meet the other. @d1To them.@bo Rashi is explaining why the verse does not say to whom He appeared. Therefore he explains to them, i.e., to Yisroel. But regarding [He] radiated forth from Se’ir, he does not have to explain because there it is written to them (@hh<HEB>למו@it<ENG>),” referring to Yisroel mentioned above. @d1To the Israelites.@bo Rashi is answering why it does not say to whom He came? Thus he needs to explain, To the Israelites. @d1Part of the myriads of sacred angels, etc.@bo Rashi is explaining that the @hh<HEB>מם@it<ENG> of @hh<HEB>מרבבות@it<ENG> means part of and not from. His proof is that we do not find anywhere a place called @hh<HEB>רבבות@hh@ee<ENG>. Perforce the @hh<HEB>מם@it<ENG> here means part of, and this is easy to understand. @ITRe”m@it explains that if the @hh<HEB>מם@it<ENG> here means from, it would mean that Hashem left the myriads of sacred angels and came by Himself. If Rashi had not added the words with Him, the verse would be saying that part of the myriads sacred angels came, and this is not understandable [because why did they not all come], unless one adds the words with him. Rashi adds the words @hh<HEB>מלאכי@it<ENG> (angels) before the word @hh<HEB>קודש@it<ENG> (sacred), because the word sacred is [an adjective] that applies to something [a noun], such as in the verse (Shemos 22:30), @hh<HEB>אנשי קודש@it<ENG> (men of holiness). And here [the noun is] the angels. Until here are his words. @d1In black flame on white flame.@bo As people commonly write with ink on paper. The verse has to rearranged according to this explanation as if it is written, from His right [hand] to them—the flaming Torah law. And the explanation of the verse is as follows, From the writing of His right hand He gave them a law, which is the Torah that is written in black fire on white fire. (@ITRe”m@it) @d1Another interpretation, — @HB<HEB>אש דת@BO<ENG> as rendered by Targum [Onkelos], etc.@bo [Rashi gives two interpretations] because according to the first interpretation one has to rearrange the [words in the] verse; therefore he gives another interpretation, etc. But according to the other interpretation one can ask that it should have said @hh<HEB>מאש דת@it<ENG>, meaning from the fire, i.e., from white fire [as according to this interpretation there is no need to have both black and white fire]. Therefore he also needs the first interpretation.<QC>
@p1[3]@p2<TIE>He cherished the tribes, etc.@bo Rashi is explaining what the word also refers to, since the word also is inapplicable unless something similar precedes it. Therefore he explains, Also, with (this) surpassing love, etc. Meaning that it was already mentioned before His love for Yisroel and how He went from Sinai to meet them. Similarly, with this too there was surpassing love, etc. @d1They were worthy of this.@bo The explanation of @hh<HEB>תכו@it<ENG> is similar to @hh<HEB>תוך@it<ENG> (within) except it is a verb, meaning that they entered at the bottom of Mount Sinai which is compared to His feet. Rashi says They are worthy of this in order to connect the statement for they were gathered at Your feet with the statement all their sacred ones are in Your keeping. It is as if the verse said, And why did these souls merit to be secreted beneath the Throne, etc. more than other people? Because they were gathered into, etc. @d1The @HB<HEB>מ"ם@BO<ENG> here relates to the root, etc.@bo Rash is answering: Why do we need the “@hh<HEB>מם@it<ENG> if the explanation [of @hh<HEB>מדברותיך@it<ENG>] is Your Torah”? @d1Here too, “Your self-spoken” — that which You had spoken, etc.@bo You cannot say that the “@hh<HEB>מם@it<ENG> here is a prefix and means of, because if so it would imply that they did not accept the entire Torah upon themselves, when in reality they accepted all the 613 commandments. The difference between @hh<HEB>מתדבר@it<ENG> and @hh<HEB>מדבר@it<ENG> is as follows: @hh<HEB>מדבר@it<ENG> implies that Hashem is speaking directly to a person, but this is not respectful toward the Above, that He speaks directly to man, just as a person speaking to his friend. However, @hh<HEB>מתדבר@it<ENG> means to speak to oneself and someone else is listening. This is what Rashi explains, That which You had spoken, etc. The [first] @hh<HEB>יוד@it<ENG> of @hh<HEB>ישא מדברותיך@it<ENG> [converts the verb] to the future tense from the past tense [which, grammatically speaking would be correct] because at the time that Moshe blessed Yisroel, they had already received the entire Torah. Rashi says the yoke of Your Torah because the expression of burden is not applicable to speech. Therefore Rashi adds the word yoke, because the expression of burden is applicable to a yoke. @d1Another interpretation: “Even when the nations were cherished, etc.” even during the time when the Gentile nations were cherished, etc.@bo According to this interpretation, the word @hh<HEB>אף@it<ENG> [now translated as even] does not refer to what precedes it. This interpretation is more correct because the first interpretation does not explain well why it says @hh<HEB>אף חובב@hh@it<ENG> (He @ITalso@it cherished) here. According to the other interpretation you might ask that how can the Torah write an expression of cherishment regarding idolaters. Even if He shows them a beaming countenance, this is only because He wants to deliver Yisroel into their hands, but no cherishment is involved. Therefore the first interpretation is also needed.<QC>
@p1[5]@p2<TIE>The yoke of His sovereignty rests always upon them.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Is the Holy One’s sovereignty only over Yisroel? His sovereignty is over everything! Rashi therefore explains “the yoke of His sovereignty, etc.” that although He is certainly king over the nations, however they do not accept upon themselves His sovereignty like Yisroel does. The explanation [of Rashi’s statement is]: Because Yisroel is always subservient before Him to fulfill all the commandments that He decreed on them. @d1At every gathering. “Of the counting” — the counting of their gathering, etc.@bo I.e., they deserve a blessing. Rashi explains, how does the word @hh<HEB>ראש@it<ENG> relates to counting? Therefore he explains that @hh<HEB>ראשי@it<ENG> means the same as in “When you take count (@hh<HEB>ראש@it<ENG>).” The verse is saying: Whenever they gather for a counting it is in Your honor and [at such times too] they accept the yoke of Your sovereignty upon themselves.<QC>
@d1These are worthy of my blessing.@bo [Thus] this [verse] is connected to what comes afterwards, as if it said, Because of this, may Reuvein live, etc. [According to this interpretation], There was a king in Yeshurun is connected to what precedes it, The Torah which Moshe commanded us, etc. [As Rashi writes], We have embraced it, and we shall not forsake it, etc.,” and the Holy One, the yoke of His sovereignty rests always upon them. @d1Another interpretation: “When they gathered, etc.”@bo [According to this interpretation], the statement There was a king in Yeshurun is connected with at the gathering, etc., [and is not a continuation of the previous verse]. And this is more correct. But according to the alternative interpretation you might ask why the verse mentions the word @hh<HEB>ראשי@it<ENG> [now translated as heads]. Therefore he also gives the first interpretation. @p1[6]@p2<TIE>In this world.@bo Meaning, that he should not die from a death incurred by excision. @d1In the World to Come.@bo Meaning, that the righteous even in their death are called living.<QC>
@p1[7]@p2<TIE>No stranger passed between them, etc.@bo Meaning, that no stranger could compare to them. Alternatively, he juxtaposed the blessing of Yehudah to [the blessing of] Reuvein, and he did not bless Levi after blessing Reuvein. @d1Moshe said, “Who was responsible for Reuvein’s confession? Yehudah, etc.”@bo According to this, Now this for Yehudah is an expression of surprise. [I.e., does Yehudah deserve that his bones roll in the coffin?!]. When Rashi explains, Who was responsible for Reuvein’s confession? he means, Who was responsible for Reuvein’s public confession? because Reuvein had confessed in private beforehand, as Rashi explained earlier in @ITparshas@it Vayeishev (Bereishis 37:29), that [Reuvein] was occupied with his sack-cloth, etc., which was before the incident of Tamar and Yehudah. This indicates that Reuvein had already confessed. Perforce we must say that he was occupied with his sack-cloth, etc. in private. But after Yehudah had confessed, he was occupied with his sack-cloth even in public. So too answer Tosefos in Perek Hachovel (Bava Kamma 92a). @d1Another interpretation [of] “Hashem, hear the voice of Yehudah, etc.”@bo [Rashi gives two interpretations] because according to the first interpretation, you might ask that it should have said Hashem, @ITaccept@it the voice of Yehudah, because if He [just] heard him but did not accept his prayer, what benefit would there be in listening? Therefore, he gives another interpretation so that the word @hh<HEB>שמע@it<ENG> (listen) hints at Shimon’s name. And according to the alternative interpretation you might ask why Moshe hinted at Shimon’s blessing [specifically] in Yehudah’s blessing? And why did Shimon take a portion [specifically] within Yehudah’s inheritance? Therefore he also gives the first interpretation. @p1[8]@p2<TIE>Regarding Levi he said.@bo Because the verse says [afterwards] Your @ITtumim@it and Your @ITurim@it which is certainly addressed to the Shechinah, as Rashi explains. Therefore perforce Moshe was speaking not @ITto@it Levi, but @ITregarding@it Levi. @d1As Targum [Onkelos] renders.@bo “You tested him at the waters of strife, and found him faithful.” Meaning, that through the quarrels at the waters of strife, you tested his heart and found him faithful. (Re”m) @d1You set a libel upon him to come with a spurious charge, etc.@bo When Rashi writes to come with a spurious charge, this is the explanation of @hh<HEB>נסתקפת@it<ENG>, You set a libel upon him. It [@hh<HEB>נסתקפת@it<ENG>] is an expression of libel as Rashi explained above in @ITparshas@it Mikeitz (Bereishis 43:18), on the verse That he may turn on us. See there. @d1If Moshe exclaimed, “Now listen, rebels.”@bo And on account of this, death was decreed on him and that he could not enter the land. This [interpretation] too is praise of the tribe of Levi. Rashi needs the other interpretation because according to the first interpretation you might ask that Moshe was not found faithful as he erred due to anger, and he was angry when he should not have been. Therefore he gives “another interpretation, etc.” And according to the other interpretation you might ask, were Aharon and Miriam equal to the entire tribe of Levi that the verse should say of them You brought him to strife, etc., which the verse implies as referring to the whole tribe of Levi. Therefore he gives the first interpretation where the whole tribe of Levi was faithful except for Moshe who sinned.<QC>
@p1[9]@p2<TIE>You must not have other Gods.@bo Meaning that which You told them Yourself, because they heard I am Hashem, your God, and You must not have any other gods from Hashem’s mouth. [Rashi says this] because otherwise the verse should have said They observed your @ITTorah@it. @d1For, of those born in the wilderness, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: It is written (Yechezkel 16:6), And I saw you wallowing in your bloods, and the sages expound, Two bloods, the blood of Pesach [offering] and the blood of circumcision, which indicates that all of Yisroel were circumcised in Egypt and in the wilderness. If so, what is the meaning of [The @ITLevi’im@it] kept your covenant? Rashi therefore explains that it is referring to those born in the wilderness. (@ITRe”m@it). But regarding those who went out of Egypt, they were all circumcised. This is an explicit verse (Yehoshua 5:5), For all those who went out were circumcised, but all those who were born in the wilderness, on the road when they went out of Egypt, they did not circumcise. Therefore Rashi [specifically] mentions the wilderness. @p1[10]@p2<TIE>They are worthy of this.@bo Rashi is answering the question: When he is blessing the tribe of Levi here as [he blesses] the other tribes, why does he praise of the tribe of Levi before [bestowing] the blessing, more so than [he does with regards to] the blessings of the other tribes. Therefore he explains, They are worthy of this, etc., meaning that if he did not relate their praise beforehand, Yisroel would quarrel with Moshe for giving them the blessing, They shall teach your law, etc., since this was the best of all the blessings. They would say that Moshe gave them a good blessing because they were of his tribe. Therefore he related their praise beforehand, and afterwards he said, They are worthy of this blessing because of their great importance. @d1The @BIolah.@bo It is called by this name because it entirely consumed [on the altar] for the Above.<QC>
@p1[11]@p2<TIE>He foresaw that Chashmonai and his sons, etc.@bo Because according to the first interpretation one might ask, why did he give the tribe of Levi this blessing? They did not go out to war like the other tribes, but sat in the sanctuary of the King. Therefore he gives “Another interpretation, etc.” And according to the second interpretation you might ask why Scripture says @IThis@it adversaries, for they [i.e. the Greeks] were the enemies of all Yisroel because the purpose of their decrees was to make them transgress the commandments. Therefore Rashi also gives the first interpretation. @d1Shatter his adversaries and enemies.@bo I.e., shatter also refers to his adversaries, otherwise, how is [the phrase] his adversaries connected to above? @p1[12]@p2<TIE>Because Levi’s blessing was concerned with the sacrificial services, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question that if he was the youngest, why is his blessing given precedence?<QC>
@d1And because the Eternal Sanctuary is more cherished than Shiloh, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: The verse should at least have given precedence to Yoseif because he too had the tabernacle of Shiloh in his territory! Therefore he explains, Because, etc. @d1Eternally — once Jerusalem was chosen, etc.@bo [Rashi says this] to exclude that you do not explain this as referring to the World to Come. Rashi is answering the question: Jerusalem is destroyed, so how can it be forever?! He answers, Once Jerusalem was chosen, etc. meaning that the sanctity was [indeed only] temporary, and [will return only to Jerusalem] in the future. Also, the @ITShechinah@it did not rest elsewhere afterwards. This is not the case regarding Gilgal, Nov and Shiloh. @d1At the pinnacle of his territory, etc.@bo This is the meaning of shoulders, which are the highest of all the limbs. You might ask that if so, he should have built it at the top of the mountain which is even higher? Therefore Rashi explains, Except that it was, etc. below, etc. I.e., the place where the Beis Hamikdosh stood was twenty-three @ITamos@it below Eitam spring. Therefore it is written between his shoulders and not on his head. You might ask how Rashi knows this. Therefore Rashi explains, It was there that David had intended to construct it. And why did he not do so? [But] they remarked, etc. This indicates that the Holy One did not want it built at the highest point of His land. Rashi [then] writes, why did He not want to build it at the highest point of His land but only between his shoulders? Because Nothing is pleasing, etc. (I found this in the name of Maharitz)  @p1[13]@p2<TIE>For none of the tribal territories, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Are the territories of the other tribes not blessed? Therefore he explains, For none, etc. I.e., the other territories were also blessed, but the territory of Yoseif was [blessed] more than all of them. @d1As the waters of the deep rise.@bo Meaning, they rise from below. @d1You find that, with all the tribes, etc.@bo Rashi wants to prove how he knows that his explanation of and the depth that lie below is correct? Perhaps it is speaking of something else that lies [in] the depth [and not the waters of the depth]? Therefore he explains, You find, etc. And there with Yaakov it is written (Bereishis 49:25), The blessings of heaven from above, blessings of the depths that lie below. And there its meaning is certainly that the depth itself rises up from below, similar to the dew that comes from above, and if so, here too it is so.<QC>
@p1[14]@p2<TIE>Another interpretation. “The monthly yield.”@bo Rashi is answering the question: It should have said @hh<HEB>גרש ירח@it<ENG> (moon’s ripening) in the singular form. Why does it say @hh<HEB>ירחים@it<ENG> (moons’)? He [therefore] explains, Which the earth sheds, etc. i.e., each month produces once again and therefore it is written moons’ in the plural form. @p1[15]@p2<TIE>Blessed, also, with the first-ripening fruits, etc.@bo Rashi adds the word blessed to indicate that the phrase with the first, etc. is connected with blessed at the beginning of the verses. You might ask what prompted Rashi here to explain that the phrase with the first is connected with blessed at the beginning of the verses, more than the verse With the delight of the sun’s harvest, etc. which is also connected to the beginning of the verses? The answer is that if Rashi did not explain this I might have thought that this verse, With the first of the early mountains, etc. is a separate matter, and means that he should be blessed with the blessing of the Patriarchs who are called mountains and with the blessing of the Matriarchs who are called hills. Therefore he explains that with the first of the early mountains refers to the beginning of the verses that deals with the blessing of his Land. His proof that it refers to the beginning of the verses is because it is written afterwards, And from the sweetness of earth and its fullness, etc. that deals with the blessing of his Land; [this indicates that] all the verses are connected to the beginning of the verses. @d1Another interpretation: This teaches that their creation preceded that of the other mountains.@bo The importance and praise of this is that the Holy One’s supervision over His Land is more than that over the other lands. Since it had precedence at Creation, the Holy One’s supervision also has precedence there. Rashi gives another interpretation because according to the first interpretation you might ask why the verse writes early, being that everything is already included in the word first. Therefore he gives another interpretation. And according to the other interpretation on its own you might ask why this is a blessing. Even though it indicates the land’s importance and praise, as we explained, it is nevertheless not a blessing. Therefore he needs the first interpretation. @d1Hills which are always productive, etc.@bo Meaning, they never fail from producing fruit, even with a lack of rain. It is as if the verse said, With the sweetness of the hills that is constant without pause,” otherwise, what is the relevance of hills to this verse? @p1[16]@p2<TIE>This blessing on Yoseif’s head.@bo Rashi adds the word blessing because without it, the verse does not indicate what will be visited upon Yoseif’s head. Therefore Rashi adds this blessing. @p1[17]@p2<TIE>@HB<HEB>בכור@BO<ENG> sometimes denotes grandeur and regency, etc.@bo So here too @hh<HEB>בכור@it<ENG> means grandeur; and it means The king descended from him. @d1Who was as supremely powerful as the ox, etc.@bo Rashi is explaining why the comparison to an ox. @d1The ox is supremely powerful, but his horns are unattractive, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Why the verse does not also compare Yoseif to an ox regarding his horns? Why does it compare him regarding his horns to a @ITre’em@it? This explains why the Rabbis explain, as cited by Rashi in @ITparshas@it Balak (Bamidbar 23:22), that @ITre’em@it [there] means loftiness or demons and not an actual @ITre’em,@it because there it is describing the power and might of the Holy One, and the @ITre’em@it is extremely weak. @d1Is it possible that all of them were natives of Eretz Yisroel, etc.?@bo This is a question of wonder. Since the land of Yisroel was only four hundred @ITparsah@it by four hundred @ITparsah,@it how then is it possible for thirty-one kings rule in the Land of Yisroel?!<QC>
@d1The territory coveted (@HB<HEB>צבי@BO<ENG>) by hordes of nations.@bo And this is similar to the expression @hh<HEB>בצביונם@BO@bo<ENG> (the form @ITchosen@it for them) (Chullin 60a). @p1[18]@p2<TIE>With the following five tribes whom he blessed last, etc.@bo Rashi is explaining why Zevulun’s name is repeated, unlike any other tribe previously mentioned. @d1Zevulun and Yissachar entered into a partnership, etc.@bo Rashi is explaining why Zevulun appears in the text before [the older] Yissachar.<QC>
@p1[19]@p2<TIE>They shall assemble at Mount Moriah, etc.@bo Meaning, at the pilgrimage festivals. You might ask: If so it should have said assemble and not invited. Therefore Rashi explains, Every assembly is through invitation, etc. Therefore, even though [the assembly] here is not by invitation, rather they came on their own, the verse still writes an expression of “invitation.” @ITRe”m@it writes, My heart is dissatisfied with this [explanation] because @hh<HEB>יקראו@it<ENG> should have been written with a @ITkamatz@it under the @hh<HEB>קוף@it<ENG> and the @hh<HEB>ריש@it<ENG> with a @ITtzeirei@it to make it reflexive. [Whereas according to the punctuation of our verse, @hh<HEB>יקראו@it<ENG> means ‘they assemble them,’ wrongly implying that Yisachar and Zevulun assemble the people]. It seems to me that @hh<HEB>אסיפה@it<ENG> here means inviting as we explained, and [the active conjugation means not that Yisachar and Zevulun assemble them, but that] they assemble on their own to fulfill Hashem’s commandment to come up on pilgrimage festivals. And because other assemblies are by invitation, Scripture here writes @hh<HEB>יקראו@it<ENG> instead of @hh<HEB>יתאספו@it<ENG>. And it is not reflexive and therefore it is not punctuated with reflexive punctuation. (So it seems to me). @ITRe”m@it further writes, However, I do not know what relevance there is to mentioning the assembling of the tribes at Mount Moriah within the blessing of Yisachar and Zevulun?” In truth, I do not know why he does not know, because [apparently] Rashi himself was aware of this question and he writes, Based on their arrangement of the time [divisions] and of the leap year—‘Peoples,’ of the tribes of Yisroel, — ‘Shall assemble at the mountain,’ Mount Moriah, etc. Perhaps @ITRe”m@it wrote what he wrote because he had a [different] erroneous text. This is easy to understand. (So it seems to me). @d1And there slaughter, during the festivals, righteous offerings.@bo Rashi wants to show the connection between the verses. Therefore he adds a @ITvav@it [and] to indicate that they will [all] slaughter righteous offerings on the festivals, even though they bring offerings there every day of the year. Therefore Rashi adds and in order to connect the phrases of the verse together. @d1Affording them the opportunity, etc.@bo Rashi explains, what blessing is there in this [unless they can study Torah]? @d1@HB<HEB>טרית@BO<ENG> (tuna).@bo @hh<HEB>טרית@it<ENG> is a kind of fish named @ITtunina@it. @d1Zevulun, a people disdainful of their souls in seeking death, etc.@bo It is talking about Zevulun there, who wished death for himself because Naftoli was on the loftiest ground. The Gemara asks on this [verse]: A people disdainful of their souls, that just because Naftoli was on the loftiest ground he should seek death for himself? The Gemara answers, Zevulun lamented, etc. and to me you only gave seas. The Holy One, Blessed Is He answered him, To you I gave the sea from where you can take tuna, etc. @d1Translated by Targum as “lined with a cedar covering.”@bo Meaning that it covers the beams with cedar.<QC>
@d1Another interpretation. “Gentile nations shall assemble at the mountain, etc.”@bo Because according to the first interpretation you might ask why it says @ITThere@it will they slaughter righteous offerings, are not @ITall@it offerings slaughtered there? Also, what is [the meaning of] @ITrighteous@it offerings? Are not all offerings [wherever they are permitted] righteous offerings? Therefore he gives another interpretation, etc. And according to the other interpretation too, you might ask that it should have said explicitly [that they at least retract from idolatry], because before bringing offerings they need conversion, [retraction] from their idolatry! Therefore he also needs the first interpretation. @p1[20]@p2<TIE>The breadth of Gad’s border ranged eastward.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Gad’s [western] border reached no further than the Jordan, if so what is the meaning, Blessed is the One who broadens Gad? Therefore Rashi explains that it broadened eastward and not westward. @d1Because he was near the border, etc.@bo @ITRe”m@it writes, I do not understand Rashi’s intent here. How does Rashi know that Gad is compared to a lion because he was close to the border? Perhaps he is compared to a lion because he was strong as a lion? The answer may be that only Gad is compared to a lion [here], but not Yehudah who is compared to a lion in Yaakov’s blessing. Therefore he has to explain, ‘For all those near the border must be supremely powerful.’ It seems to me that Rashi says this because shortly before he said that their names were repeated to strengthen and empower them because they were weak. In accordance to that he explains here Because he was close to the border, etc., since one cannot say the reason [he is compared to a lion] is that he was strong as a lion as he was one of the weak [tribes]. @p1[21]@p2<TIE>In the territory of Sichon and Og, which was foremost in the conquest, etc.@bo Rashi adds the word conquest so that@hh<HEB> ראשית @it<ENG>(foremost) [which serves as an adjective] is connected with the word after it, because there is no case where @hh<HEB>ראשית@it<ENG> is not connected with the word after it. Rashi explains so explicitly at the beginning of @ITparshas@it Bereishis (1:1). @d1For he knew that there, in his territory, was the plot [of the great scribe’s burial ground].@bo Rashi has to say this because the plain meaning of the verse implies that the great scribe’s is already buried there, and this is not so since Moshe was still alive at that time. Therefore he explains that he knew through tradition or prophecy. By adding the word burial Rashi also rectifies [a misunderstanding], as the verse implies that the great scribe had a portion in the land as it says, @hh<HEB>חלקת מחוקק ספון@it<ENG> (lit. the great scribe’s plot), whereas Moshe did not have a portion or inheritance in the land. Therefore he explains, The plot of the great scribe’s burial ground. He adds the word field because @hh<HEB>חלקת@it<ENG> (plot, but lit. portion) implies a portion of something and one needs to know of what is it a portion. Therefore Rashi adds the word field as in the verse (Ruth 4:3), The portion of the field that belonged to our brother. @d1That plot is concealed, hidden, etc.@bo Rashi says this so that one should not say that the great scribe is hidden, but rather the place of his burial, i.e., the plot he is buried in, as it is written (below 34:6), No man knows his burial place. There are those who question, how is it possible to say that Moshe’s burial place is in Gad’s inheritance? Was not his burial at Mount Nevo, as it is written below (34:1), Moshe went up from the plains of Moav to Mount Nevo etc. and Mount Nevo was in the inheritance of Reuvein as it is written in @ITparshas@it Matos (Bamidbar 32:37-38), The tribe of Reuvein built up Cheshbon, etc. [and] Nevo, etc. It seems to me that the plain of Nevo was large and the town was established in the plain, while the mountain was in the portion of Gad. And because the mountain and town originally belonged to one person, the mountain was called by the town’s name. Also, it was not all that far from the town and it was situated in the plain of the town. Therefore the mountain was named after the town. @d1Another interpretation: “He came” — Moshe, etc.@bo Because according to the first interpretation you might ask why it says [specifically] of Gad that he came at the head of the people, since Reuvein and the half tribe of Menashe also went before their brothers. Therefore he gives another interpretation. And according to the alternative interpretation you might ask why it mentions Moshe’s righteousness in the blessing of Gad. Therefore he gives the first interpretation.<QC>
@p1[22]@p2<TIE>The Yardein originated from his portion.@bo I.e., from the portion of Don. @d1From the cavern of Pamias, etc.@bo “The cavern of Pamias” is the Talmud’s term. Scripture calls it Leshem. @d1As it is said, “They called Leshem ‘Don.’”@bo I.e., because it was his portion. @d1It bounds forth, flowing from Bashan.@bo Meaning that the river that it is in the portion of Gad and goes past Pamias, [actually] comes forth from Bashan, which is the name of a location, and it is not in Don’s territory. @d1Another interpretation: Just as the bounding flow emanates from a single source, etc.@bo Because according to the first interpretation you might ask that according to its plain meaning, the verse is speaking of the actual tribe of Don and not about the Jordan, since the verse makes no mention about the Jordan. Therefore he gives another interpretation, etc. And according to the other interpretation by itself you might also ask why it says bounding from the Bashan since he did not take a portion in Bashan? Therefore he also gives the first interpretation. @p1[23]@p2<TIE>He also took a measure of fully spread fishnet rope, etc.@bo Meaning, he took a measure of fully rope to spread nets and traps. @hh<HEB>חרמים@it<ENG> has the same meaning as @hh<HEB>מכמורות@it<ENG> and is a repetition.<QC>
@p1[24]@p2<TIE>He found favor with his brothers with oil, etc.@bo It was taught in a Beraisa: R’ Yehudah says, “@hh<HEB>אנפיקינון@hh@ee<ENG> is oil of olives that had not reached a third [of their size]. And why do they anoint with it? Because it removes the hair and beautifies the skin (Pesachim 43a). @d1Another interpretation: “He shall be favored by his brothers,” since his daughters were beautiful, etc.@bo Because according to the first interpretation you might ask why he was more favored to his brothers than his brothers were to him, since they found favor with him through produce [they supplied him with]. And according to the other interpretation you might ask that the verse should say, May Asher be blessed with daughters since his daughters were beautiful, or at least include the daughters with the sons and write, May Asher be blessed with sons and daughters. Therefore he also gives the first interpretation. @d1“He was the father of Birzayis,”as his daughters were married, etc.@bo You might ask that if so it should have said [his name was] @ITBaszayis@it (daughter of olive)? The answer is that the children of his daughters were like his own children, because grandchildren are [considered] as one’s own children, and regarding them it says Birzayis (son of olive). (In the name of the Maharitz) @d1They appointed an emissary.@bo Meaning an emissary, and he went and found much oil in his land. @p1[25]@p2<TIE>Another interpretation: Your locks are iron and copper, etc.@bo Because according to the first interpretation you might ask what is the relevance of copper to locks, since people generally make locks only from iron. Also, the verse does not mention bolts. Therefore he gives another interpretation. And according to the other interpretation you might ask why it says this specifically about Asher, since other tribes also settled at the border and mountains surrounded their territory. Therefore the first interpretation is also needed. This is easy to understand. @d1Asher locked-in Eretz Yisroel.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Why this is mentioned in the blessing of Asher more so than [in the blessings of] the other tribes, since it is a blessing that could [otherwise] apply to all the tribes? @d1Which [generally] flow downward, droop, and decline.@bo Rashi is answering how days of old age are connected to [the word] @hh<HEB>דבאך@it<ENG>. @d1Another interpretation: According to your days, shall be your stream, etc.@bo Because according to the first interpretation you might ask that it should have said, As your youth so may be your declining days. Therefore Rashi gives another interpretation. And according to the alternative interpretation alone you might ask that it should have said According to your deeds, shall be your stream. Therefore he also needs the first interpretation. @d1Which are beneficial to you — according to the number of your days, etc.@bo Meaning, all the time that your days are called days, i.e., all the days you do Hashem’s will, so shall be your stream as all the countries shall stream, etc. But when you do not do Hashem’s will, your days are not called days, as the sages say (Berachos 18b), The wicked are called dead even during their lifetime. @p1[26]@p2<TIE>That none is comparable to Hashem, among all the Gentile deities and not like your Mighty Rock is their rock. @boWhy does Rashi cite the words and not, etc. [seemingly] for no reason? One might say that he is answering the question: Why the verse does not say, @hh<HEB>אין כאלהי ישורון@it<ENG> (there is none like the God of Yeshurun) as it says (Psalms 96:5), “@hh<HEB>כל אלהי העמים אלילים@it<ENG> (for all the gods of the nations are things of nothingness).” Why does the verse say @hh<HEB>אין כאל@it<ENG>? Regarding this he explains [that the verse means], For not like your [Mighty] Rock is their rock. And @hh<HEB>אל@it<ENG> too is an expression of might as it says (Yechezkel 17:13), And he took away the mighty (@hh<HEB>אילי@it<ENG>) of the land. Therefore it also says @hh<HEB>אין כאל@it<ENG>, which is an expression of might. @d1He is the God, etc.@bo The letter @hh<HEB>שין@it<ENG> [i.e., the word Who] is missing as [it is missing] in (Shemos 18:20) @hh<HEB>את הדרך ילכו בה@it<ENG>, The path [that] they must walk in. Because without this [Rashi’s interpretation] there would be no way to understand and, in His pride, the high heavens, which means, and in His pride He straddles the high heavens, since straddles at the beginning of the verse also refers to the high heavens at the end of the verse. @p1[27]@p2<TIE>The heavens are as the dwelling, etc.@bo Since this verse is connected to the previous verse and means, In His pride He straddles the high heavens which are the dwelling of the eternal God. He is called the earliest God here to explain why he chose the high heavens as His dwelling place; because He preceded all the gods. @d1Below His dwelling, [all the strong-armed reside].@bo Meaning that beneath Him all the strong-armed reside, such as Sichon and Og, etc. The verse says that they are beneath in order to describe their weakness. Even though they are the powerful ones of long ago, but because they dwell below, they quake before Him, because the exalted are always fearsome, etc. And because the Mighty One is your aid, He will banish all your enemies from your presence and say to you, Destroy them. (@ITRe”m@it) @d1And said to you, “Destroy!” them.@bo Rashi adds the word to you after said to inform to whom this statement is said. He also adds the word them after the word destroy, to inform us that the word destroy refers to the enemy mentioned above, and it is as if it said, And said to you, ‘Destroy the enemy.’ @p1[28]@p2<TIE>Each and every individual, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Why do we need the word @hh<HEB>בדד@it<ENG>, once it says @hh<HEB>בטח@it<ENG>, securely? For Rashi explained above in @ITparshas@it Ha’azinu (32:12) [on the verse, @hh<HEB>ה' בדד ינחנו@hh@it<ENG>], Hashem conducted them alone, in security. Thus @hh<HEB>בדד@it<ENG> also connotes security. He answers that here @hh<HEB>בדד@it<ENG> means each and every individual etc. @d1As in, “Its likeness was similar to crystal, etc.”@bo Whose meaning is, in the likeness of crystal and its appearance. Here too it means, in the likeness of Yaakov’s blessing. @d1Not like the isolation Yirmiyahu mentioned.@bo Rashi is explaining why the verse needs to say that the blessing is in the likeness the blessing of Yaakov, which implies not in the likeness of another blessing. [Which is the other blessing?] He therefore explains, not in the likeness of the blessing of Yirmiyahu, etc. @d1Also, Yitzchak’s blessing, etc.@bo Meaning, not only Yaakov’s blessing will be fulfilled regarding you, but also Yitzchak’s blessing. I.e., this blessing is like the blessing of Yaakov [that he gave to his sons], and also like the blessing of Yitzchak where it says (Bereishis 27:28), And may G-d give you of the @ITdew@it of heaven. Therefore Yitzchak’s blessing is alluded to in the words shall drip @ITdew@it. @p1[29]@p2<TIE>Your salvation is in Hashem, etc.@bo Rashi says your salvation instead of a people saved, because the verse should have said a people saved @ITby@it Hashem. Therefore he emended this by writing your salvation is @ITin@it Hashem, meaning that your salvation is dependent upon Him. However, the explanation your salvation would be unconnected to anything preceding it or following it, therefore he adds the word who. @p1[1]@p2<TIE>There were a number of elevations, etc.@bo Otherwise, the verse should only have said Moshe went up to Mount Nevo. Why does it say from the plains of Moav”? Do we not know already that Moshe was in the plains of Moav since the whole of Devarim was taught in the plains of Moav? @d1He showed him all of Eretz Yisroel in its tranquility, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: The verse should only have said the entire land until the rearward sea. Why do I need all these details, the Gilod, etc.? And because of this reason he [also] has to explain [what is hinted in] the Negev and the plain, etc.<QC>
@p1[4]@p2<TIE>So that you may go forth and say to Avraham, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Why the verse says saying? It is so that you may go forth and say, etc. According to this, it seems to me that the phrases in the verse should be rearranged and the phrase I have shown it to you should appear earlier. It is as if Hashem said, “This is the land that I swore, etc., I have shown it to you with your eyes to say, ‘I will give it to your descendants.’<QC>
@d1However, it has been decreed before Me.@bo Rashi is answering the question: If so, why did He not take him over so he would be able to see more and tell them? Therefore Rashi says However, etc. @d1Were it not for this, I would have sustained you, etc.@bo Meaning, were it not for the oath [that Moshe would not enter]. Even though it is written (above 31:2), I am 120 years old today, [and Rashi explains], Today my days and years are completed, so that even were it not for the oath he would die since his days were completed, nevertheless, I would have sustained you [even longer]. (In the name of the Maharitz). It seems to me that when Rashi explains, Today my days and years are completed, etc. he means, when saying his days were completed, that on this day I was born and on this day I will die. But regarding his years [i.e., age], because of his merit, if not for the sin he would have lived long [even more than 120 years] as his father lived long, and he would have merited to enter the land. But because of the sin he did not live [so] long and his years were completed now. You cannot say that this is [considered] shortened years [and cannot be called completed years], since the span of our years is [normally] seventy years, and when one lives longer, it is because of his merit. According to what I wrote in the name of Maharitz this question is also answered [since he explains that Moshe did reach his allotted time span].<QC>
@p1[5]@p2<TIE>While Moshe wrote with teardrops.@bo Some explain, with teardrops and not with ink, in order to differentiate between these eight verses and the entire Torah, so that one person should read them [during the Torah reading] and not two; and without any interruption. And some explain that he shed tears as he was writing. @p1[6]@p2<TIE>The Holy One, Blessed is He, in His glory.@bo They expound this since the two are juxtaposed to each other. By the mouth of Hashem [followed by] He buried him.<QC>
@p1[7]@p2<TIE>His moistness. He was not subject to decay, etc.@bo This is the meaning of his freshness did not fade. His countenance was not disfigured is the meaning of his appearance was not dulled, meaning that his appearance did not alter even after he died. Because otherwise Scripture should have written, And Moshe was 120, etc. at his death in the plains of Moav, his appearance was not dulled, etc., as it is written above regarding Aharon (Bamidbar 33:39), Aharon was 123 years old at his death on Hor Hohor. Thus [we infer] that the reason it does not say in the plains of Moav here is in order to juxtapose at his death to his appearance was not dulled, to teach that even in his death his appearance was not dulled, etc. Analyze this. (So it seems to me). @ITRe”m@it explains: And that which he writes, ‘even after his death,’ is according to the Midrash, because otherwise how does he know? Perhaps it is speaking of when he was alive as [the sages] comment [Sotah 13b) on the verse, I cannot any longer go forth and return, as Rashi explains above in @ITparshas@it Vayelech (31:2) [that this refers to while he was still alive].<QC>
@p1[10]@p2<TIE>He [Moshe] had an easy familiarity with Him, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: How one can possibly speak of Hashem having a face when He has no image or form? Therefore he explains that the meaning is not according to the plain connotation, but rather it means like a person who has easy familiarity with his fellow and speaks to him any time he desires. @p1[12]@p2<TIE>He received the Torah, etc.@bo Meaning that, For the entire strong hand refers to Moshe, and it means that he had the strength and power to take the Tablets in his hands even though they were very heavy. But it does not mean as everywhere else that it refers to Hashem, because if so it should have said, And for the entire strong hand that Moshe performed by the mouth of Hashem. @d1When he took the liberty of shattering the tablets, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: It should have said to all of Yisroel! Why does it say in view of all Yisroel? @d1The Holy One, Blessed Is He consented to his opinion, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: If the verse is now coming to relate Moshe’s praises, is this praise to Moshe that he broke the Tablets? Therefore he explains, The Holy One, Blessed Is He consented, etc. You might ask, how does the Midrash know to expound which (@hh<HEB>אשר@it<ENG>) you shattered means More power to you (@hh<HEB>יישר כחך@it<ENG>) for shattering them? Perhaps @hh<HEB>אשר@it<ENG> has the same meaning as it has everywhere else? The Ramban already answered in the first chapter of Bava Basra (14b) that this is expounded by juxtaposition. It is written above (10:2) [And I will write on the Tablets the words that were on the original Tablets] that you smashed, and you will place them [i.e. the smashed Tablets in the case]. We see [from this juxtaposition], that the smashed Tablets were beloved to Hashem, since if their smashing was displeasing to Him, He would not have said to place them in an ark, because “an accuser cannot become an advocate.” Therefore, because of this juxtaposition [over there], they expound @hh<HEB>אשר@it<ENG> [here] as meaning @hh<HEB>אשרי@it<ENG> (increase), [i.e. more power]. So far are his words. See his commentary on tractate Shabbos (87a).<QC>
