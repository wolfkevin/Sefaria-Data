@p1[1]@p2 R. Yitzchok said.@p3 Some commentators object that neither the Talmud nor the Midrash mention this statement in the name of R. Yitzchok. [The Midrash] states only what Rashi said [later]: @hh<HEB>מה טעם פתח בבראשית וכו'@ee<ENG> but states no more than that. [These commentators then explain] that R. Yitzchok was Rashi’s father and he was not a great Torah scholar. Rashi wished to honor his father by mentioning him in the beginning of his work. Thus Rashi asked his father to pose a difficulty that could be cited in his name. His father asked: @hh<HEB>למה התחיל בבראשית@ee<ENG> but did not ask @hh<HEB>מה טעם פתח בבראשית@ee<ENG> [as the Midrash does. Thus, Rashi cites the question in his father’s name.] This explanation, found in an old manuscript, is incorrect. For Rashi’s commentary on Avodah Zarah (75a) cites [a scholarly explanation of the Talmud] and says, “This is the explanation of my father, my teacher, may he rest in peace.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Thus it is clear that Rashi’s father was learned in Torah. (@ITDivrei Dovid@it) @p1@p2The Torah should have begun.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 This is because the Torah was given to Israel only for the mitzvos it contains, that they should keep them. (Thus it is called Torah, connoting “instructions”). If so, all these narratives should not have been written in the Torah, but they should have been made into a separate book, like Sefer Yehoshua or Sefer Shoftim. @p1@p2That the Israelites were commanded.@p3 The precepts of @ITmilah@it and @ITgid hanasheh@it [although they appear prior to “This month shall be.<TIE>.<TIE>.”] are different because they were commanded only to individuals (for their sake and for all Israel’s). It is only when all Israel is commanded that it is considered among the Torah’s precepts, for it is written (@ITDevarim@it 33:4): “The Torah that Moshe commanded @ITus@it.” @p1@p2What is the reason.<TIE>.<TIE>. begins with “In the beginning?” @p3This is not a question but [the start of] the answer. Rashi is saying: The verse in Tehillim explains the reason why the Torah begins with “In the beginning.” For the verse means, “He declared the power of His works” (i.e., the Creation of the world) “to His people.” Why? Because He wanted “to give them the inheritance of nations.” It is on account of Avraham, whom Hashem promised to give Eretz Canaan to his offspring, (and the inheritance was in reward for the mitzvos, and it is considered like the mitzvos). [Thus, the Torah indeed begins with the mitzvos]. For this reason [of giving them “the inheritance of nations,”] Hashem needed to declare that the Creation of the world is the power of His works. Alternatively, we could say [that Rashi is asking]: The Book of Bereishis should have been written [at the end,] after Parshas Haazinu. Why then does the Torah begin with it? Rashi answers: Because of “He declared the power of his works, etc.” Rashi is saying that if Bereishis would be at the end of the Torah, it would not be clear that the Torah’s intention was to testify that Bnei Yisrael are not robbers. Rather, we would think that Bereishis was written to teach that the world [is Hashem’s Creation and] did not always exist; this is central to our faith, as Ramban explains. But now that the Torah @ITbegins@it with Creation, we must say that the Torahs’s intention is to testify that “He declared the power of His works.<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1@p2You have taken by force the lands of the Seven Nations.@p3 This implies that originally it belonged to the Seven Nations (who are descendants of Cham). But you might object: It is written in Parshas Lech Lecha (12:6): “And the Canaanites were @ITthen@it in the Land,” and Rashi there explains that the Canaanites were then conquering the Land of Israel from the descendants of Shem — as it was given to Shem when Noach divided the earth among his sons. If so, why is it robbery (when Bnei Yisrael [who are Shem’s descendants] reclaim their inheritance)? @eeIt seems the answer is: Although land cannot be acquired by theft and always remains the property of the previous owner, nonetheless, Bnei Yisrael are like robbers. For the Canaanites were considered like someone who unrightfully seizes a field and makes improvements on it — in which case when the true owners return they must pay the one who seizes the land for his expenses, assuming the improvements are of greater value than the expenses. But Bnei Yisrael took the Land of Israel with all the improvements [that were made by the Canaanites], and did not pay even for the expenses. Therefore the Torah began with “In the beginning<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” to say that all the earth and its fullness belong to Hashem, Who may do with it as He wishes. For it says (Chavakuk 3:6): “He saw and @ITallowed@it the nations,” which is interpreted to mean that [in specific cases,] Hashem allowed their property to [be taken by] Israel (Bava Kama 38a). An alternative answer: “You are robbers” because Shem had other sons as well, and they too have a portion in the Land. However, there is a difficulty [with the first answer, that the descendants of Cham should be paid their expenses. And] even if we say that R. Yitzchok held the [other] view [mentioned in the Gemara,] that the entire Land [originally] belonged [not to Shem but] to Cham, who gave it to his son Canaan, [still their claim is invalid]. For it is written (9:25), “Cursed is Canaan. He shall surely be a slave to his brethren.” Thus, [the offspring of] Cham is enslaved to Shem, and all of a slave’s acquired property belongs to his master. [So whatever Canaan says is his, automatically belongs to Bnei Yisrael who are the offspring of Shem. Why, then, are Bnei Yisrael “robbers”?] An answer is: It is written that Canaan is a slave “to his brethren,” which includes Yefes. Thus, Yefes also has a share in what Canaan acquired, [not just Shem]. (@ITRe’m@it) Alternatively: [R. Yitzchok held that the Land originally belonged to Cham. And] a slave’s acquisitions belong to his master only when the slave acquires them from others, or seizes ownerless property — but not when the slave inherits them. And since it is by Torah law that a non-Jew inherits his father, Canaan rightfully inherited the Land from his father Cham. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) Another answer: When someone gives a gift to a slave and stipulates that the master should have no rights to it, the gift does not belong to the master. And here, Hashem apportioned specific territories to Canaan, and different territories to Shem, as the Torah recounts. Therefore, it is as if there is a stipulation that each one may not have any claim to the other one’s portion. (@ITDivrei Dovid@it) @p1@p2This verse insists that it be expounded@p3. This is because its simple meaning seems to teach the sequence of Creation. And this cannot be, as Rashi goes on to explain: “For the word @hh<HEB>ראשית@ee<ENG> never appears in Tanach except when it is annexed to the following word.” @p1@p2For the sake of the Torah. @p3This is because the word @hh<HEB>ראשית@ee<ENG> cannot mean the start [of the sequence of Creation], as then it would be annexed to the following word. Thus, @hh<HEB>בראשית@ee<ENG> means “For the sake of the [@hh<HEB>ראשית@ee<ENG>, which is the] Torah and Israel.” (The @hh<HEB>ב@ee<ENG> means “for the sake of”). @p1@p2But if you insist on the simple interpretation. @p3I.e., if you say that @hh<HEB>בראשית@ee<ENG> is a word annexed to the following word, then you must change the past tense verb @hh<HEB>בָּרָא@ee<ENG> into the “noun” @hh<HEB>ברוא@ee<ENG>, as if it was written @hh<HEB>בְּרִיאַת@ee<ENG> (the creating of) instead of @hh<HEB>בָּרָא@ee<ENG>. Thus, @hh<HEB>בְּרוֹא@ee<ENG> itself will be annexed [to the coming words. This interpretation is possible] because we may follow the way the Torah is written and handed down without vowelization, and therefore @hh<HEB>בָּרָא@ee<ENG> can be read as @hh<HEB>בְּרֹא@ee<ENG>. @p1@p2As if, “At the beginning of the creating.” @p3Thus, @hh<HEB>בראשית@ee<ENG> [and what follows] will mean: At the start of the creating of heaven and earth, the situation was that the earth was unformed and desolate, and darkness. And because it was dark, Hashem said, “Let there be light.” It all leads up to: Hashem said, “Let there be light.” @p1@p2As if to say, “At the beginning of Hashem’s speaking.<TIE>.<TIE>.”@p3 [Rashi cites this] so we will not ask: How can we say our verse means, “At the start of the creating of heaven and earth” — all leading up to the statement of “Hashem said, ‘Let there be light,’” which is the conclusion of what preceded? On the contrary: the statement of “Hashem said, ‘Let there be light’” seems to be a new and independent point, similar to: “Hashem said, ‘Let there be a canopy’” (v. 6). Thus, Rashi proves otherwise from Hoshe’a. For there we cannot say that Hoshe’a was the first man to whom Hashem spoke, as Hashem spoke to many prophets before him. [So then, what is the meaning of @hh<HEB>תחלת דבר ה' בהושע@ee<ENG>?] Perforce it means that the beginning of Hashem’s speaking to Hoshe’a was what follows: “Hashem said to Hoshe’a.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Thus, it all leads up to “Hashem said to Hoshe’a,” just like here. @p1@p2And its interpretation @BIis@bi that at the beginning of everything.@p3 And as for the objection [raised earlier], that @hh<HEB>ראשית@ee<ENG> is always annexed, the answer is that it means: “At the beginning of @ITeverything@it.” Thus, it is indeed annexed to the [understood but omitted] word “everything.” @p1@p2There are such verses that are shortened@p3. I.e., [the Torah occasionally omits a word] where we would logically understand by ourselves that a word is missing. (@ITDivrei Dovid@it) @p1@p2You must question yourself. Because water preceded.@p3 I.e., it is understandable if we say that the Torah is not stating the sequence of Creation. And it is not explaining when water was created, because it deals only with what was created after the heaven and earth. But if it @ITis@it stating the sequence of creation, the question arises: Why does it not mention also the creation of water? (@ITDivrei Dovid@it) @p1@p2The Torah not yet having revealed.<TIE>.<TIE>. @p3The creation of fire and of the angels was also not mentioned in the Torah, although [the angels] were created on the second day, [and the heavens were created from fire and water. If so, why does this not raise the same question? The answer is:] Water is different because the Torah mentions it in the sequence of creation: “The breath of Elohim hovered above the surface of the water” (v. 2). Thus, the time of its creation should be mentioned. @p1@p2Thus teaching that the waters preceded the earth@p3. [You might ask:] Why does Rashi give this answer here, and not above, where he said: “This verse does not intend to teach the sequence of creation”? The answer is: above, you could have deflected this answer, and argued that the Torah deals only with what came @ITafter@it the creation of heaven and earth. But now that Rashi is speaking of “the beginning of@IT everything@it,” this implies that nothing was created before heaven and earth. So here Rashi says: “You must question yourself.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1@p2It is not written “Adonoy created”!@p3 Rashi does not mean that it should say Adonoy without Elohim, for you would still ask: Why did the verse not say Elohim as well? Rather, Rashi means that the verse should say Adonoy as well, as it does later (2:4): “On the day when Adonoy Elohim made earth and heaven.” Rashi then continues to explain “at first He intended to create it with.<TIE>.<TIE>.” However, @ITMaharshal@it explains [differently], that the question Rashi is answering is: If the world would be created with the attribute of justice it could not exist for even a moment! Thus, He must have created it with the attribute of mercy. If so, why did the verse not say “Adonoy”? The verse should say, “Adonoy created,” using His essential Name, for His Essence expresses mercy. But it should not say Elohim, a Name descriptive of a judge, for He did not yet judge the earth. Thus Rashi answers, “First He intended to create.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (@ITDivrei Dovid@it) @p1@p2This is conveyed in the verse, “On the day when Adonoy Elohim made.”@p3 Rashi might be bringing this verse also to answer the question: Why say that Hashem added the attribute of mercy because He saw that the world cannot exist with justice alone? The reason is for it is written (Tehillim 89:3), “The world will be built with kindness,” or perhaps there was a different reason. Furthermore, why did He give priority to the attribute of mercy? @eeRashi answers by citing the verse, “On the day when Adonoy Elohim made earth and heaven” (2:4). And why does the verse not mention heaven before earth like the first verse did, “In the beginning Elohim created the heavens and the earth”? The answer is: to show that Hashem added the attribute of mercy mainly for sake of the earth and what emerged from it, for the earth cannot stand up to the attribute of justice. Thus He gave priority to mercy over justice, so that mercy would be stronger, for the sake of the earth. The heavens, however, can stand up to the attribute of justice.<QC>
@p1[2]@p2 Desolation and empty space. @p3It seems that Rashi treats @hh<HEB>ריקות וצדו@ee<ENG> as synonyms; both mean desolation. Alternatively, Rashi is saying that @hh<HEB>ריקות@ee<ENG> is biblical Hebrew and @hh<HEB>צדיא@ee<ENG> is Aramaic, both meaning desolation. And Rashi disagrees with Targum Onkelos, who translates @hh<HEB>תוהו ובהו@ee<ENG> [respectively,] as desolation and empty space. Rashi explains @hh<HEB>בהו@ee<ENG> as desolation and empty space, and @hh<HEB>תהו@ee<ENG> as astonishment, i.e., that one would be astonished by its emptiness. Thus the @hh<HEB>ו@ee<ENG> of @hb<HEB>ו@hhבהו@ee<ENG> is like a @hh<HEB>ב@ee<ENG>, for @hh<HEB>ו@ee<ENG> is interchangeable with @hh<HEB>ב@ee<ENG>, as in (Yeshayah 48:16): “@hh<HEB>אֲדֹנָי יֱהֹוִה שְׁלָחַנִי @hbוְ@hhרוּחוֹ@ee<ENG>,” which means, “Hashem Elohim has sent me @ITwith@it His Spirit (@hb<HEB>ב@hhרוחו@ee<ENG>).” @p1@p2Upon the waters. @p3Rashi is answering the question: It should say simply @hh<HEB>על תהום@ee<ENG>. Why does it say @hh<HEB>על @hbפני@hh תהום@ee<ENG>? It must refer to the water that is upon the earth, and is the surface (@hh<HEB>פני@ee<ENG>) of the earth. The verse continues similarly, “The breath of Elohim hovered above the @ITsurface@it of the water.” This [surface] is like [the surface] mentioned earlier regarding the darkness: “And darkness covered the @ITsurface@it of the abyss.” Another explanation is: The proof for Rashi’s comment [that the waters were upon the earth] is that prior to each of these ten Divine utterances of Creation, the subject of the utterance did not exist. Thus Hashem needed to say, “Let there be.<TIE>.<TIE>.” For example, first it is written: “In the beginning Elohim created the heavens and the earth. The earth was unformed and desolate,” implying there was only the earth, with nothing upon it. Thus it says later: “Elohim said, ‘Let the earth sprout grass.’” Accordingly, when it says: “Elohim said, ‘Let there be light,’” beforehand there was only darkness [upon the earth]. But where it is written that there was darkness? It must be that when it is written, “And darkness covered the surface of the @hh<HEB>תהום@ee<ENG>,” and @hh<HEB>תהום@ee<ENG> always means water. Perforce, the waters were upon the @ITearth@it — [and for the sake of the earth, light was created]. @eeRashi earlier implied that “Let there be light” connects back to the “darkness covered the surface of the abyss,” as he explained (@hh<HEB>בד"ה בראשית ברא@ee<ENG>): “At the beginning of the creation.<TIE>.<TIE>. and darkness covered the surface of the abyss.<TIE>.<TIE>. Hashem said, ‘Let there be light.’” Rashi could have quoted the entire verse, or not have quoted it at all. By quoting only, “Let there be light.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Rashi implies that the creation of light connects back to the darkness on the abyss. I.e., if not for the darkness upon it, Hashem would not have commanded that there be light. @p1@p2The Throne of Glory. @p3Rashi is answering the question: Why did it not say simply, “The breath hovered above.<TIE>.<TIE>.”? @p1@p2Hovering over the surface of the waters.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: If the verse is referring to the Throne of Glory, why does it say it was hovering? It should simply say, “The breath of Elohim was above the waters.” [Thus Rashi explains that it was hovering in space.] Alternatively, Rashi is answering the question: Why is the Throne of Glory called “the breath of Elohim”? [The answer is: It was hovering.] @p1@p2And his word.@p3 @hh<HEB>מרחפת@ee<ENG> refers to Hashem’s word and His breath [which supported the @hh<HEB>רוח אלהים@ee<ENG>, i.e., the Throne of Glory].<QC>
@p1[4]@p2 The Aggadaic explanation is necessary@p3. This is because the verse’s simple meaning implies that light and darkness originally were mingled, for “to divide” is said only about things that are mingled with each other. But this cannot be true here, since darkness disappears the moment there is light. The two cannot exist simultaneously. (@ITRe’m@it) @ee[Alternatively,] Rashi’s question was as follows: How could Hashem establish that the darkness be bounded by the night, when this division did not actually take place until the fourth day, on which it is written (v. 14): “To divide between the day and the night”? Therefore, the Aggadaic explanation is necessary. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1@p2He saw that it was not fitting@p3.<TIE>.<TIE>. @ITRamban@it objected: This makes it seem that Hashem reconsidered and changed His plan. For Hashem said, “Let there be light” and then “He saw that the light was good” and had to set it apart — implying that at first, He did not know that the light would be good. And this is far from the truth! @ITRe’m@it deflected this objection, saying that such an idea is mentioned later as well, [regarding Generation of the Flood]: “Adonoy saw that man’s wickedness had increased.<TIE>.<TIE>. and Adonoy’s @ITthought turned@it.<TIE>.<TIE>.” [as Rashi explains it there (6:5)]. @ITNachalas Yaakov @itchallenged @ITRe’m@it: Although Hashem reconsidered in v. 6:5, it is no proof for our issue, since everything is in the hands of Heaven except for the fear of Heaven. [And there they sinned greatly, bringing about Hashem’s change of thought]. @p1@p2He set it apart for the righteous@p3. I.e., “good” in our verse refers to the righteous one. Thus Hashem “divided,” to set apart the righteous one, who is light, from the wicked one, who is darkness. (@ITRe’m@it) @p1@p2In confusion@p3. This means that one territory would have light while another has darkness. Or, it means hours: it would be day for one hour and then night for two hours, and then the opposite; that was the confusion. But it cannot mean light and darkness simultaneously, because this is impossible, as explained earlier (@hh<HEB>בד"ה צריכין לדברי אגדה@ee<ENG>). Accordingly, “Elohim divided” means that He divided their times; one to be bounded by the day, and the other, by the night. @p1[5]@p2 It should have said “the first day.”@p3 [You might ask:] Later it is written concerning the four rivers (2:11): “The name of the @ITone@it <HS><HS>is Pishon,” although afterwards it is written “the second” and “the third.” [Why does this not raise the same question?] The answer is: If there it would say “the first,” we might think that what is stated, “And from there it separated and became four headwaters” (2:10) means that the rivers separated off from one another successively, in four different places, rather than breaking into four headwaters at one place. For example, the second river might separate off several miles downstream from “the first” river, and so forth. Thus it says “one,” and not “first,” to prevent us from making this error. Accordingly, “second” and “third” reflects importance rather than location. @p1@p2This is because.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 @ITNachalas Yaakov@it [diverged from Rashi and] agreed with @ITRamban@it [that it says “one day”] because the Torah is written as if copied from a sequence of events recorded as they happened. That is why the entire Torah is [written] in the present tense. And initially, the second day was not yet in existence, so it was appropriate for the first day to be called “one” [whereas “first” is a relative term that is followed by a “second”]. @p1[6]@p2 Be solidified@p3. Rashi is answering the question: [“Let there be a @hh<HEB>רקיע@ee<ENG>” implies that it was created now.] But was the @hh<HEB>שמים@ee<ENG> [which is the @hh<HEB>רקיע@ee<ENG>, see v. 8,] not already created earlier? [For it says (1:1), “In the beginning Elohim created the heavens and the earth.” Thus Rashi answers, “Be solidified.”] Although the simple interpretation of verse 1:1 is explained there by Rashi as, “At the beginning of the creating of heaven and earth,” implying that Hashem did not yet create the heavens, this does not mean that the heavens were not created on the first day. Rather, the Torah was starting to recount how heaven and earth were created on the first day. @p1@p2“Quivered.”@p3 @hh<HEB>ירופפו@ee<ENG> means they were weak and loose. @p1@p2Astonished. @hh<HEB>יתמהו@ee<ENG> means they were startled and strengthened. @p1@p2Because the separation.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi’s proof is not because it is written, “@hh<HEB>בתוך@ee<ENG> the waters” and that @hh<HEB>בתוך@ee<ENG> means “in the middle.” For it is written (Shemos 15:19), “Bnei Yisrael walked on dry land @hh<HEB>בתוך@ee<ENG> the sea,” and it was not in the middle [of the sea]. Rather, the proof is from what is written: “And let it divide between waters and waters.” Since the canopy is in the midst of the waters, obviously it divides between waters and waters! It must therefore mean that the upper waters are separated from the canopy in the same manner as the lower waters are separated from the canopy. Thus, the canopy is in the middle.<QC>
@p1@p2[7] He fixed it.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Were the heavens not already created on the first day? @p1@p2Similar to, “And she made [fixed].<TIE>.<TIE>.”@p3 I.e., @hh<HEB>ועשתה@ee<ENG> also means fixing [i.e., improving]. You might object: There (Devarim 21:12), Rashi explained that @hh<HEB>ועשתה@ee<ENG> means that she lets her nails grow in order to make herself repulsive. Thus it means [the opposite], not fixing up! The answer is: letting the nails grow indeed improves them, although it makes the woman appear repulsive. Hence, Rashi’s proof from @hh<HEB>ועשתה@ee<ENG> is valid. (@ITRe’m@it) Another answer: By letting her nails grow, although it makes her repulsive, it will eventually improve her status — for otherwise she is prohibited to marry. (@ITMaharshal@it) The term @hh<HEB>עשייה@ee<ENG> clearly means fixing, according to all views, as the Gemara (Yevamos 48a) proves from @hh<HEB>מפיבושת@ee<ENG>, about whom it says, @hh<HEB>ולא עשה רגליו ולא עשה שפמו@ee<ENG> (Shmuel II, 19:25). Although in that Gemara, Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Eliezer disagree whether @hh<HEB>ועשתה@ee<ENG> means letting her nails grow or trimming them, the reasons for their views are explained there. (@ITNachalas Yaakov, @itsee further elaboration there) @p1@p2Because they are suspended in space@p3. A question arises: Do we not learn from, “Let there be a canopy @ITin the midst@it of the waters,” that the waters were suspended, as Rashi explained earlier? The answer is: Both phrases are needed. If it said only, “in the midst of the waters,” we would know that there is a separation between the canopy and the upper waters, but we would not know that they were suspended. Only the phrase “from above the canopy” teaches us this point. And if it said only, “from above the canopy,” we would know that the waters were suspended in space, but we would not know that there is such a big separation [between them and the canopy]. Only the phrase “in the midst” teaches us this point. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it)<QC>
@p1@p2And why does it not state.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 You might ask: How is this question relevant to [the waters being suspended, which is the subject] here? The answer is: We would say that the Torah omitted “It was good” when referring to the canopy since it disobeyed Hashem’s command. For Hashem said, “Let there be a canopy in @ITthe midst of@it the waters,” teaching that it should be equally distant from the upper waters and the lower waters. And we might think that the canopy did not do so, and the upper waters were right on it. Similarly, we find that the earth disobeyed Hashem’s command, as Rashi explains later (v. 11) regarding the fruit trees. But now that Rashi explains that the waters are suspended in space, we see that the canopy obeyed Hashem’s command. If so, why does it not state, “It was good”? Another answer: [We would say that] the lower waters are jealous of the upper waters which actually touch the canopy — hence it does not say, “It was good.” But now that Rashi explains that even the upper waters do not touch the canopy, the question arises: why does it not state, “It was good”? [Another answer: We would say that] the Torah omits “It was good” because the creation of the waters is not finished, since the object upon which the upper waters would rest was not yet created. But now that Rashi tells us that they are suspended in the air, the creation of the waters was apparently completed. Thus the question arises: Why does it not state about them, “It was good”? (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1@p2Because the work involving the water was not completed.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 You might ask: Why does it not state, “It was good” on day two for the completion of the canopy, as Rashi explained earlier (v. 6) that it was fluid but solidified on the second day? The answer is: The gathering of the waters [on the third day] was a work on its own, as well as the completion of day two’s work. But the canopy’s solidification only completed the earlier work and was not a work on its own. And the phrase, “It was good” is inappropriate just for the completion of an earlier work. (@ITRe’m@it) Another answer is: The canopy’s solidification was not a [significant] act since it did not change from its original appearance; rather, the fluid merely thickened. Thus, “It was good” is inappropriate. You might object: [If so,] why does it not state, “It was good” three times on day three? Twice as Rashi said, and a third for the completion of the earth’s work — as it is written (v. 9), “And let the dryness be seen,” as Rashi explains there [that this refers to the earth]. For the earth changed from its original appearance! The answer is: This is not called a change, for the earth remained the same — only that before it was not visible [due to the water covering it]. @p1[8]@p2 Carrying of water. @p3[This interpretation arises] because there is no difference between @ITshin @itand @ITsin @itwhen we explain the Torah as it is written [rather than how it is pronounced]. Thus, it is as if the Torah expressly wrote @hh<HEB>שָׂמָיִם@ee<ENG>. Furthermore, a @ITkamatz@it is naturally followed by an @ITalef, @itso it comes out @hh<HEB>שָׂא מָיִם@ee<ENG>. @p1@p2There is water@p3. This interpretation answers the question: How could we say that @hh<HEB>שמים@ee<ENG> means “carrying of water,” when earlier (@hh<HEB>בפסוק ו ד"ה בתוך@ee<ENG>) Rashi explained that there is a separation between the waters [and the canopy]? Thus Rashi answers that @hh<HEB>שמים@ee<ENG> also means “there is water” — i.e., the canopy does not directly carry the water. In truth, the water is there above it, and through the separation it is as if the canopy carries the water. Then Rashi answers an objection: [If so,] why does the Torah not simply write @hh<HEB>שם מים@ee<ENG>, and then the error will not arise, to say that the canopy carries the water? Rashi answers that @hh<HEB>שמים@ee<ENG> also means @hh<HEB>אש ומים@ee<ENG>, and for this reason the Torah wrote @hh<HEB>שמים@ee<ENG>, which is interpreted as @hh<HEB>שא מים@ee<ENG> — and @hh<HEB>שא@ee<ENG> is the same letters as @hh<HEB>אש@ee<ENG>. Thus, the Torah teaches that Hashem blended fire and water to make the heavens. You might object: Perhaps the only reason why the Torah wrote @hh<HEB>שמים@ee<ENG> is for the meaning of @hh<HEB>אש ומים@ee<ENG>. How do we know that it means also @hh<HEB>שם מים@ee<ENG>? The answer is: Otherwise it should have been called @hh<HEB>אש ומים@ee<ENG>. @eeWe need not ask: Why did Rashi not mention these three interpretations before, [when the Torah first wrote] @hh<HEB>שמים@ee<ENG>? The answer is: @hh<HEB>שמים@ee<ENG> is [usually] a proper noun, but here it is an adjective, for it is written, “Elohim called the canopy @hh<HEB>שמים@ee<ENG>.” That is why Rashi mentioned these interpretations here. @ee[Alternatively,] Rashi cites all three explanations to teach that fire is not located in one place while water is in another, and to teach that they are [not merely in one place but are] mingled with each other. (@ITDivrei Dovid@it) @p1[10]@p2 He called seas. Is there not but one sea? @p3I.e., all other seas flow from the Ocean, as it says (Koheles 1:7): “All the rivers flow into the sea.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1@p2At Spain@p3. For in Spain, the fish are better. @p1[11]@p2 @hh<HEB>דשא@p1@p2<ENG> is not synonymous with.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Why did it not say: @hh<HEB>תדשא הארץ דשא מזריע זרע@ee<ENG> [omitting @hh<HEB>עשב@ee<ENG>], or @hh<HEB>תעשיב הארץ עשבים@ee<ENG> [omitting @hh<HEB>דשא@ee<ENG>]? @p1@p2That its seed is grown within it@p3. Rashi is answering the question: Is @hh<HEB>מזריע@ee<ENG> not a transitive verb that indicates an ongoing action? @p1@p2So that it can be resown elsewhere.@p3 Meaning, the person’s ability to sow the seed in another place is the verb’s ongoing action. @p1@p2However, it [the earth] did not do this@p3. @ITMaharshal@it asked: Why did the earth disobey? The answer is: Hashem commanded it to bring forth fruit trees in a way similar to herbs, whose stalks and leaves are similar. Thus the earth understood that the fruit trees too should be this way, i.e., the wood should be edible like the fruit. But the earth reasoned as follows: Herbs have stalks and leaves that are naturally similar, yet the stalks are inedible without some preparation. However, the wood and fruit of trees are naturally dissimilar, and rightly so. Thus, even if they were to be made similar, the wood will need a lot of changing and preparation to become edible. Thus, the earth did not do this. This explains why in Hashem’s command, it says @hh<HEB>למינו@ee<ENG> once for herbs and trees together, but in the earth’s action it is written @hh<HEB>למינהו@ee<ENG> for each one separately. For when Hashem commanded the herbs and the trees to be the same, @hh<HEB>למינו@ee<ENG> applied equally to both. But when the earth disobeyed [and made them different], it is written @hh<HEB>למינהו@ee<ENG> twice. @p1@p2It, too, was punished for its sin@p3. [You might ask:] Rashi later comments as follows on the earth’s curse (3:17): “This is comparable to one who adopts evil ways and people curse the breasts at which he was suckled.” Does this not imply that the earth was not punished for its own sin, [but for Adam’s]? The answer is: Both sins caused the punishment. Perforce Chazal said there, “This is comparable to one who adopts evil ways.<TIE>.<TIE>.” because in that verse it says, “The soil will be cursed because of @ITyou@it [Adam],” which implies: it was not cursed for its own sin. (@ITRe’m@it) [Furthermore,] if the earth was cursed for its sin alone, why was it not cursed immediately, but only when Adam sinned? And if it was cursed only because of Adam, the curse should be in what affects man alone, such as emitting flies and mosquitoes — not by changing the earth’s own nature, to grow thorns and thistles. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) How is the earth’s sin connected to Adam’s? It seems that the earth’s sin caused Adam to sin, as Adam ate from the esrog tree, whose wood and fruit have the same taste. This quality was unique, thus he desired to eat from it. But if the earth had not sinned, the wood and fruit of every tree would be this way, and man would not have desired the esrog tree, through which he sinned. Therefore, the earth was punished together with Adam. (@ITDivrei Dovid@it) @p1@p2These are the kernels.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Why is it written @hh<HEB>אשר זרעו בו@ee<ENG> concerning the trees, but @hh<HEB>מזריע זרע@ee<ENG> concerning the herbs? Thus Rashi explains, “These are the kernels.<TIE>.<TIE>.” meaning that new trees are grown mainly through grafting or planting a branch from another tree, [although the kernels, too, may be planted]. Thus it says here @hh<HEB>אשר זרעו בו@ee<ENG>, [omitting @hh<HEB>מזריע זרע@ee<ENG>], since the fruit’s kernels are not its [primary] means of planting. But herbs are planted only by their seeds, thus it says @hh<HEB>מזריע@ee<ENG> concerning them. (@ITDevek Tov@it)<QC>
@p1[12]@p2<TIE>Though @hh<HEB>למינהו@p1@p2<ENG> was not said.<TIE>.<TIE>. they applied a @hh<HEB>קל וחומר@ee<ENG>. [Their @hh<HEB>קל וחומר@ee<ENG> was:] Trees are large, with many large branches, and cannot stand close together. And even if they were to intermingle, their species are distinguishable from one another. Nevertheless, they must come forth each according to their kind. All the more should we herbs come forth each according to our kind. For we are small; and if we were to intermingle we would be indistinguishable from one another! @p1[14]@p2 Were created from the first day. @p3Rashi is answering the question: It should have said first, “Let there be luminaries,” marking their creation. And then, “And the luminaries shall be in the canopy,” marking their suspension in the canopy. [Thus Rashi explains, “They were created from the first day.”]<QC>
@p1@p2Was stored away.<TIE>.<TIE>. @p3Rashi is answering the question: It is already written (v. 4): “Elohim divided the light from the darkness.” @p1@p2You need not worry. @p3But if they follow the ways of the gentiles, they indeed should fear. @p1@p2By the new moon. @p3This results from the interaction of both luminaries [sun and moon], as known to astronomers. Thus the Torah connects the holidays to both. @p1@p2A complete day. @p3In other words, [each luminary has its own] complete day of twelve hours. @p1@p2After 365 days. @p3365 days is for the solar year, while the lunar year of 354 days is included in the solar year. Since the solar year is determined by the sun’s cycle through the twelve constellations [of the zodiac], and the lunar year is determined by the moon’s interaction with the sun in each of these constellations, Rashi connects the [solar] year to both sun and moon — although in truth, the moon completes its cycle [through each constellation] in twenty-nine days and a specific number of hours. (@ITRe’m@it) @p1[15]@p2 They serve another purpose, that they provide light. @p3This is in addition to the purpose of, “Divide between the day and the night.” @p1@p2For the world. @p3Rashi explains that the sun and moon are to provide light for living beings. Thus Rashi says @hh<HEB>לעולם@ee<ENG>, rather than @hh<HEB>על הארץ@ee<ENG> as the verse does — to indicate that the light is for the people of the earth, since the earth itself does not need light. @p1@p2[16] They were created equal. @p3Rashi is answering the question: At first it is written, “The @ITtwo great@it lights.” Why does it then say, “The @ITlarge@it light.<TIE>.<TIE>. and the @ITsmall@it light”? @p1@p2Because He diminished.@p3 This explains why it is not written, “Let there be stars,” or, “And He made the stars.” (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1[20]@p2 That it will have a living soul@p3. Rashi is answering the question: Our verse implies that the waters brought forth the living creatures. But it is written further on (v. 21), “Elohim created.<TIE>.<TIE>. every living creature,” [implying that He created them directly]? Thus Rashi explains, “That it @ITwill have@it a living soul.” In other words, the waters prepared the body that will later receive the living soul given by Hashem. And this is in accordance with Rashi’s comment further on “[Elohim created].<TIE>.<TIE>. every living creature” (ibid.), where he says, “That @IThas@it in it a living soul,” [in the present tense]. Alternatively, Rashi is answering the question: [@hh<HEB>נפש חיה@ee<ENG> usually means land animals,] but those animals were created later (v. 24) from the ground. Thus Rashi explains that here it means living beings. And Rashi needed to explain this a second time (v. 21) because there it says @hh<HEB>נפש @hbה@hhחיה@ee<ENG> with the definite article @hh<HEB>ה@ee<ENG>, implying actual animals — which cannot be true, since it is written there, “with which the @ITwaters@it teem.” And on day six (v. 24) Rashi needed to explain this a third time because there [after this phrase] it is written, “@ITAnd@it beasts of the earth.” Thus, @hh<HEB>נפש חיה@ee<ENG> [that is written just before it] must mean living beings in general, and refers [also] to the creeping things. (@ITDevek Tov@it) @p1@p2Any living thing.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi reverses the order and explains @hh<HEB>נפש חיה@ee<ENG> before @hh<HEB>שרץ@ee<ENG> because the verse, too, needs be understood this way: “Let the waters teem with living creatures,” which consist of: “swarms and birds.” For so it is written later (v. 24), “Let the earth bring forth living creatures, each of its kind: animals [of pasture], creeping things.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1@p2Beetles and worms.@p3 These are the worms found in refuse, and also on the ground in the summer after it rains. @p1@p2Among [larger] creatures.@p3 I.e., among larger animals, beasts, etc. @p1[21]@p2 According to the Aggadah this refers to the Leviasan@p3. Rashi is answering the question: Why did it specify @hh<HEB>התנינם@ee<ENG>, as opposed to any other creature? And why were they singled out among all living beings by the definite article @hh<HEB>ה@ee<ENG>? Thus Rashi explains, “According to the Aggadah.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (@ITDevek Tov@it) @p1@p2He killed the female@p3. Rashi is answering the question: It is written @hh<HEB>התנינם@ee<ENG> without the @hh<HEB>י@ee<ENG> of the plural form, implying there was only one. Yet we read it as @hh<HEB>התנינ@hbי@hhם@ee<ENG>, plural. Thus Rashi explains that Hashem created them male and female, and therefore we read it in the plural form. But later He killed the female, and that is why it is written in the singular form. (@ITDevek Tov@it) @p1[22]@p2<TIE>Because they are decimated. @p3[Rashi knows this because] the blessing is not needed so that they can [naturally] multiply. For they are Hashem’s own creation and thus are inherently blessed [with the ability to multiply]. (@ITRe’m@it) @p1@p2The animals also.<TIE>.<TIE>. but since the serpent@p3.<TS>.<TS>. We need not ask why the animals remain numerous although Hashem did not bless them and they are constantly decimated. For the answer is: The blessings given to man also included the animals, since they reproduce in a fashion similar to man. This is preferable to @ITRe’m’s@it answer@IT @itthat the fish’s blessing was in general, for all @hh<HEB>נפש חיה@ee<ENG>, and also included the animals, who are @hh<HEB>נפש חיה@ee<ENG>. [You might ask:] Mankind was blessed although they are not constantly decimated. Why was being created by the will of their Creator insufficient [to make them inherently blessed]? A possible answer is: Hashem knew that Adam would eat from the Tree of Knowledge, and become affected by the Snake’s impurity, thus receiving an evil inclination — causing many wars in the world. @p1@p2Give birth to many@p3. This means in one birth, i.e., twins. We need not ask: It could say just @hh<HEB>רְבוּ@ee<ENG>. Why say also @hh<HEB>פְּרוּ@ee<ENG>? For [the answer is:] We would not know whether @hh<HEB>רְבוּ@ee<ENG> means many offspring or great height. Similarly we find in Parshas Bechukosai (Vayikra 26:9), on the verse @hh<HEB>והרביתי אתכם@ee<ENG>, which means “erect stature.” But by saying both @hh<HEB>פְּרוּ@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>רְבוּ@ee<ENG>, we understand that @hh<HEB>רְבו@ee<ENG> is connected to @hh<HEB>פְּרוּ@ee<ENG>, and means many offspring. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1[24]@p2<TIE>What I have already explained.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Why is it not written, “Elohim created”? Whereas “Bring forth” implies it was already created but was covered by the earth. [Thus Rashi explains, “Everything was actually created from the first day.”] But the earlier verse (v. 12), “The earth brought forth grass,” does not prove this. For there it means that the earth brought to actuality what it was commanded (v. 11): “Let the earth sprout grass.” This is so because being commanded creates a potential [which can then be brought to actuality]. But it is different in our verse, where “Let the earth bring forth” is the commandment itself, without there being a prior potential existence. (@ITRe’m@it) @p1@p2[A soul] which is alive@p3. On v. 20, “Let the waters teem,” Rashi explained: “It @ITwill have@it a living soul.” But here he explains differently [and says: “It @IThas@it a living soul.” Why?] The answer seems to be: The beasts of the earth were completely created on the first day, with their living soul. For about them it is written, “Let the earth bring forth,” [but does not say, “Elohim created.”] Whereas for the fish and birds, only the ability to swarm as bodies was created on the first day, without the living soul. For about them it is written (v. 21): “And thus Elohim @ITcreated.<TIE>.<TIE>.@it” [referring to their living souls]. @p1[25]@p2<TIE>According to their desire@p3. @hh<HEB>בצביונם@ee<ENG> means according to their will, i.e., if the animal had originally been asked: “Do you want to be created like this?” it would have agreed. @p1@p2And their full size@p3. I.e., they were full-sized from the beginning. Rashi is answering the question: Why is it written here, “And thus Elohim made.<TIE>.<TIE>.” after it is already written (v. 24), “And it was so”? [To teach that they were created as they desired, and fullsized. Similarly we may ask:] For the grass, why did it say, “The earth brought forth grass” (v. 12), after it already said, “And it was so”? To teach that the earth disobeyed, as Rashi explained there (@hh<HEB>רש"י פסוק יא ד"ה עץ@ee<ENG>). And for the luminaries, why did it say, “Elohim made” (v. 16), after it already said, “And it was so”? To teach that Hashem diminished one of them. (@ITRe’m@it) @p1[26]@p2<TIE>They were jealous of him@p3. This raises a question: Are angels indeed jealous? [Apparently not] for at the Giving of the Torah, @ITChazal@it say [that Moshe answered the angels rhetorical-ly]: “Is there jealousy among you?” (Shabbos 89a). The answer seems to be: Angels surely are not jealous of each other. But they are jealous of man, who was granted loftiness similar to theirs, although he is formed from clay. @p1@p2By the decree@p3. I.e., as the angels decree and speak before Hashem, so the matter stands. Thus we see that Hashem consults the angels. @p1@p2The attribute of humility, that.<TIE>.<TIE>. @p3But before, Rashi explained that [Hashem consulted the angels] so they would not be jealous. [Why does Rashi explain here that it was to teach humility?] The answer is: Hashem could have ignored the angels’ jealousy. Nonetheless, He showed humility and consulted them, to remove grounds for jealousy. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1@p2Had it been written.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 And then, the heretics would not err. @p1@p2In our form@p3. This means: the form we prepared for man. It cannot mean the form of Hashem, for He has no form or image, as written in Parshas Va’es’chanan (Devarim 4:12): “But you saw no image.” Thus, @hh<HEB>בצלמנו@ee<ENG> means: in the form we made for him, just as @hh<HEB>בצלמו@ee<ENG> (v. 27) means “in the form that was made for him,” as Rashi says there. And when Rashi says later (v. 27, @hh<HEB>ד"ה בצלם@ee<ENG>), “The form that was made for man is the form of the @ITimage of his Creator@it,” it means the image that Hashem used when revealing Himself to the prophets. Furthermore, Rashi there says, “The form of the image of his Creator” only because he is explaining the double expression of @hh<HEB>בצלמו בצלם אלהים@ee<ENG>. Thus, @hh<HEB>בצלמו@ee<ENG> means the form that was made for man, while @hh<HEB>בצלם אלהים@ee<ENG> means the image of his Creator. See @ITRe’m@it. @p1@p2To understand and to be intellectually creative@p3. Rashi is answering the question: [How is man in the likeness of angels, when] man has a body and the angels do not? @p1@p2This expression @HB<HEB>וְיִרְדוּ@BO<ENG> has [the meaning of] ruling.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Meaning, if we read @hh<HEB>וְ@hbיִ@hhרְדוּ@ee<ENG> it means ruling, and if we read it @hh<HEB>וְ@hbיֵ@hhרְדוּ@ee<ENG> it means descending. [Alternatively,] here it is written @hh<HEB>וירדו@ee<ENG> [with a @ITyud@it], meaning descending, but later (v. 28) it is written @hh<HEB>ורְדו@ee<ENG> [without a @ITyud@it], meaning domination. Here, where Hashem spoke to the angels, He minimized man, saying he is lower even than the fish, not to mention the beasts of the earth. But when Hashem spoke to man (v. 28), He boosted his pride, saying that if he will be righteous he will dominate the beasts and cattle. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1[27]@p2<TIE>In the form.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: It already said (v. 26), “Let us make man in our image.” Why say here also, “In his image?” (@ITDevek Tov@it)<QC>
@p1[28]@p2<TIE>[@HB<HEB>וכבשה@hh@p2<ENG> is spelled] without a @BIvav@bi to teach you@p3. Accordingly, we read it @hh<HEB>וּכְבָשָׁהּ@hh@ee<ENG>. @p1@p2Whose way it is to subdue@p3. This means that man, who goes out to subdue [the enemy] in war, is commanded to be fruitful and multiply. Another explanation: A man subdues a woman for marital relations even if she is not desirous, but a woman cannot subdue him since he is incapable of relations if he lacks desire. This is what the verse is saying: “Be fruitful and multiply.<TIE>.<TIE>. and subdue” — referring to the one whose way it is to subdue. (@ITTzeidah LaDerech@it) Rashi gave two explanations [“not be a gadabout” and “whose way it is to subdue”] because the first explanation raises the question: Why is it mentioned in connection with the blessing? Thus Rashi explained, “Also to teach you.<TIE>.<TIE>.” And the second explanation raises the question: Why does the verse not say [in opposite order], “Subdue.<TIE>.<TIE>. be fruitful and multiply.<TIE>.<TIE>. and dominate”? (@ITMaharshal@it)<QC>
@p1[29]@p2<TIE>He equates@p3. This means that since the Torah equated them concerning food, and we know that animals may eat only vegetation, but may not eat man. For it is written above, “And [man shall] dominate the fish of the sea etc,” implying that man shall dominate them but they shall not dominate man. Thus, since man and animals are equated, [we learn that] man may eat only vegetation and may not kill an animal. It follows that man’s permission to dominate the animals refers to using them for work, not for food. (@ITRe’m@it) See Sanhedrin 59b. @p1@p2To kill any creature@p3. This implies that only killing an animal is forbidden, but if it died naturally, they may eat it. You might ask: How does Rashi know [that such meat is permitted, when on the contrary, regarding man’s food] it is written: “I have given you all seed-yielding herbs.<TIE>.<TIE>.”? The answer is: They were commanded not to eat a limb from a @ITliving@it animal, as explained in Sanhedrin 56b. This proves Rashi’s point, for if an animal that died naturally is forbidden, certainly a living animal is forbidden! But if an animal that died naturally is permitted, since man did not kill it, one might think that a limb from a living animal is also permitted, if man did not sever it and the animal does not die as a result. [Thus they were commanded not to eat it.] @p1@p2When the “sons of Noach” came.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi says this to prove that meat was prohibited to Adam HaRishon, for when the sons of Noach came [out of the Ark], Hashem needed to permit meat to them. @p1[31]@p2 The letter @HB<HEB>ה@BO@bo<ENG>[=5]@BO was added.<TIE>.<TIE>. He stipulated with them.<TIE>.<TIE>. @p3I.e., Hashem created heaven and earth for this end [that Bnei Yisrael should accept the the Five Books of the Torah].<QC>
@p1@p2Another explanation .<TIE>.<TIE>. They all are pending .<TIE>.<TIE>. @p3See explanation in Avodah Zarah (3a) and Shabbos (88a). @p1[2]@p2 R. Shimon said, flesh and blood who cannot know.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: @hh<HEB>ויכל אלהים @hbב@hhיום השביעי@ee<ENG> implies that Hashem worked even on the seventh day, but concluded the work then. Yet it is written, “He abstained on the seventh day,” implying that He did no work at all. [Thus Rashi explains, “It @ITappears@it as if He concluded His work on that very day.”] @p1@p2It can enter into it@p3. I.e., the work enters into Shabbos. @p1@p2And it appears@p3. I.e., it appears to people as if Hashem concluded His work on that day, but it is not really so. Thus, “Elohim completed on the seventh day” describes the appearance, not the reality.<QC>
@p1@p2Another explanation: What was the world lacking? Rest@p3. You might ask: Why cannot the world exist without [a day devoted to] rest? Will heaven and earth otherwise cease to exist? The answer is: In fact they would [cease to exist], for Rashi explained above (1:1) that @hh<HEB>בראשית@ee<ENG> means that the world was created for the Torah which is called @hh<HEB>ראשית דרכו@ee<ENG>. And without a day of rest, Jews would not have time all week to engage in Torah study. Thus Hashem created Shabbos on which work is forbidden, giving them time to study Torah. Consequently, the existence of heaven and earth is due to rest. @p1@p2The work was completed and finished@p3. This explains why it is written, “Elohim completed @ITon@it the seventh day,” since rest was created on the seventh day and all the work was completed. [At the same time, “He abstained on the seventh day,”] because rest is only an act of abstaining and not actual work. (@ITRe’m@it) Rashi’s second explanation [that the world lacked rest], raises a question: Why does it say @hb<HEB>מלאכתו@hh אשר עשה@ee<ENG> implying that Hashem did actual work? Thus Rashi gives the first explanation. And his first explanation, [that it entered by a hairbreadth,] raises a question: Why is it not written, “Elohim completed on the @ITsixth@it day”? Therefore Rashi gives both explanations. (@ITMaharshal@it) [You might ask:] How can the terms “creation” and “work” apply to rest, which is only an act of abstention [passive] and does not involve a physical action? It seems [that the answer is]: Had Hashem not added the seventh day to the days of creation, the nature of man and other creatures would be to work day and night without cease. Resting would not be part of nature, and the body of man would wear out, leaving the world empty and desolate. But by adding the seventh day, on which Hashem abstained from work and rested, it became part of the world’s nature to rest and refresh oneself, regaining strength. [Thus, it is part of creation.] (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1[3]@p2 He blessed it through the manna.<TIE>.<TIE>. but on the sixth day@p3. You might ask: Why is this a blessing? It would be a blessing if there was more on Shabbos than during the week, yet Shabbos had only an @ITomer@it per person like the other days. An answer is: The manna that fell each day was a blessing, for it is written, “and sanctified it,” [meaning] that Shabbos was sanctified and no manna fell then. Nonetheless it had the blessing of the manna, for the sixth day was doubly blessed. Thus, “He blessed it” means that the blessing was not interrupted on Shabbos. (@ITRe’m@it) @eeAn additional answer is: “He blessed it through the manna” means the manna did not spoil. On other days, leftover manna would spoil by the next day, as it is written (Shemos 16:20), “Some men left some over until morning. It became wormy and putrid.” However, if people would eat only a half @ITomer@it [on Friday], and leave an @ITomer@it and a half for Shabbos, it would not spoil. This is Shabbos’ additional blessing. (@ITMaharshal@it) @eeIt seems, [as an additional answer,] that the blessing [of Shabbos] was the manna’s increasing and sufficing for three meals, while the other days the manna yielded enough for only two meals. (@ITDivrei Dovid@it) It is amazing that in recounting the world’s Creation, it would say “blessed” and “sanctified” just because of the short time — forty years — that the manna came down. Thus it seems that this teaching means as follows: Hashem sanctified the Shabbos as a day that we may not do anything for material needs, such as work and business, nor even walk and speak in the same manner as he does during the week. Thus, due to our evil inclination which will tell us, “What shall we eat.<TIE>.<TIE>. we will not sow, and we will not gather in our produce!” (Vayikra 25:20) the Torah first tells us: “Elohim blessed the seventh day.” I.e., Hashem doubled the blessing on the sixth day so that the day of Shabbos may then be sanctified, and no work need be done. Otherwise a person might think he will lack bread, and be unable to restrain himself in the face of monetary loss. And this blessing and sanctity was not only with the manna. But each Shabbos, Hashem proclaims: “Borrow on Me [i.e., on My credit] and I will pay” (Beitzah 16b), involving blessing and sanctity. The manna was mentioned because we saw with our own eyes its great miracle of “The one who had taken less, was not lacking” (Shemos 16:18). And since there was no one to keep Shabbos at the time of Creation, for the mitzvah had not yet been given, Rashi commented, “This verse is written with reference to the future,” meaning when the Jews will keep Shabbos, not only in the time of the manna. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1@p2The work which was to have been done on Shabbos@p3. [Rashi knows this] because @hh<HEB>לעשות@ee<ENG> implies [doing in] the future. Otherwise it should have written, “Which Elohim had created and made.” @p1[4]@p2<TIE>Those mentioned previously. @p3Rashi is answering the question: Why is nothing mentioned afterwards? Thus it must refer to the previously mentioned. @p1@p2This teaches you that they were all.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., even the products of heaven and earth were created on the first day, as the verse states: “When they were created, on @ITthe day@it when Adonoy Elohim made.” You might ask: Earlier, on “Let there be lights” (1:14), Rashi wrote, “[All products of heaven and earth were created on the first day.<TIE>.<TIE>.] ‘with the heavens’ to include their products, ‘with the earth,’ to include its products.” [Why then does Rashi repeat it here?] The answer is: If not for this verse, I might think that the creation of heavens had its command, and each product of the heavens had its own command too — just as they each came to actuality on their own. Thus it is written here, “This is the history.<TIE>.<TIE>.” to teach that the products were created with the same command as the heavens. It is like wheat kernels sown on one day, and each kernel sprouts and emerges on its own, at its time. @p1@p2Another explanation of @HB<HEB>בהבראם@p1@p2<ENG>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3You might ask: Why is this “Another explanation,” a differing view? The first view did not explain the word @hh<HEB>בהבראם@ee<ENG> at all, and could thus agree with this explanation! The answer is: The first view relates @hh<HEB>בהבראם@ee<ENG> to the end of the verse, “When they were created, on the day.” But the second view relates it to the beginning of the verse, “The heavens and the earth @hh<HEB>ב@hbה@hhבראם@ee<ENG>,” implying that He created them with the letter @IThey@it. @p1@p2Here it teaches you.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 But without this verse, we would not know which world was created with @IThey,@it and which with @ITyud@it. There is a difficulty with the second view: why does it say, “On the @ITday@it when.<TIE>.<TIE>.”? Thus Rashi brought the first view. And there is a difficulty with the first view: Why does it say @hh<HEB>ב@hbה@hhבראם@ee<ENG>, with a @IThey@it? Therefore Rashi brings also the second view. That is why both explanations are needed. @p1@p2Like the @HB<HEB>ה@p2<ENG> which is closed on all sides@p3. See Menachos 29b for another reason. @p1[5]@p2 It means ‘not yet.’@p3 I.e., it stands in place of the two words @hh<HEB>עדיין לא@ee<ENG>. @p1@p2And cannot form a verb@p3. I.e., it is a noun that does not take the form of a verb. @p1@p2This verse proves this@p3. Because if it means “before,” it would be connected to the words @hh<HEB>יהיה@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>יצמח@ee<ENG> written after it [thus forming an incomplete statement], and would not explain why Hashem had not brought rain. And if it is connected to the [implied but] omitted word “this,” as if it said: “@ITBefore this@it, all the plants were upon the earth, and @ITbefore this@it,@IT @itall the vegetation sprouted,” then it does not fit with: “For Adonoy Elohim had not brought rain.” (@ITRe’m@it)<QC>
@p1@p2And another [proof]@p3. Meaning, there is another proof for this point. @p1@p2This verse, too, should be explained thus@p3. @ITRe’m@it wrote at length on this, but @ITMaharshal@it explained that Rashi means that it is impossible to explain the verse any other way, for if we say that @hh<HEB>טרם@ee<ENG> means before, how can the future tense verb @hh<HEB>תיראון@ee<ENG> be applicable to it? @p1@p2When man appeared@p3. Rashi means as follows: Hashem, who surely desires the prayers of tzaddikim, knew that man would appreciate the rain — and pray for it. See Chulin 60b. @p1@p2Adonoy is His Name@p3. His actual Name is @hh<HEB>יהוה@ee<ENG>, as it has the letters of @hh<HEB>היה הוה ויהיה@ee<ENG> (He was, He is, and He will be), and that is His Name. An alternative explanation: It is the Name signifying His essence, whereas the other names each describe one of His traits. Rashi did not explain this earlier, when it is written (v. 4): “On the day when Adonoy Elohim made.<TIE>.<TIE>.” because there it was necessary to say “Adonoy Elohim,” as Rashi explained earlier (1:1 @hh<HEB>ד"ה ברא@ee<ENG>). @p1@p2That He is Ruler and Judge@p3. I.e., Elohim means that He is All-Powerful, as it says, “The powerful ones (@hh<HEB>אילי@ee<ENG>) of the land” (Melachim II, 24:15). @p1[6]@p2 For the purpose of creating@p3. Rashi is answering the question: Earlier it is written that Hashem did not bring rain, since man had not yet been created. Why then is it written here, “A mist rose,” implying that there was rain before man was created? @p1@p2Here, too@p3. Why was Rashi forced to explain [that “a mist rose” is from the waters of the deep and] not from the waters on the surface of the earth which [evaporate and] feed the clouds? Because it is written: “For Adonoy Elohim had not brought rain,” referring to ordinary rain, from which come the waters on the earth. Thus, before man was created it did not rain. Yet “a mist rose” before man was created, for only afterwards it is written (v. 7), “Adonoy Elohim then formed the man.” If this mist was from ordinary rain, the verses would contradict each other. @p1[7]@p2 Two creations. One creation for this world, and one creation for when the dead will be resurrected. @p3This apparently means that Hashem now gives man the vitality to come back to life after death, as Hashem wills it. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1@p2He gathered dust@p3.<TIE>.<TIE>. [Rashi knows this] because if not, why does it say, “@ITDust@it <HS>from the @ITground?@it<HS>” One term is sufficient! But this explanation raises a difficulty: It should say, “From @ITall@it the earth.” Thus Rashi offers the other explanation. And the other explanation also raises a difficulty: It should say: “@hh<HEB>מֵאדמה@ee<ENG>”. Why the word @hh<HEB>מִן@ee<ENG>? Thus Rashi offered the first explanation, “From all four corners.” (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1@p2Will receive him for burial@p3. This raises a difficulty: Animals are received for burial, although their dust was never gathered! Rather, Rashi is saying that the earth receives and guards man’s body within it until the dead will be resurrected (@ITDevek Tov@it). @p1@p2If this were not so, there would be jealousy.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 This is from Vayikra Rabba. One might ask: Rest on Shabbos was created for earthly matter. Why then is there no jealousy in Creation? The answer: Rest is mainly for man, who is created from heavenly and earthly matter. Thus there is no jealousy. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1[8]@p2<TIE>East of Eden@p3. This explanation is contrary to Targum Onkelos who translates @hh<HEB>מקדם@ee<ENG> as “previously.” [Rashi rejects this] because a simple reading of the verse implies that vegetation and trees did not sprout in Gan Eden, or anywhere else, before man’s creation. Rashi added the extra words “where He planted the Garden” so we will not mistakenly explain the verse as: “To the east He placed the man He had formed.” @p1@p2Should you ask@p3. Although the question’s proper place is earlier (v. 7), on “Adonoy Elohim then formed the man,” Rashi waited to ask it until after he explained that Hashem “planted a garden in Eden @hh<HEB>מקדם@ee<ENG>, to the east.” Thus this verse describes one of the details of man’s creation, and thereby in accordance with Rashi’s answer to the above question, in which he says, “Hashem.<TIE>.<TIE>. caused the Garden of Eden to sprout for man’s benefit.” But if @hh<HEB>מקדם@ee<ENG> means “previously” [as Onkelos said,] then the Garden’s sprouting was not for man — and is not a detail of his creation. This would raise the question: Why does our verse interrupt [the story of man’s creation] to say, “Hashem planted a garden,” since He had planted it previously? Perforce, @hh<HEB>מקדם@ee<ENG> means “to the east,” as Rashi said. (@ITRe’m@it) @eeAlternatively, we can explain it the opposite way: If @hh<HEB>מקדם@ee<ENG> means “previously,” as Targum Onkelos says, then it is understandable that there it is written, “Hashem planted a garden [for him,]” right next to “Hashem formed man.” For this is in accordance with the Midrash: “@hh<HEB>וייצר@ee<ENG> with two @ITyuds@it referring to two creations: One creation for this world and one creation for the World to Come.” I.e., man was created for the pleasures of the World to Come @ITand@it for the pleasures of this world. Without the Midrash a difficulty arises: Why did He plant a garden in Eden @ITpreviously,@it if not for man’s pleasures? @eeBut now that Rashi explains @hh<HEB>מקדם@ee<ENG> means “to the east,” it teaches only about the location of man’s residence, not about the pleasures of this world. And we could say the opposite, Heaven forbid, that He created man [only] to enjoy the pleasures of this world. And the question arises: Why is “Hashem planted a garden” written next to “Hashem formed man,” and not next to the earlier verse (1:27) “Hashem created man”? To answer this question, Rashi explains: “I saw in the B’rayso of R. Eliezer.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1[9]@p2 This verse relates to the Garden.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because if it relates to the entire earth, why did Hashem not initially command the earth to bring forth “every tree that is pleasant.<TIE>.<TIE>. and good”? @p1@p2In the center of the Garden@p3. [Rashi knows this] because otherwise, why is it written “@hh<HEB>בתוך הגן@ee<ENG>”? It is already written: “Hashem made grow out of the soil every tree,” which refers to the Garden. @p1[11]@p2 Because its waters are bountiful@p3. Rashi is answering the question: Since it is the Nile, why is it not called by its wellknown name, the river of Egypt? We could erroneously think it is another river, and a land other than Egypt! Rashi answers: “Because its waters are bountiful.<TIE>.<TIE>. it is called Pishon.” I.e., it is called Pishon because this name conveys the river’s praise. And this raises the question: Why does the Torah tell us of this river’s greatness more than it tells of the other rivers’ greatness through their names? Thus Rashi explains that also the other rivers’ praise is conveyed by their names: “Gichon is so called because it flows and roars.<TIE>.<TIE>.” This explains why Rashi first comments on the names of [@ITall@it<HS>] the rivers, and only then comments on, “To the east of Ashur,” which is not according to the order appearing in the Torah. @p1[14]@p2 But the Torah writes [these names].<TIE>.<TIE>. @p3Why did Rashi not say about Pishon, regarding which it is written (v. 11), “It surrounds all the land of Chavilah,” [that the name Chavilah is based on the future]? For a man named Chavilah is mentioned [twice] in Parshas Noach (10:7, 29). The answer is: Here, Chavilah is simply the name of a territory, not named after a person. [Rashi knows this] because Pishon flows in the land of Egypt, so how could it be named after the man Chavilah [who was from a different place]? @eeFurthermore, since it is written @hh<HEB>ארץ @hbה@hhחוילה@ee<ENG>, with a modifying @hh<HEB>ה@hh@ee<ENG> it must merely be the name of a territory. And this answers the question that people ask: How does Rashi know that Kush and Ashur are based on the future? Perhaps they are simply names of territories, just like Chavilah. The answer is: If so, when they are mentioned, their names should begin with a @hh<HEB>ה@ee<ENG>, like @hh<HEB>ה@hhחוילה@ee<ENG> is written. @p1@p2On the eastern side of Ashur@p3. Rashi is saying that @hh<HEB>קדמ@hbת@ee<ENG> is like @hh<HEB>קדמ@hbה@ee<ENG> (to the east), since we often find a @hh<HEB>ת@ee<ENG> is written in place of a @hh<HEB>ה@ee<ENG>. But here it is written @hh<HEB>קדמ@hbת@ee<ENG> because it is connected to the word [following] @hh<HEB>אשור@ee<ENG>. And since it really means @hh<HEB>קדמ@hbה@ee<ENG>, it has the same meaning as if it had written @hb<HEB>ל@hhקדם@ee<ENG>, for the Torah places a @hh<HEB>ה@ee<ENG> at the end of a word that would otherwise take a @hh<HEB>ל@ee<ENG> at the beginning. Thus it has the same meaning as if it would have been written, “@ITto@it the east of Ashur.” @p1@p2The most important@p3.<TIE>.<TIE>. Rashi derived this from the fact that it is written @hh<HEB>הוא פרת@ee<ENG>. Although the word @hh<HEB>הוא@ee<ENG> is written about all the rivers, [for example] @hh<HEB>הוא הסובב@ee<ENG>, nevertheless, only for P’ras is the word @hh<HEB>הוא@ee<ENG> written next to the river’s name. (Regarding P’ras, the Torah does not say “it surrounds” or give any identifying sign. Why is P’ras different, that it needs no sign? Because of the importance of the Land of Israel!) @p1[15]@p2 He “took” him with kind words@p3. Rashi is answering the question: The word @hh<HEB>לקיחה@ee<ENG> implies [an act of acquisition,] that before the taking it was not in the taker’s possession. But everything is in Hashem’s possession! @p1@p2And persuaded him to enter@p3. Why did Rashi not explain this earlier (v. 8), on: “And there He placed (@hh<HEB>וישם@ee<ENG>) the man?” It seems the answer is: [The import of the earlier verse] is closer to the simple meaning of its words, “placed (@hh<HEB>וישם@ee<ENG>),” [thus no difficulty arises]. But the term “took” (@hh<HEB>לקיחה@ee<ENG>), in our verse, is a term that relates only to inanimate objects or animals who naturally do not possess any intellect, whereas man’s essence is his knowledge and intellect, not his physical self. “Took” cannot be applied to knowledge, because it is not a physical object. Thus [Rashi was forced here to say that it means] inducing — i.e., inducing the mind to a different thought, similar to physically “taking” and moving an object from one location to another. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1[18]@p2<TIE>If he is not worthy, then opposite him@p3. Rashi is answering the question: At first it is written “a helper.” Why then is it written @hh<HEB>כנגדו@ee<ENG>, implying she is against him, to fight him?<QC>
@p1[19]@p2 Also, it teaches you.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 This explanation [“On the day they were created.<TIE>.<TIE>.”] seems to apply only to the animals and beasts, which were created on the sixth day, [like man was]. But it does not apply to fowl which was created on the fifth day. Thus Rashi brought also the first explanation, “That the fowl were created from the swamps.” And the second explanation is to teach about the animals and beasts. @p1@p2You must transpose [the words].<TIE>.<TIE>. @p3Rashi not only inverted the verse but also added “a name” after “Adam” and “forever” after “its name.” For without the addition of “a name,” the verse would not mean that Adam called them names. Rather it would mean “he called to it,” as in (Shemos 2:20): “Call him, and let him eat bread.” Then, the phrase of “that is its name” would not be understandable, for it cannot say “that is its name” before Adam gives it a name — since he was the one who named them. And without inverting the verse, it would seem as if Adam gave the name “living creature” to everything. That is untrue, for even without him giving it this name it was already called a “living creature.” This is because the term “living creature” includes animals, beasts and fowl. Furthermore, how could it say (v. 20): “And man gave @ITnames@it to every animal,” when there is only the name of “living creature”? (@ITR’em@it) @p1[21]@p2 From his sides@p3. @hh<HEB>מסטריו@ee<ENG> means from his sides. @p1@p2This [coincides with what]@p2 we said that they were created with two faces@p3. I.e., this is true if we explain @hh<HEB>צלעותיו@ee<ENG> as “his sides.” But according to the simple meaning of the verse, @hh<HEB>צלעותיו@ee<ENG> are ribs. @p1@p2The place of the cut@p3. @ITRe’m@it writes: This follows the opinion (Eiruvin 18a) that Chavah was made from Adam’s tail. Thus nothing was missing from his body [and only the place of the cut needed to be closed]. Whereas according to the opinion that they were first created with two faces, @hh<HEB>ויסגר בשר תחתנה@ee<ENG> follows its simple meaning: Hashem filled in the missing flesh. @eeBut I would say that even according to the opinion that they were created with two faces, nothing was missing from Adam’s body. Adam and Chavah were two faces with [full] bodies, attached at the side, and only the place of the cut was missing. One might object that the above Gemara implies that @hh<HEB>ויסגר בשר תחתנה@ee<ENG> follows its simple meaning according to the opinion that they were created with two faces. Only according to the opinion that Chavah was made from Adam’s tail, does it mean “the place of the cut.” The answer is: Even according to the opinion that they were created with two faces, they were slightly fastened, [so a little flesh needed to be filled in]. (@ITMaharshal@it) @eeThe verse reads simply according to the opinion that they were created with two faces, for Adam was left without a back and his whole body cavity was open. Thus it says that Hashem “closed,” as one closes an open house or an open chest. But according to the opinion that Chavah was created from Adam’s tail, the verse reads with more difficulty — thus Rashi continued to explain that according to this opinion, it means “the place of the cut.” (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1@p2So that he not see@p3. This is from Bereishis Rabba 17:6 and Sanhedrin 39a, where Rashi explains [that “And he slept . . . and He took” was in order] that Adam should not see the piece of flesh before it was perfected. And there it is clear that this explanation follows the opinion that Chavah was made from Adam’s tail. Thus, [contrary to the order of the verse,] Rashi on this verse first explains “the place of the cut” — which also follows the opinion that Chavah was created from Adam’s tail. This was to convey that also his comment of, “So that he not see the piece of flesh” is according to the opinion that Chavah was created from Adam’s tail. @ITRe’m, @ittoo,@IT @itoffered this explanation. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1[22]@p2 So that it should become a woman@p3. Rashi is answering the question: Does @hh<HEB>ויבן את הצלע @hbל@hhאשה@ee<ENG> not imply that He built the rib @ITfor@it the woman, to be used for something, rather than implying that He formed the woman from the rib? Thus Rashi explains [that the @hh<HEB>ל@ee<ENG> of @hh<HEB>לאשה@ee<ENG> means] “@ITto become@it a woman.” Similarly in the verse Rashi cites, “And Gidon made it to an ephod” (Shoftim 8:27), it does not mean that Gidon made the material into something to be used for the ephod. Rather, he made the material into an ephod. @p1[23]@p2<TIE>This teaches@p3. @hh<HEB>בא אדם על כל בהמה וחיה@ee<ENG> does not mean intimate relations, for this expression is only a hint, while the matter itself is expressed in (4:1): “The man knew his wife, Chavah.” (@ITMaharam@it) Another answer: It means that Adam grasped with his intellect the nature of each animal and beast, for if he did not know their nature he could not have named them. @eeSome commentators, [understanding Rashi literally,] ask: How could Adam have intimate relations with the animals? He was commanded against illicit relations, and that includes relations with animals! However, this question is asked by the ill-informed. In Sanhedrin 38b it says that at the seventh hour Chavah was given to Adam as a mate, and at the ninth hour were they were commanded by Hashem. Thus, the command was given @ITafter@it pairing Chavah [with Adam]. (@ITDivrei Dovid@it) @eeAnother proof that Adam sought a mate amongst the animals is that it says: “This at last is @ITbone of my bones@it,” implying that in previous times it was not “bone of my bones.” Rashi explains quite similarly in Yevamos 63a. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1@p2From this [we derive]@p3.<TIE>.<TIE>. The proof is that @hh<HEB>איש@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>אשה@ee<ENG> have the same root. In no other language is there an etymological reason for her being called @hh<HEB>אשה@ee<ENG>. This is because only in the Holy Tongue is the word for woman derived from the word for man.<QC>
@p1[24]@p2 The Divine Spirit@p3. Rashi knows this because Adam could not have said it. Adam had no father, mother or children at that time, so what brought him to say it? @p1@p2Prohibiting to the “sons of Noach.” @p3As it says, “He shall cling to his wife,” and not to his fellow’s wife. The prohibition on illicit relations is derived from this verse, as if it said: “Therefore, a man shall leave his father’s wife and his mother and he may not have relations with them.” (@ITRe’m@it) @eeYou might ask: What difference does it make that the Divine Spirit said it? [The answer is:] So you will not think that the verse is stating that this is the nature of things [and it is not a commandment]. For if so, it should say @hh<HEB>עוזב@ee<ENG> (“leaves”) rather than @hh<HEB>יעזוב@ee<ENG> (“shall leave”). (@ITMaharshal@it) @eeThe implication of “therefore” could be explained as follows: Since I did a great kindness for Adam by forming the woman for him, [it is only right that I may make] a condition: that Adam refrain from engaging in forbidden relations. Similarly, Hashem says to Israel (Shemos 20:2): “I, Who brought you out of the land of Egypt,” implying that I brought you out on condition: that you fulfill the mitzvos. (@ITNachalas@it @ITYaakov@it) @p1@p2The child is formed@p3. In other words, the verse prohibits relations with animals, who do not form a child after relations with humans. (@ITRe’m@it) @eeIt seems that according to Rashi, the verse is giving a reason for the forbidden relations: so that there be no illicit children. True, such relations are forbidden even with women too young or old to give birth, and with animals who do not conceive from humans. Nevertheless, the prohibition becomes more noticeable and visible when it produces an illicit child, a wrong that cannot be corrected. @p1[25]@p2 They did not.<TIE>.<TIE>. @p3It means that they did not know of modest conduct at all. Not from lack of wisdom, but because they did not need to know, for they had no evil inclination. (@ITTzeidah@it @ITL’Derech@it)  @p1[1]@p2 Why is this incident inserted here@p3? @ITRe’m@it asks: How does Rashi know that the coats were made right at Adam and Chavah’s creation, to protect from cold and heat, giving rise to the question: “Why is this incident inserted here?” Perhaps the coats were made only after they sinned by eating from the tree, to cover their shame of being naked! This way, the verses are in proper sequence [and Rashi’s question does not arise]. It seems that Rashi knew it because it is written (v. 20), “The man called his wife’s name Chavah,” and subsequently, (v. 21) “And Hashem Elokim made for Adam and his wife leather coats.” Rashi explains that this verse “And man gave names.<TIE>.<TIE>.,” returns to the earlier narrative. As the naming of Chavah was before the sin, and is connected to “And Hashem made.<TIE>.<TIE>. leather coats,” we can conclude that right at their creation Hashem made them coats [to protect from cold and heat]. Thus, the coats were not made to cover their shame after they sinned. An alternative answer is: [Rashi knew it] because it is written, “Hashem made.<TIE>.<TIE>. leather coats and @ITHe@it clothed them.” Why, because they sinned, would Hashem have to clothe them Himself?! They should clothe themselves, just as they made for themselves loincloths. It should have written, “Hashem made.<TIE>.<TIE>. leather coats @ITfor clothing@it.” Perforce, Hashem made them coats right at their creation to protect from cold and heat. @ITRe’m@it asks: [If they had coats from the beginning,] why were they “naked” (v. 25)? The answer is: According to the opinion (Bereishis Rabba 20:12) that @hh<HEB>כתנות עור@ee<ENG> means fingernail-like garments, smooth [and transparent], which cleaved to their skin, they were as naked. Although it was attached to their skin, their entire body was revealed, including the loins. And even according to the opinion (ibid) that the garments were of rabbit fur, to protect from cold and heat, still they were naked — for Adam was created in Tishrei (according to Rabbi Eliezer), or in Nisan (according to Rabbi Yehoshua), when it is neither cold nor hot; [thus they were not dressed.] They were not embarrassed to be naked since they did not yet eat from the tree. The serpent “saw them unclothed, indulging in marital relations unashamedly, and he coveted her.” We need not ask: If so, why did they take fig leaves to make loincloths? They should have worn the coats! [The answer is:] Indeed they could have. But just then the coats were not available to them and they did not want to stand naked for even a moment. In any case, this point [of when the garments were created] seems to be disputed. For it says in Pesachim 54a: “Ten things were created at twilight on Erev Shabbos.<TIE>.<TIE>. and some say: ‘Also Adam’s garments.’” The second view holds that the garments were created @ITafter@it they sinned, for they sinned in the tenth hour of the day, which is before twilight. But the first view could hold that the garments were created before the sin. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1@p2Indulging in marital relations@p3. You might ask: Where does the verse allude to marital relations? The answer is: The verse could just say, “The two of them were naked.” Why does it add, “The man and his wife”? This implies that besides being naked, they acted as man and wife. (@ITAb’a@it) @p1@p2More cunning@p3.<TIE>.<TIE>. Rashi is answering the question: Why does it say, “More.<TIE>.<TIE>. than any”? Because being “More cunning than any” led to becoming “More cursed than any.” @p1@p2Did He perhaps tell@p3. [Rashi explained @hh<HEB>אף@ee<ENG> as “perhaps”] because it cannot mean “even more so,” coming as it does at the beginning of the serpent’s statement. @p1@p2And, although he saw them.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 The Torah does not recount [that he saw them eat], but it must be so: otherwise, what did they eat? (@ITRe’m@it) @eeBut this is no proof — perhaps they ate herbs and legumes! Rather, Rashi knows [that he saw them eat] because the serpent said, “You should not eat from @ITall@it the trees of the Garden?” If he saw that they were eating only herbs and legumes, he should have said simply, “You should not eat from the @ITtrees@it of the Garden?” Since he said “@ITall@it the trees,” he must have seen them eating other fruits. But he saw them eating sporadically: they would eat figs but not grapes, and then eat from another nearby tree. Since he saw them eating some fruits and leaving others, there was room for his question: Are you doing this out of choice, because the other fruits are not as good, or is it because Hashem commanded you not to eat from all the trees of the Garden — and therefore you eat only some of them?<QC>
@p1[4]@p2 He pushed her@p3.<TIE>.<TIE>. If it were not so, why did she believe him when he said, “You certainly will not die,” and not contradict him? @p1@p2So. too, there is no death in eating@p3. This [the serpent’s argument] is puzzling: she might still die, for Hashem said, “On the @ITday@it you eat from it you will certainly die,” and there is plenty of time left in the day! Another question: If [she thought] they would die for touching, then it goes without saying for eating. For one cannot eat without touching. If so, why does she [mention both and] say, “You shall not @ITeat@it from it, neither shall you @ITtouch@it it”? It seems the answer is: [She thought that] for eating from it they would die, and for touching it they would fall sick immediately, and then grow more sick until they would die on that same day. When she saw that she did not fall sick from touching it, [she thought that] she surely would not die either. @eeSome ask: What did the serpent prove by making her touch the tree and not die? In truth she was forbidden only on eating, not on touching, and she knew this herself! Why was she not afraid for her life [to eat]? Furthermore, why did she add to Hashem’s command? @eeThe answer is: The command was made to Adam, not to Chavah. But when Adam taught it to Chavah he warned her not to touch it either, for he knew that women are light-minded. Whereas she thought that Hashem actually forbade touching. Although Rashi says that @ITshe@it added, and in fact she added nothing to what Adam had told her in Hashem’s Name, nonetheless she should not have replied to the serpent more than what he asked her. [And in this way, she added.] He asked only about eating, not about touching! So when she saw that she did not die from touching — which she should have, according to her understanding of her husband’s command — she took of its fruit as well and ate. And some ask further: How does touching prove that for eating [she will not die]? She was forced to touch, since he pushed her. But she will eat willingly! The answer is: She thought that the tree was like a deadly poison. Anyone who eats from it will die, similar to the Tree of Life whose very fruit bestows life. Thus she said, “Neither shall you touch it.” She considered it like a very potent poison which, as is known, can be lethal upon touch. So the serpent pushed her and told her, “Just as there is no death in touching.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (@ITsource unknown@it) @eeThere is a famous question: Why did Chavah fool herself? She knew that she herself added the prohibition against touching, and that is why she did not die! The answer is: Chavah understood that Hashem’s prohibition against eating also included touching. This is similar to the verse (Vayikra 12:4), “She shall not @ITtouch@it anything holy,” which means, “She shall not @ITeat@it.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1[5]@p2 Every craftsman.<TIE>.<TIE>. @p3Rashi is answering the question: On the contrary, why did Hashem not feed them the fruit so they will become wise and know of good and evil? Rashi answers: “Every craftsman resents his fellowcraftsman.” @p1[6]@p2 She “saw”.<TIE>.<TIE>. @p3Rashi is answering the question: What did she see now that she did not see before, as she did not yet eat from the tree? [The answer is: Here,] “seeing” means “contemplating.” @p1@p2To be.<TIE>.<TIE>. @p3You might ask: Why does Rashi not interpret [the phrases of our verse] in the same order that the serpent spoke to her? First he said, “Your eyes will open,” and then, “To be like a god.” The answer is: Since in the second phrase it is clearly written: “Tempting to the @ITeyes,@it” this must refer to: “Your @ITeyes@it will open.” And “Appealing as a means of @ITwisdom@it” clearly refers to: “@ITKnowers@it of good and evil.” Perforce, “The tree was good for food” refers to, “To be like a god.” @p1@p2So that she will not die.<TIE>.<TIE>. @p3Rashi knows this because it is written, “with her”. @p1@p2Comes to include animal and beast@p3. [Rashi knows this] because otherwise, why was death imposed upon the animals? But her intention was not that they should die. @p1[7]@p2 Refers to wisdom.<TIE>.<TIE>. @p3I.e., the wisdom is that of knowing. Now they @ITknew@it what they had lost — the mitzvah of not eating from the Tree of Knowledge. (@ITRe’m@it) It seems that this is referring to the wisdom of distinguishing between good and evil, as Rashi wrote earlier (2:25) that although Adam had the wisdom to give names, he did not have an evil inclination [and could not distinguish between good and evil] until he ate from the tree. When Rashi says, “As evidenced by the end of the verse,” he means that it does not say, “And they @ITsaw@it they were naked,” rather, “they @ITknew@it.” I.e., they acquired knowledge. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it)<QC>
@p1@p2That is the tree@p3.<TIE>.<TIE>. Rashi knows this because it is written: “@ITFig@it leaves,” when the Torah could simply have written: “They sewed together leaves.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Rashi is also answering the question: Why did Adam take leaves from the tree he sinned with? He should have taken them from a different tree, so people will not know with which tree he sinned! For it is wrong to publicize the way in which one sinned, as it says in Berachos 34b: “It is impudent to publicize one’s sin.” Rashi answers: “The other trees prevented them.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1@p2Why is the name of the tree not@p3.<TIE>.<TIE>. Rashi means: Since it is written, “They sewed together @ITfig@it leaves,” in order to tell us with what he sinned, why does it not state expressly which tree it was? Why only allude to it? @p1[8]@p2 As He was walking@p3. [The verse says only @hh<HEB>מתהלך@ee<ENG> but] Rashi added the word @hh<HEB>היה@ee<ENG> before it, since otherwise it is present tense, [whereas past tense is called for]. And Rashi added also a @hh<HEB>ש@ee<ENG>, @hh<HEB>ש@hhהיה@ee<ENG>, since @hh<HEB>מתהלך@ee<ENG> calls for a @hh<HEB>ש@ee<ENG>. (@ITRe’m@it) The reason [that Hashem was walking through the Garden] is: Hashem did not want to punish him hastily, but after deliberation, as it says in Avos 1:1, “Be slow and deliberate in judgment.” (@ITDivrei Dovid@it) @p1[9]@p2 He knew.<TIE>.<TIE>. that he not be bewildered@p3. In other words, Hashem wanted him to say, “I have sinned,” and repent in his heart. For Hashem wants [the wicked] to repent, not that they die. You might ask: Here Rashi says that Hashem spoke to Bilam for a similar reason. So why does Rashi explain in Parshas Balak that Hashem’s intent was to mislead him? The answer is: There as well, Hashem wished to enter into conversation, but [with a different intent:] He increased His speech with Bilam and said, “Who are these people with you?” to mislead him. (@ITRe’m@it) @p1[11]@p2 From where@p3.<TIE>.<TIE>. You might ask: Why did Rashi not explain as he did earlier (v. 7), that [“naked’ means that] Adam was stripped of the command? The answer is: Hashem’s question, “Who told you that you are naked?” related to Adam’s statement of, “I was afraid because I was naked.” Adam’s nakedness caused his fear. And he could not mean “stripped of the command,” [i.e., that the command was no longer relevant to him,] since a man who has no command need not fear. A man must fulfill only what he is commanded, and will not be punished for transgressing what he has not been commanded! And if Adam was afraid because he transgressed his [original] command, he should have said clearly: “I was afraid because I transgressed the command.” Thus Rashi explains it here as the shame of being unclothed. Another answer is: The verse cannot mean, “Who told you that you are stripped of the command?” since Adam obviously was aware that he had transgressed. (@ITRe’m@it) @eeI heard a different explanation. The verse should be read: “Who told you, ‘Are you naked?’” In other words, Hashem is saying: I did not ask why you are naked, so why do you answer Me about more than what I had asked? When I said, “Where are you?” I was only asking whether you sinned by eating from the tree! (@ITTzeidah L’Derech@it) @p1@p2With wonder@p3. [Rashi knows this] because otherwise Adam should have simply answered, “Yes” to Hashem’s question. But since the question expressed wonder and astonishment, Adam responded to this by saying, “The woman.<TIE>.<TIE>. gave me of the tree and I ate.” @p1[14]@p2<TIE>From here. @p3You might ask: Why cannot every @hh<HEB>מסית@ee<ENG> exonerate himself with this claim? The answer is: The serpent was not forbidden to entice others to sin. He was punished only because of the sin that the @ITothers@it committed, due to him. Thus he could answer, “The words of the master.<TIE>.<TIE>.” But a @hh<HEB>מסית@ee<ENG> who is forbidden by the Torah to entice others to sin is transgressing Hashem’s command. This helps to answer @ITRe’m’s@it question. (@ITFrom my father’s manuscript. And Maharshal is quoted as saying the same.@it) @eeYou might ask: [Why was the serpent called a @hh<HEB>מסית@ee<ENG>?] It is stated in Sanhedrin 67a that a @hh<HEB>מסית@ee<ENG> is only someone who incites to idolatry! The answer is: The serpent said to Chavah, “You will become as gods,” — this is idolatry. (@ITChizkuni@it) @p1@p2If he was cursed more than the animal@p3.<TIE>.<TIE>. [The curse refers to] the length of the serpent’s gestation period, that it be longer than the gestation period of domesticated animals. The gestation period of domesticated animals is longer than the gestation period of wild beasts. @p1@p2The gestation period of a snake [lasts]@p2 seven years@p3. The calculation is as follows: The gestation period of a [wild] cat is fifty-two days, and that of a [domesticated] donkey is one year. Thus, animals are cursed seven times more than beasts [7 x 52 days = 364 days.] Thus the snake, was cursed seven times more than animals, and has a gestation period of seven years. But “From all the beasts” cannot mean more than a lion or viper, whose gestation is three years and seventy years, for if so the Torah should have written: “From all the beasts,” and not mention, “From all the animals.” [Since it mentions both, it means as explained.] (@ITRe’m@it)<QC>
@p1@p2He had legs@p3.<TIE>.<TIE>. For if he never had legs, why is crawling on his belly a curse? (@ITRe’m@it) @p1[15]@p2 Your intention@p3.<TIE>.<TIE>. You might ask: Why was the serpent not concerned that Chavah would eat first, as he gave to her first? The answer is: The way of women is to honor their husbands by giving to them first, so the serpent reasoned that Chavah would do so — and once she sees him die, she will not eat! Alternatively, the serpent thought he would stop her from eating. Another answer: The serpent reasoned that Adam, who was commanded not to eat from the tree, would die. But the woman was not commanded, and would not die even if she ate. For it was to Adam that Hashem said: “But from the Tree of Knowledge.<TIE>.<TIE>. you shall not eat.” @p1@p2And you would marry Chavah@p3. [Rashi knows this] because “I will put hostility” implies that Hashem was punishing the serpent for loving her.<QC>
@p1@p2You will be unable to@p3.<TIE>.<TIE>. We could say that Rashi is answering the question: Hashem cursed man separately. So why is man’s curse mixed here with the serpent’s curse? Rashi answers: It is entirely the serpent’s curse and disgrace, as it conveys that the serpent will be unable to stand upright. But @ITRe’m@it explains that [Rashi is answering the question:] Why is, “And you [the serpent] shall strike him.<TIE>.<TIE>.” mentioned in the serpent’s curse? It is no curse! [Rashi answers that it conveys, “You will be unable to stand upright.”] And this point cannot be learned from, “On your belly you shall crawl,” since that teaches merely that his legs were cut off — but if he wanted to stand upright, perhaps he could. Thus the Torah says: “You shall strike him on the heel,” [to convey that he cannot stand upright]. @p1@p2But, even from there.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: It is written, “He shall strike you on the head, and you shall strike him on the heel,” implying that the only difference between man and snake is where they strike. What about the other difference? The man kills the snake but the snake does not kill the man! Therefore Rashi explains, “Even from there you will kill him.” (@ITRe’m@it) Alternatively, Rashi is answering the question: It is written, “He shall strike you on the head,” i.e., a blow which surely kills. And then it is written, “You shall strike him on the heel,” using the same word. But if the snake strikes the man’s heel, he will not die. Why does the same word connote death here, but not there? Thus Rashi explains, “Even from there you will kill him.” @p1@p2The form @HB<HEB>נשיפה@p1@p2<ENG> is used@p3. Rashi is answering the question: Why does it not say expressly, “You shall bite him (@hh<HEB>תשכנו@ee<ENG>)”? (@ITGur Aryeh@it) But @ITRe’m@it explains: @hh<HEB>ישופך@ee<ENG> is an expression that connotes crushing [a blow] to the [snake’s] head. However, @hh<HEB>תשופנו@ee<ENG> is an expression that connotes the hissing of a snake. Nevertheless, for the sake of eloquence, the Torah often equates words [that sound alike] even though their meanings differ. @p1[16]@p2<TIE>The pain of rearing children@p3. Why was she cursed first with the pain of rearing children and then with the pain of pregnancy, which is chronologically out of sequence? Because at that time, they [already] had children, as it says in Sanhedrin 38b: “Two people entered the bed, and four left it.” And it says (4:1), “The man knew his wife,” on which Rashi comments: “This had already occurred before the previous narrative.” (See @ITDivrei Dovid@it) @p1@p2You will not have the audacity@p3.<TIE>.<TIE>. Although the Gemara calls this a praiseworthy trait for women, we could say that this means she is praiseworthy for not transgressing Hashem’s command, as she was cursed by Hashem not to demand relations. (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1@p2All will come from him and not from you@p3. Why does Rashi explain at such length, when he already said, “You will not have the audacity.<TIE>.<TIE>.”? It is to say that @ITall@it depends on the husband. If she does not want [relations] and he does, he can compel her. But if he does not want and she does, she cannot compel him. Thus Rashi explained: “All [the initiative] will come from him and not from you.”<QC>
@p1[17]@p2 Comparable to one who adopts@p3.<TIE>.<TIE>. The text of Rashi should read: “@ITA second explanation@it: This is comparable to one who adopts evil ways.<TIE>.<TIE>.” [This correction must be made] because the first view holds that the curse was on @ITman@it, by means of the soil, whereas the analogy conveys that the curse was on the @ITsoil@it, since man was created from it. A question arises: Here Rashi says that the earth was cursed because of [man’s sin], but earlier (1:11) Rashi said that it was because the earth disobeyed Hashem’s command. The answer is: Both sins caused the earth to be cursed. (If for its own sin alone, the earth would be cursed to give one-third of its regular produce. But [the curse of] thorns and thistles were for both their sins.) (@ITDevek Tov@it)<QC>
@p1[18]@p2 Kundes and thistles@p3. The @ITAruch@it explains that these are bitter vegetables which are prepared [i.e., made edible] by stewing. And @ITkundes@it is called @ITkardi@it. @p1@p2Which require special preparation to be eaten@p3. Rashi says this because afterwards it says, “And you will eat the herbs of the field.” I.e., you will have to subsist on these, since whatever seeds you sow, only these will sprout. Thus we must say that these are edible after preparation. The verse cannot not mean thorns and thistles exclusively, for it is written afterwards, “And you will eat the @ITherbs@it of the field.” [How are there herbs,] if only thorns and thistles@IT @itsprout? @p1@p2Does it not state in his blessing@p3.<TIE>.<TIE>. In the blessing it is written (1:29): “I have given you all seed-yielding herbs,” which are food for man. But here it says, “You will eat the herbs@IT of the field@it.” I.e., even if you sow your garden with legumes and vegetables — food for man — it will sprout for you herbs of the field which are animal fodder. And you will be forced to eat them. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1[19]@p2 After you will toil@p3.<TIE>.<TIE>. It does not mean that you will eat bread mixed with sweat. @p1[20]@p2 A play on the word @HB<HEB>חיה@p1@p2<ENG> [alive]. @p3Rashi is answering the question: Why did he not name her @hh<HEB>חיה@ee<ENG>? Thus he explained, “A play on the word.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1[21]@p2 Smooth@p3. @hh<HEB>חלקים@ee<ENG> is from the same root as @hh<HEB>חלוק@ee<ENG>, robe. In other words, cloaks of fingernail-like material cleaving to their skin.<QC>
@p1[22]@p2 He is unique in the terrestrial as I am unique in the celestial. @p3@ITRe’m@it raised a difficulty with this, but it seems that Rashi is saying: Hashem is unique in heaven, for His knowledge includes all: intellect, knowledge (to distinguish between true and false), and knowledge of good and evil (to distinguish between proper and improper). So too with man on earth: his intellect, coming from heaven, enables him to distinguish between true and false, and by eating from the Tree of Knowledge enables him to distinguish between proper and improper. But animals and beasts, although they ate from the Tree of Knowledge, cannot distinguish between right and wrong — only between beneficial and harmful, as they flee from harm and pursue what is beneficial. Thus, man is unique on earth as Hashem is in heaven, for the angels cannot distinguish between right and wrong, only between true and false. Therefore, Adam “must be prevented from reaching out his hand,” as he is “likely to lead people astray after him.” @p1@p2If he would live forever@p3.<TIE>.<TIE>. [You might ask:] Once Adam was given a mate why would people claim that he is a god, according to what Rashi explained on (2:18), “It is not good for the man to be alone”? The answer is: If he had no mate, people would err on their own. But with a mate, he could still mislead people, since he has the knowledge of good and evil and lives forever. (@ITNachalas@it @ITYaakov@it) @p1[24]@p2 To the east of Gan Eden. @p3The @hh<HEB>מ@ee<ENG> of @hh<HEB>מקדם@ee<ENG> causes it to mean “to the eastern side.” Thus it means, “To the east of Gan Eden.” And “Outside the Garden” means that the Cherubim themselves were outside the Garden. If they were inside the Garden, on its eastern side, man could enter the Garden until he came close to them. Since they were outside of the Garden, he could not enter at all. @p1@p2Which had sharpness, to frighten him@p3. @hh<HEB>להט@ee<ENG> means a shiny appearance. Since this appearance cannot exist without a sword, Rashi says, “The rotating sword” — which had @hh<HEB>להט@ee<ENG>. As if it stated, “A rotating sword which has a @hh<HEB>להט@ee<ENG> appearance when it rotates.” @p1[1]@p2 This.<TIE>.<TIE>. before he sinned. @p3Rashi is answering the question: It should have been written @hh<HEB>וַיֵדַע@ee<ENG> [rather than @hh<HEB>יָדַע@ee<ENG>]. @p1@p2Children were born to him@p3. Rashi used the expression “children were born to him” rather than “he knew his wife” because otherwise Rashi would be implying that Adam knew her only after he was exiled, not before. [And this is not true,] for earlier, on the verse of “This at last is bone of my bones.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (2:23), Rashi says: “Adam attempted to find a mate amongst all the animals.<TIE>.<TIE>. until he discovered Chavah.” This implies that Adam had relations with Chavah at that point. This answers another question: How does Rashi know that Adam’s “knowing his wife” before he was exiled included conception and birth as well? Perhaps it was referring only to relations. The answer is: “This at last is bone of my bones.<TIE>.<TIE>.” already taught us that Adam had relations. Thus, the verse “The man knew his wife.<TIE>.<TIE>.” perforce [includes conception and birth]. @p1@p2With Hashem@p3. This comment is out of sequence, because Rashi did not wish to state that the word @hh<HEB>את@ee<ENG> “implies additional facts or things” before he explained @hh<HEB>את ה'@ee<ENG>, [which is understood differently]. Once he explained that @hh<HEB>את ה'@ee<ENG> means “with Hashem,” rather than “implying additional facts or things,” he can then state: “The word @hh<HEB>את@ee<ENG> is repeated thrice, to expound additional facts or things.” (@ITDivrei Dovid@it) @p1@p2We are co-partners with Him@p3. For there are three partners in [the formation of] a person: Hashem, the person’s father, and the person’s mother. (@ITNidah@it 31a) @p1@p2Consequently, it says: “And she increased.” @p3In other words, it means, that “she increased an @hh<HEB>את@ee<ENG>.” This is because two instances of @hh<HEB>את@ee<ENG> imply two additional children. This fully explains why the word @hh<HEB>ותוסף@ee<ENG> is written. @p1[2]@p2 Because the earth was cursed@p3.<TIE>.<TIE>. Rashi is answering the question: Why was Hevel a shepherd? Since they were not allowed to slaughter any creature, what benefit could be derived from this? [This is not true,] for he could benefit from the butter, cheese, milk and wool, which were permitted to them. @p1[3]@p2 From the worst@p3. Rashi is answering the question: Why did the Torah not write, “From the first fruits of the soil,” as it writes for Hevel: “From the firstborn of his flock, from the best thereof.” @p1@p2That it was linseed@p3. [How does Rashi know this?] Because it is the answer to the question: Why does it say, “@ITFruit@it of the @ITsoil@it?” It should say either “From the soil,” [i.e., a vegetable], or “Fruit of the tree.” [The answer is:] Kayin brought a “fruit” that was like [a vegetable of] the soil. For it says in Berachos 40a that if a plant that does not produce fruit from its branch a second time, it is called [a vegetable of] the soil. And flax plants do not produce fruit from their stalks a second time. Yet flax is also called a tree, as it says (Yehoshua 2:6), “And she hid them with the stalks of @ITflax trees@it.” Thus, “@ITFruit@it of the @ITsoil@it” must refer to linseed, which is of the soil, yet called a tree. (@ITMaharshal@it) @eeAn Aggadah explains that “the worst” refers to linseed, as it says in Bava Basra 92a: “One who sells fruit to his friend and it did not sprout, @ITeven@it if it was linseed.<TIE>.<TIE>.” The Gemara did not mention any seed [other than linseed as the example], because it is the most inferior of foods. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it)<QC>
@p1[4]@p2 And he turned.<TIE>.<TIE>. Do not turn (@HB<HEB>אל ישעו@p1@p2<ENG>)@p3. Many are puzzled by this, as Rashi himself says in Parshas Shemos 5:9 that the @hh<HEB>אל ישעו@ee<ENG> written there does not mean “Do not turn,” [rather, “Do not talk”], and is unlike @hh<HEB>לא שעה@ee<ENG> written here! It seems the answer is: @hh<HEB>לא שעה@ee<ENG>, [whose basic meaning is “to disregard”], is an expression [that can connote disregard] in a broad sense and in a limited sense. There are two ways of [disregarding a] matter: 1. To not even to speak of it. 2. To speak as one wishes but refrain from action. This answers the question. For in Shemos, @hh<HEB>אל ישעו@ee<ENG> also means “to disregard.” But Pharaoh did not mean in the narrow sense, refraining only from action, as @hh<HEB>לא שעה@ee<ENG> means here. That is why the Torah writes there @hb<HEB>ב@hhדברי שקר@ee<ENG>, rather than @hb<HEB>אל@hh דברי שקר@ee<ENG>, as Rashi points out there — to indicate that @hh<HEB>אל ישעו בדברי שקר@ee<ENG> means even in speech. Therefore it is fine that Rashi here explains the @hh<HEB>אל ישעו@ee<ENG> of Shemos as disregarding, for that indeed is what it means, [but in the broad sense]. Rashi in Shemos is saying that @hh<HEB>אל ישעו@ee<ENG> cannot mean the same as the @hh<HEB>וישע אל הבל@ee<ENG> of Bereishis — which was in action alone. That is why there, Rashi was careful to say that @hh<HEB>אל ישעו@ee<ENG> means, “Let them not.<TIE>.<TIE>. even talk,” to convey that even talking is included. (@ITDivrei Dovid@it) @p1@p2A fire descended and consumed his gift-offering@p3. Rashi is answering the question: How did Hevel know that Hashem paid regard to him? The answer is: “A fire descended.<TIE>.<TIE>.”<QC>
@p1[7]@p2Your grave@p3. Rashi is answering the question: Why does it say, “At the opening?” [The judgment of] being sentenced to Gehinom has no “opening”! Thus Rashi explains, [it refers to] “The opening of your grave,” i.e., the pain of being put in the grave.<QC>
@p1[8]@p2 He engaged him in argument and dispute. @p3Rashi is answering the question: Why does the verse not explain what Kayin said? It must be that “he engaged him in argument.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (@ITDevek@it @ITTov@it) In Bereishis Rabbah (22:7) it explains that Kayin the soilworker would argue that the soil belongs to him, thus Hevel the shepherd had no place in the world. Kayin would not allow him to graze his flocks. This caused a dispute. @p1[9]@p2 So that he may repent@p3.<TIE>.<TIE>. Why did Rashi not say the same regarding Adam? The answer is: By hiding himself, Adam admitted that he had sinned. Thus Rashi could not say, “He may repent and say: ‘I sinned.’” Another answer: Adam was a great tzaddik, as he was created by Hashem Himself. Surely he will admit his sin! Not so concerning Kayin. Therefore, Hashem had to “engage him in conversation so that he may repent.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1@p2He became a deceiver@p3.<TIE>.<TIE>. Kayin thought that Hashem is not All-Knowing; otherwise he would not have tried to deny [that he had sinned]. @p1[10]@p2 For he did not know@p3.<TIE>.<TIE>. This is from Sanhedrin 37b, which goes on to say: “Until he reached his neck.” @p1[11]@p2 Even more@p3.<TIE>.<TIE>. This refers to the ground’s sin of bringing forth [inedible] trees bearing fruit; when Adam was cursed, so too was the ground. It does not refer to the ground’s sin of opening its mouth. For about that sin it cannot be said, “You are cursed more than the curse of the ground,” as the ground had not yet been cursed for it. @p1@p2It continued to sin@p3. Rashi apparently holds that the term @hh<HEB>פצתה@ee<ENG> means to open extra wide, which was the [ground’s] sin, as Tosafos says (Sanhedrin 37b @hh<HEB>ד"ה מיום@ee<ENG>): “It left no trace [of Hevel’s blood] at all.” (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @ITRe’m@it asks: Here, it was considered bad for the ground to open its mouth. So why does it say in Sanhedrin 37b: “From the day the ground opened to accept Hevel’s blood it has not opened [again] for the good”? This implies that opening its mouth was good! However, I do not understand what the question is. Surely it was good for Kayin that Hevel’s blood be covered, but for Hevel it was bad [that the ground opened and covered his blood] because as long as Hevel’s blood remains visible, his death would be avenged — as was the case with the blood of Zechariah the prophet (see Gittin 57b). (@ITDivrei Dovid@it) @p1[13]@p2<TIE>An incredulous question@p3. This is a question, although it lacks the @hh<HEB>ה@ee<ENG> which would indicate this. It cannot be a statement, with Kayin saying that his sin is unforgivable and more than he can bear, for Kayin would then be magnifying his sin. How could he then [contest his punishment and] say, “Behold, today You have banished me.<TIE>.<TIE>.” if he already admitted that his sin is deserving of it? (@ITRe’m@it) @eeQuestion: What does Hashem’s bearing of the worlds have to do with His bearing of Kayin’s sin? It seems the answer is: Kayin is saying that earthly creatures surely sin, as it says (8:21), “For the inclination of man’s heart is evil from his youth.” Why did You, Hashem, create them? It must be that repentance can rectify their sins. If so, “You cannot manage to bear my sin?” (@ITDivrei Dovid@it) @p1@p2“And you cannot manage to bear my sin?” @p3This may be understood according to (Tehillim 130:4): “Forgiveness is with You, in order that You be feared.” “Forgiveness is with You” — nothing stops You [from forgiving sin]. “In order that You be feared” — [this forgiveness increases fear of Hashem]. But a human king cannot grant pardon beyond the rules of protocol. Thus a transgressor [against him] thinks, “I am surely lost!” and therefore he will continue to sin more. [However, Hashem’s forgiveness holds man back from further sin.] Accordingly, Kayin said: “You bear the worlds. Everything is Yours and no one holds You back [from forgiving]. Why can You not bear my sin? People will say that You are unable to forgive beyond the rules of protocol, Heaven forbid!” (@ITTzeidah L’Derech@it, citing @ITMaharshal@it)<QC>
@p1[15]@p2 “I do not wish.<TIE>.<TIE>. I will take my vengeance@p3. The sevenfold vengeance is not referring to the killer of Kayin. For Lemech killed Kayin — and revenge was not taken on him to be killed after seven generations! Rather, “Whoever kills Kayin.<TIE>.<TIE>.” serves as a threat [that no creature injure Kayin], while “Revenge will be taken on him sevenfold” refers to Kayin’s own punishment. Thus, Hevel’s revenge from Kayin will come only after seven generations. This is seen from the end of the verse, “Revenge will be taken on him sevenfold,” that it pertains to Kayin and not to Kayin’s killer. (@ITRe’m@it) Another reason why this verse cannot mean that sevenfold revenge will be taken on Kayin’s killer: why should Kayin’s killer be different from other killers, to have his punishment delayed seven generations? Perforce, “Revenge will be taken on him sevenfold” is a separate point — that Hashem will take revenge from Kayin after seven generations, [due to Kayin’s claim, “You cannot manage to bear my sin?”] Consequently, “This is one of those verses in which words are brief.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1@p2The verse speaks by hinting@p3. It means that here, the verse speaks by hinting, but in another place it is spelled out: He who kills these, “He shall be a leader and general.” @p1@p2And the blind@p3. The “blind” and the “lame” were idolatrous images. The “lame” corresponded to Yaakov [who limped on his thigh], and the “blind” corresponded to Yitzchak [whose eyes dimmed]. Upon these idols was written the oath Avraham swore to Avimelech that they would not wage war against one another. However, in David’s time the oath had been voided. @p1@p2He inscribed a letter from His Name@p3. It means a letter from Kayin’s name, the letter @hh<HEB>ת@ee<ENG>, which hints: “With this, @hb<HEB>ת@hhחיה@ee<ENG> (you shall live).” I.e., none shall kill him. [@hh<HEB>ת@ee<ENG> is a letter from Kayin’s name because his mother named him (4:1): “I have obtained (@hh<HEB>קני@hbת@hhי@ee<ENG>) a man with Adonoy”]. Alternatively, it means a letter from Hashem’s Name, the letter @hh<HEB>ה@ee<ENG>, which hints: “Therefore, whoever kills (@hb<HEB>ה@hhורג@ee<ENG>) Kayin.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1[16]@p2 He exited with humility.<TIE>.<TIE>. a deceiver@p3.<TIE>.<TIE>. Rashi knows this because the Torah uses the term @hh<HEB>ויצא@ee<ENG> (exited), which means leaving an enclosed area, instead of @hh<HEB>וילך@ee<ENG> (went). But Kayin ‘exited’ from the Presence of Hashem, for Whom there is no enclosed area, as the whole earth is filled with His Glory! [Thus it hints, “He exited with humility.”] @p1@p2Which indicates that Adam was there@p3.<TIE>.<TIE>. For if not, why were the angels in the east and not elsewhere? @p1@p2An alternative explanation of @HB<HEB>בארץ נוד@p1@p2<ENG>. @p3But the verse cannot mean only this explanation, for otherwise, why does it say: “East of Eden”? Thus we need the first explanation, “That is where his father was exiled.” And the verse cannot mean only that explanation, for otherwise, why does it say: “In the land of Nod,” instead of, “In the territory”? [Thus Rashi offered both explanations.] (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1[17]@p2 Kayin was building. @p3Rashi is explaining that Kayin is the one who “was building a city,” not Chanoch although his name is mentioned immediately before. Otherwise, why would it say: “He named the city after his son Chanoch”?<QC>
@p1[19]@p2 It would not be necessary to detail.<TIE>.<TIE>. @p3It could have just said: “Mesushael had a son Lemech, and Lemech had a son Yuval.” Why is it written, “Lemech married two women”? @p1@p2The one intended for conjugal relations@p3. She was given a potion that would make her barren so she would not lose her beauty. You might ask: If so, why does it say, “Tzillah also gave birth”? The answer is: She gave birth before she drank the potion. Another answer: It says, “Tzillah also gave birth,” to teach that even though she took the potion she gave birth anyway, as the potion did not affect her at all. (@ITRe’m@it) @p1[20]@p2 He was the first one@p3. I.e., “father” means that he was the “first” to dwell in tents and to breed cattle. Rashi says “in the wilderness” since Yaval was different from Hevel who shepherded in a settled area. [In the wilderness] it requires great mastery of the craft. @p1[22]@p2 Sharpens the tools [used for working]@p3. I.e., the verse should be understood by rearranging its order, as if it said: @hh<HEB>לוטש וחורש כל כלי נחושת וברזל@ee<ENG>. Rashi adds the phrase “all tools of crafts,” to imply “tools of crafts” such as those for plowing, cutting and the like, which are sharpened and polished (@hh<HEB>לטישה@hh@ee<ENG>).<QC>
@p1@p2She was Noah’s wife@p3. You might ask: How did Rashi know this? The answer is: She is called Naamah (@hh<HEB>נעמה@ee<ENG>) because her deeds were pleasant (@hh<HEB>נעימה@ee<ENG>) and she behaved modestly. If so, why would she perish in the Flood and not be saved like Noah was? Perforce she was Noah’s wife, and was thus saved from the Flood. @eeAnother answer: Rashi’s proof is the fact that this woman is mentioned where other women are not. And why is this? Because Naamah [was Noah’s wife and she] had three brothers: Yaval, Yuval and Tuval Kayin. And Tuval Kayin was wicked; as Rashi previously explained that he produced weapons for murderers. But Yaval was righteous, dwelling in tents, according to Rashi’s first explanation. Also Yuval was righteous [according to this explanation]. Thus two brothers were righteous, and one was wicked. Noah also had three sons: Shem, Cham and Yefes. Shem and Yefes were righteous, as Rashi explains in Parshas Noah (9:23). And one son was wicked, as is seen there. Accordingly, one should not ask why two [of Noah’s sons] were righteous and one wicked. For Rashi already explained that Naamah was Noah’s wife — and children are usually like the mother’s brothers.<QC>
@p1[24]@p2 His wives separated from him once they fulfilled.<TIE>.<TIE>. because it had been decreed. @p3This phrase [“once they fulfilled.<TIE>.<TIE>.”] is not found in our text of Bereishis Rabbah. It seems that Rashi added this phrase on his own, to explain why they gave birth until now: they wished to fulfill the mitzvah of “Be fruitful and multiply.” See @ITRe’m.@it (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1@p2And sweep everything away@p3. I.e., everyone will die. You might ask: At first Rashi said they separated from Lemech because of the decree on the descendents of Kayin. Why does he say here that it was because of the Flood? The answer is: His wives knew the Flood would come in the days of Lemech. They mistakenly thought it would be in the days of [their husband] Lemech son of Mesushael, a descendent of Kayin. But it was [later,] in the days of [a different] Lemech, the son of Mesushelach [a descendent of Sheis]. @p1@p2This is an absurd @BIkal vachomer@it@p1@p2. @p3But according to [Rashi’s first explanation,] Midrash R. Tanchuma, the @ITkal vachomer@it is not absurd since it does not contradict Kayin’s punishment; it applies only to Lemech’s [unintentional] sin. (@ITRe’m@it) You might ask: What was Lemech’s reasoning [when he put forth his absurd argument]? The answer is that he thought as follows: Kayin killed intentionally and should have been killed immediately, as it says (9:6), “Whoever sheds the blood of man, through man shall his blood be shed.” Yet with his prayer, he held back the decree for seven generations. I, who killed unintentionally, can surely hold back the decree with prayer. (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1[25]@p2 Lemech came.<TIE>.<TIE>. You do what you have been commanded@p3.<TIE>.<TIE>. A difficulty arises: According to the first explanation [brought by Rashi above], that Lemech’s wives separated from him because he killed someone, what did Adam answer them? The answer is: Adam said to them, “Just because Lemech transgressed once, by killing, should he transgress further, and refrain from ‘Be fruitful and multiply’? [By way of metaphor,] if someone ate garlic [and has unpleasant breath, should he therefore eat more garlic]?” (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1@p2His desire for her was greater@p3. Originally he had desire only when he saw Chavah, but now his desire was greater and he had a burning desire even when he did not see her. How does Rashi know this? Because the Torah should have instead said: “His wife conceived again.” That way, “again” would refer to her curse, the pain of pregnancy. Why does the Torah write “again” regarding “Adam knew his wife”? Obviously [he knew her, for] she could not conceive without relations. Perforce, it teaches “that his desire for her was greater.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Another answer: [Rashi knows this because] @hh<HEB>עוד@ee<ENG> is written only when the second action is close to the first. It implies actions in close succession, such as with Leah it is written (29:33): “And she conceived @hh<HEB>עוד@ee<ENG>,” meaning right after the first birth. But here, since Adam separated from his wife for 130 years, it should not say @hh<HEB>עוד@ee<ENG>, but simply, “Adam knew his wife.” Or, it should be called a second marriage, as with Amram who separated from his wife, and it is written (Shemos 2:1) that he “went and married.” So it seems to me. @p1[1]@p2 That on the same day that he was created he begot@p3. [Rashi knows this] because it is written, “This is the book of the generations of man on the day.<TIE>.<TIE>.” implying that on the day he was created he had offspring. Accordingly, “On the day,” is attached to “generations of man,” rather than to “He made him in the likeness of Hashem” which follows. For otherwise, why does it say, “On the day Elohim created?” The Torah should have simply written, “The generations of man, in the image of Hashem He made them,” and that would suffice. Perforce, “This is the book of the generations of man” refers back to (4:1), “The man knew his wife, Chavah” and she gave birth to Kayin and Hevel. @p1[3]@p2 Until now he had separated from his wife.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: On the day he was created he had children. If so, why did he not have [more] children until now, [one hundred and thirty years later]? @p1[24]@p2 He could easily be induced to turn@p3.<TIE>.<TIE>. Rashi is explaining: Since it is written, “Chanoch walked with Elohim,” we see he was righteous. So why did he die before his time? [The answer is] because “he could easily be induced.<TIE>.<TIE>.”<QC>
@p1[28]@p2 From whom the world was built up@p3. Rashi is answering the question: Why does it say @hh<HEB>בן@ee<ENG> here, and not for other descendants? It simply should have written @hh<HEB>ויולד את נח@ee<ENG>. Perforce, @hh<HEB>בן@ee<ENG> connotes @hh<HEB>בנין@ee<ENG> (building). @p1[29]@p2 He will give us rest@p3. Bereishis Rabbah says: Was Lemech a prophet, that [when Noach was born] he knew about this? R. Shimon ben Yehotzedek said: Noach was born circumcised. For when Hashem cursed the earth, Adam said to Him: O Master of the World! Until when? Hashem told him: Until you beget a circumcised person. Once Noach was born circumcised, they said: He will give us rest! (@ITDivrei Dovid@it) @p1@p2If you do not explain it this way then the meaning of the term is not@p3.<TIE>.<TIE>. I.e., if you explain @hh<HEB>ינחמנו@ee<ENG> as “he will comfort us,” then its meaning is not related to the name Noach — and the verse says that Lemech named his son Noach because of @hh<HEB>ינחמנו@ee<ENG>. For @hh<HEB>נח@ee<ENG> [means “rest” and] does not mean “comfort,” so you would have to call him Menachem for the meaning to match the name. And the verse does not say @hb<HEB>יניח@hh ממנו את מעשינו@ee<ENG> [although it is closer to “Noach”] because then it would mean that they rested from the work of their hands, and that did not yet happen. They still needed to plow, sow and thresh. Therefore it says that Noach “will bring us rest from.<TIE>.<TIE>. the @ITanguish@it of our hands,” as he prepared plowing tools for them which they did not have as yet. @eeWhy did Rashi not explain, “From @ITour work@it and the anguish of our hands,” following the order of the verse, but rather put “the anguish of our hands” first? The answer is: “Anguish” refers to the earth’s curse to produce thorns and thistles. And as soon as Noach was born, that curse stopped. But Noach did not make the plow until he grew up. Thus Rashi mentioned “anguish” first, indicating that the verse as well should be understood this way. @p1[32]@p2 I would have to burden him to build many arks@p3. Maharam Yafeh objected: On the contrary, if they would be righteous, together with their wives they would be more than ten and would protect the world, and no arks would be needed! For Rashi explains in Parshas Vayera (18:32) that Avraham did not pray [for Sedom to be saved] for less than ten tzaddikim, since [he knew that] the generation of the Flood had eight tzaddikim, and it did not save their generation. This implies that ten tzaddikim would save their generation. The answer is: Ten tzaddikim would not save the @ITwhole@it generation from the Flood; they would save their city only. Consequently, “I would have to burden him to build many arks” for all the inhabitants of their city, as the Flood would still come and wipe out the rest of the world. (@ITTzeidah L’Derech@it) @p1@p2Of punishable age@p3. You might ask: Rashi already explained what would happen if Noach would have children before the age of five hundred, why was that explanation not sufficient? The answer is: It still needed to be explained what Noach gained by waiting, for if his children would be wicked they too would be destroyed! Thus the second reason is needed, that Noach’s children would not be of punishable age, thus Noach’s merit can save them even if they would be wicked. But all the other people who were not of punishable age were destroyed nonetheless, since they had no [saving] merit. Thus, only one ark was needed. For Noach’s children were not considered righteous just because they were below punishable age — only in Noach’s merit were they saved, which is why Noach did not build a separate ark for each of them. @p1@p2And so it was before the Torah was given. @p3This raises a difficulty: Later, in Parshas Chayei Sarah (23:1), Rashi explains: “When Sarah was one hundred years old, she was like a twenty year old regarding sin.” This implies that from the age of twenty, she was already at a punishable age. Furthermore, Yaakov and his sons did not live to be one hundred and fifty. How could it be that for two thirds of their lives, they were not of punishable age? (@ITNachalas Yaakov, @itsee further explanation there) @p1@p2First you must discuss@p3.<TIE>.<TIE>. Question: [If so,] why is Yefes not mentioned after Shem, [as he too was righteous]? The answer is: The Torah did not wish to change [the order] too much. Since Shem and Cham were born one after the other, it did not interrupt between them. (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1[2]@p2 When they improved (@hh<HEB>מטיבין@p1@p2<ENG>) her appearance@p3. This is similar to the expression @hh<HEB>מטיבין את הנרות@ee<ENG>. It means this because @hh<HEB>טֹבֹת@ee<ENG> conveys that they just now became fair, similar to @hh<HEB>ועפרון ישֵׁב@ee<ENG> (23:10), conveying that Ephron just now sat. Furthermore, @hh<HEB>טבת@ee<ENG> without a @ITvav@it is a singular expression, implying that not all women were fair, only individual women — the beautified brides. But if it were written @hh<HEB>טובות@ee<ENG>, a plural expression, it would imply that the women were always fair, i.e., beautified. @p1@p2Even a man or an animal@p3. [Rashi knows this] because it says @hh<HEB>נשים מכל אשר בחרו@ee<ENG>. The word @hh<HEB>נשים@ee<ENG> implies “even a married woman,” while @hh<HEB>אשר בחרו@ee<ENG> implies “even a man or an animal.” (@ITRe’m@it) @ITRe’m@it asks: It says in Kiddushin 13a that they did not commit adultery. [Why then does Rashi say, “even a married woman”?] @ITNachalas Yaakov @itanswers: It seems that only the sons of rulers committed adultery, not the common people, because @hh<HEB>נשים מכל אשר בחרו@ee<ENG> refers back to: “The sons of the rulers saw.” That is why Rashi says, “The head ruler would then enter and have relations.<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” However, @ITRe’m@it suggests that these might be two conflicting opinions. @p1[3]@p2 Due to man@p3. [Accordingly,] the @hh<HEB>ב@ee<ENG> of @hb<HEB>ב@hhאדם@ee<ENG> is similar to (29:20): “So Yaakov worked for Rochel (@hh<HEB>ברחל@ee<ENG>),” which means “due to Rochel.” @p1@p2For a long time@p3. You might ask: Why cannot @hh<HEB>לעולם@ee<ENG> mean literally, forever? The answer is: Then the verse would imply that Hashem’s spirit will not contend forever, only for a long time. But, afterward it is written, “His days shall be one hundred and twenty years”! This implies that right away, Hashem [tentatively] decreed upon them [to perish after one hundred and twenty years, if they do not repent]. Thus Rashi explains @hh<HEB>לעולם@ee<ENG> as “For a long time.” Accordingly, it means that His spirit will not contend for a long time. Rather, [He will tentatively decree upon them] right away. @p1@p2Whether to destroy or to show mercy@p3. This implies that Hashem did not yet decide @ITdefinitely@it to destroy them. But why did Rashi not say that @hh<HEB>לא ידון רוחי@ee<ENG> means, “I will not wait anymore for man”? Furthermore, how does Rashi know [that it means Hashem’s spirit was undecided]? The answer is: Otherwise it would imply that Hashem already decided definitely to destroy. And this is not so, for only later it is written (v. 7): “I will obliterate mankind,” and that is the first Divine utterance [on this matter]. But beforehand He did not decide [definitely] to destroy. @p1@p2With a @BIsegol@bo. I.e., if the @ITshin @ithas a @ITsegol@it it becomes an expression of @hh<HEB>גם@ee<ENG>. Similarly, @hh<HEB>שַקמתי@ee<ENG> (Shoftim 5:7) is like @hh<HEB>שֶקמתי@ee<ENG>, and @hh<HEB>שַאתה@ee<ENG> (ibid 6:17) is like @hh<HEB>שֶאתה@ee<ENG>. Rashi added the words @hh<HEB>זאת בו@ee<ENG> because otherwise the verse implies another [creature] of flesh, and “also” man is of flesh. But there is no other [creature spoken of here]. @p1[4]@p2 So called because they “fell.” @p3I.e., they were killed. @p1@p2And caused the downfall of the world.@p3 I.e., their descendants copied their evil deeds and were killed as well [in the Flood of Noach]. Rashi is saying that the giants in the days of Enosh and the sons of Kayin were killed (“fell from the world”) when the ocean rose upon them. @p1@p2In Hebrew it means giants@p3. I.e., @hh<HEB>נפילים@ee<ENG> is an adjective, conveying that their great might caused people to fall. (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1@p2In the days of Enosh and sons of Kayin@p3. It seems that the primary explanation [of @hh<HEB>בני האלהים@ee<ENG> is “angels”, see Rashi on v. 2. This] is how Rashi explains @hh<HEB>נפילים@ee<ENG> in Parshas Shelach (Bamidbar 13:33), where he says they were “giants, descended from Shamchazai and Azael, who fell from heaven in the generation of Enosh.” Accordingly, when Rashi says the giants “fell from the world,” it means from the @ITupper@it world, i.e., heaven. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1@p2Though they saw@p3.<TIE>.<TIE>. Meaning, even afterward they were wicked and sinful. Some ask: [How can Rashi say, “Though they saw.<TIE>.<TIE>.?] In Parshas Eikev, on “And you will perish quickly” (Devarim 11:17), Rashi explains that the generation of the Flood had no one to learn from! (@ITNachalas Yaakov, @itsee further explanation there) @p1@p2Giants like them@p3. Rashi is explaining why there were giants in the generation of the Flood as well. Although the [original] giants were wiped out when the ocean flooded upon them, the @hh<HEB>בני אלהים@ee<ENG> came to the daughters of man and they gave birth to giants like them. @p1@p2On account of their destruction for they were wiped out@p3. @hh<HEB>מחויאל@ee<ENG> is from @hh<HEB>נימוחו@ee<ENG>, meaning “wiped out.” @hh<HEB>מתושאל@ee<ENG> is from @hh<HEB>הותשו@ee<ENG>, meaning “torn out.” [Rashi knows that @hh<HEB>אנשי השם@ee<ENG> means @hh<HEB>על שם אבדן@ee<ENG>] because ordinarily it means “men of renown,” whereas these people were wicked. @p1[6]@p2 He would have caused them to rebel@p3. Man caused the animals and beasts to rebel, as they all became perverted [see Rashi on v. 7]. Had man been in heaven, he would have caused the heavenly beings to rebel as well!<QC>
@p1@p2The man. In His heart. Of Hashem. @p3[Rashi explains as he does] because otherwise @hh<HEB>ויתעצב@ee<ENG> contradicts what is written before: @hh<HEB>וינחם@ee<ENG>, which means, “Hashem was comforted.” Rashi is saying that @hh<HEB>ויתעצב@ee<ENG> means [not “grieved” but] “loathsome”, i.e., man became loathsome in the heart of Hashem, [and He decided] to destroy him. @ITMaharshal @itexplains: Since it says that Hashem was comforted, @hh<HEB>ויתעצב@ee<ENG> must refer to man. Thus Rashi explains that man was @hh<HEB>ויתעצב@ee<ENG> to Hashem. But according to Rashi’s alternate explanation, that Hashem’s thought turned from Divine Mercy to Divine Justice, @hh<HEB>ויתעצב@ee<ENG> refers to Hashem [i.e., He mourned]. @p1@p2What to do with man@p3. Rashi is saying that originally, Hashem did not intend to do anything with man. But now He intended to investigate what do to with him. Rashi does not mean that He now decided to do evil, and decreed the Flood. This cannot be, because only afterwards it is written (v. 7), “Adonoy said, ‘I will obliterate mankind,’” and that is His first utterance [on this matter]. “I will obliterate mankind” does not come to explain the turning of Hashem’s thought, i.e., that it turned from Mercy to Justice. For if so, v. 7 should say: “And @ITHe@it said, ‘I will obliterate mankind.’” Why does it say, “@ITAdonoy@it said, ‘I will obliterate.<TIE>.<TIE>.’”? Clearly, it is the beginning of His utterance. Since it is the beginning, this implies that [in this verse,] He had not yet passed judgment on man. Rather, He was investigating what to do with man. (@ITRe’m@it) @p1@p2I rejoiced and made everyone joyful@p3. Meaning, I rejoiced myself and also made others joyful. @p1@p2So it is with acts of Hashem@p3. Question: How could the Rabbi compare the acts of Hashem to the acts of flesh and blood? The answer is: This was only to deflect the heretic’s challenge. But in truth, Hashem’s reason was “For the sake of the righteous.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1@p2For the sake of the righteous@p3. This [is an alternative explanation, and] means to say: “@ITFurthermore@it, for the sake of the righteous.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Otherwise the parable does not fit the message. For no benefit came from the son; it was a case of, “At the time of joy let there be joy.” But benefit does come from the wicked, since the righteous descend from them. Perforce, Rashi means to say, “Furthermore.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (@ITRe’m@it) @p1[7]@p2<TIE>They, too, perverted@p3. This raises a question: Why did the verse not [equate them and] write, “Man and beast”? Thus Rashi offered the alternate explanation, which raises another question: Why did the verse not [make the beasts secondary and] say: “Man, and beast as well”? Thus Rashi offered the first explanation [as both are needed]. (@ITMaharshal@it)<QC>
@p1[9]@p2 Since it mentions him, it tells of his praiseworthiness@bo. The @ITRe’m @itwrites that Scripture repeats Noach’s progeny here, though it already mentioned it in the last Parshah, to tell us that he fathered only these — he did not have more children later, who were unworthy of entering the ark. But the @ITNachalas Yaakov@it disagrees, since Rashi explained above (5:32) that Noach did not begin to have children until age 500 so they would still be young at the time of the Flood and thus be saved @ITeven@it if they were wicked. Rather, the Torah mentions his progeny again here to tell us that they were righteous. For it says here @hh<HEB>אלה תולדות@ee<ENG>, [rather than @hb<HEB>ו@hhאלה@ee<ENG>], thereby disqualifying what preceeded: the generation of the Flood. [See Rashi on @hb<HEB>ו@hhאלה המשפטים@ee<ENG>, Shemos 21:1.] In other words, Noach’s progeny are called @hh<HEB>תולדות@ee<ENG> but those of the generation of the Flood do not deserve to be called @hh<HEB>תולדות@ee<ENG>. @d1That the main progeny of the righteous.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo It seems that Rashi means as follows. It is written, “These are the progeny of Noach,” and then it explains, “Noach was a righteous man,” thus we see that good deeds are also called progeny. And it first states, “Noach was a righteous man,” and only afterwards, “Noach fathered three sons,” thus we see that good deeds are the @ITmain@it progeny. @d1There are others who infer from it to his discredit@bo. Question: How can they infer his discredit, if he was righteous? The answer is: They derive it from, “Noach walked @ITwith@it Elokim,” which Rashi explains [to mean, “Noach required support to uphold him”]. But those who infer his praise interpret “with Elokim” differently, as follows. It is written about Avraham, “Elokim, @ITbefore@it whom I walked,” implying that Avraham was not with Hashem all the time. He was busy with people, drawing them to Hashem. But Noach was not busy with the people of his generation since they were completely wicked. Thus it is written, “Noach walked @ITwith@it Elokim.” I.e., he was busy with nothing else but with Hashem. (@ITMaharshal@it) Alternatively, those who infer “praise” are answering the question: Why did it not say @hh<HEB>בדורו@ee<ENG> [singular]? It is because @hh<HEB>בדורותיו@ee<ENG> [plural] implies that in all the ten generations from Adam until Noach, Noach was the righteous and flawless man. But those who infer “discredit” explain it as follows: Relative to the deeds of these generations, [he was righteous]. But had he lived in the generation of Avraham.<TIE>.<TIE>. Alternatively, those who infer “praise” explain “in his generations” to refer to the ten generations from Adam until Noach. And those who infer “discredit” explain it to refer to the ten generations from Noach until Avraham — but had he lived in the generation of Avraham.<TIE>.<TIE>. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) Both views agree that Noach was righteous only as compared to his generation, not completely righteous. For had he lived in a righteous generation, [all agree that] he surely would have been more righteous. These views differ only over the interpretation of “In his generations.” One holds that it comes to praise him: even in those wicked generations, where he could have learned from their wickedness, he remained righteous — and surely had he lived in a righteous generation. And the other view holds as explained earlier. All agree that in a righteous generation, his present level of righteousness would have been considered insignificant. And all agree that had he been in a righteous generation, he in fact would have been more righteous. For growing up among the righteous is not like growing up among the wicked. [You might ask:] Why does one infer “praise” and the other infer “discredit,” if there is no clear proof either way? [The answer is:] The one who infers “praise” holds that @hh<HEB>בדורותיו@ee<ENG> refers to @hh<HEB>היה@ee<ENG>, which immediately precedes it. Thus the verse is telling us that in his wicked generations, he remained righteous — certainly had he lived in a righteous generation. And the one who infers “discredit” holds that @hh<HEB>בדורותיו@ee<ENG> refers back to @hh<HEB>צדיק@ee<ENG>. Thus the verse is saying, “He was righteous in his generations” — relative to his generations. This is undoubtedly to his discredit. (@ITRe’m@it) One might ask: If the Torah (7:8) does not even mention an impure animal’s discredit [see Bava Basra 123a], why does one view infer a tzaddik’s discredit from our verse? The answer is: The verse implies the [wicked] generation’s discredit, not Noach’s. It is saying that in this generation, even a tzaddik like Noach required Hashem’s support, unlike Avraham [in his generation]. Clearly, it was an inferior generation. (@ITDivrei Dovid@it) @d1Concerning Avraham it says: [“Elokim,] before whom I walked.” @boAccording to Rashi, “Noach walked with Elokim” implies that Noach walked with Hashem alone. Noach separated himself from people since they were all wicked and he feared he would learn from their wicked deeds. For Noach was not so righteous and he needed support, so he “walked with Elokim,” i.e., where there was only Hashem. But Avraham’s righteousness was strong on his own, as he was completely righteous. He went among the wicked to reprove them and convert them, and he did not fear that he might learn from their [wicked] deeds. Thus [Rashi says] he did not need support. @d1Past tense@bo. It is in the @hh<HEB>התפעל@ee<ENG> conjugation. @d1In the @HB<HEB>כבד@BO<ENG> form@bo. I.e., since the @hh<HEB>ל@ee<ENG> of @hh<HEB>התהלך@ee<ENG> has a @ITdagesh@it, it is a @hh<HEB>כבד@ee<ENG> form. @d1The @BIvav@bi at the beginning changes it to the future@bo. I.e., without the @ITvav@it in @hb<HEB>ו@hhהתפלל@ee<ENG>, it also would be past tense. But I was taught that Rashi is referring to the @ITvav@it of @hb<HEB>ו@hhבא@ee<ENG>. For if it would say @hh<HEB>בא והתפלל@ee<ENG> then perforce it would be past tense [in spite of the @ITvav, @itand would mean, “He came @ITand@it prayed”], similar to @hh<HEB>פעל @hbו@hhעשה@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>יצר @hbו@hhברא@ee<ENG>. But since it says @hb<HEB>ו@hhבא@ee<ENG>, this changes it to the future. (@ITKitzur Mizrachi@it) @ee@p1[11]@p2 Lewdness and idolatry@bo. I.e., since either one could be described as @hh<HEB>ותשחת@ee<ENG>, the verse means both. @d1Robbery@bo. [Rashi is explaining that] @hh<HEB>חמסן@ee<ENG> is different from the Rabbinic term @hh<HEB>חמסן@ee<ENG>, which refers to someone who pays [for what he forcibly takes]. But the Scriptural term @hh<HEB>חמסן@ee<ENG> includes outright robbery. See Bava Kama 62a. @p1[12]@p2 Consorted with dissimilar species@bo. Rashi knows this because it is written @hh<HEB>דרכו@ee<ENG>, which implies lewdness, as it is written (Mishlei 30:19): “The @hh<HEB>דרך@ee<ENG> (way) of a man with a young woman.” Rashi did not mention fish because it is written, “On the @ITearth@it” — excluding fish in the sea.<QC>
@p1[13]@p2 Upheaval comes upon the world@bo. Not that upheaval will definitely come; but if death @ITis@it decreed upon them, it is of this type. @d1The good and the bad@bo. I.e., @ITnormally@it it kills bad and good alike. But here, it did not kill the good along with the bad. (@ITMaharshal@it) @d1Only because of robbery@bo. You might ask: Did Rashi not say before that upheaval comes upon the world because of lewdness, implying that they died because of lewdness? The answer is: Both sins played a part. For just robbery, only the wicked people’s fate would be sealed. And for just lewdness, no one’s fate would be sealed. But now since both sins were present, fate was sealed for the wicked and the good alike. We are forced to make this distinction because otherwise the verses are in contradiction. For first it says, “For all flesh had corrupted its way on the earth,” and then it is written, “Elohim said to Noach: ‘The end of all flesh has come before Me.’” This implies that the Flood was due to lewdness. But then it is written, “For the earth is filled with violent crime” — implying that the Flood was due to robbery. Perforce, it means as explained. This answers another question: If “The earth was corrupt” means lewdness @ITand@it idolatry, as Rashi said before, why does Scripture go on to mention only lewdness but not idolatry? For it is written, “For all flesh had corrupted its way,” which means lewdness, as Rashi himself explained. [The answer is:] There was no death penalty for idolatry [alone. Furthermore, it alone] would not kill the good and the wicked alike. [Thus idolatry was not mentioned, since it did not change the decree]. Furthermore, each stole his fellow’s wife, an act that involves both robbery and lewdness. So their fate was in fact sealed for both. The @ITMaharshal@it asks: Why did Rashi (v. 11) not mention robbery together with lewdness and idolatry? The answer is: It is written right before, “Elohim saw,” implying sins between man and God. But robbery is a sin between man and his fellow. @BITogether with @bithe earth@bo. The first explanation raises the question: Why is it not written @hh<HEB>מארץ@ee<ENG>? Thus Rashi brings the alternate explanation, @IT“together with@it the earth.” But this raises the question: Since @hh<HEB>את@ee<ENG> is not an adjective, why is it not written @hh<HEB>עם@ee<ENG>? Thus Rashi needs the first explanation as well. (@ITMaharshal@it) @d1That also three handbreadths@bo. For up to a depth of three handbreadths it is called @hh<HEB>ארץ@ee<ENG>, but further down it is called @hh<HEB>אדמה@hh@ee<ENG>. And here it is written @hh<HEB>את @hbה@hhארץ@ee<ENG>. @ee@p1[14]@p2 Perhaps they will repent@bo. Question: Would not the building of the ark have an opposite effect, for it may cause them @ITnot@it repent? For they could answer Noach: “If the ark’s purpose is really to save you [from the Flood, this makes no sense. For] Hashem has many ways to save you even without an ark!” The answer is: They knew the Flood would come, as Rashi explained in connection with the story of Lemech’s wives (4:24). But they thought it would come in the distant future. His building the ark showed that it was imminent, thus they might repent. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @d1Of cedar wood. That is its name. [@boRashi is answering the question:] Why is @hh<HEB>עצי@ee<ENG> written in the plural form, when @hh<HEB>גפר@ee<ENG> is singular? (@ITR. Yaakov Taryosh@it) @d1Its name relating to sulphur. @boI.e., boiling water comes from the earth’s sulfur; see Sanhedrin 108b and Rosh Hashanah 12a. You might ask: How did Rashi know that the water [of the Flood] was hot? The answer is: Here (8:1) it is written @hh<HEB>וישוכו המים@ee<ENG>, and about Achashveirosh (Esther 7:10) it is written @hh<HEB>וחמת המלך שככה@ee<ENG>. There it means subsiding from a previous heat, as it said before, “His anger @ITburnt@it within him” (ibid. 1:12). And here also it is written @hh<HEB>וישוכו@ee<ENG>, meaning that the water subsided from its boiling and cooled off. @d1Because the waters were calm@bo. You might ask: Why does Rashi bring this here? The answer is: Without Rashi’s above explanation [that @hh<HEB>כופר@ee<ENG> means tar] we would not have asked why Noach’s @ITteivah@it had tar inside and outside, whereas Moshe’s @ITteivah@it had tar only outside. For they seem to be different — here it says @hh<HEB>כופר@ee<ENG> and there it says tar. But now that Rashi explained that @hh<HEB>כופר@ee<ENG> means tar, we see that Noach’s @ITteivah@it had tar just like Moshe’s @ITteivah@it. If so, why did Moshe’s teivah not have tar on the inside and outside, like Noach’s did? Furthermore, without Rashi’s explanation [that @hh<HEB>כופר@ee<ENG> means tar] we could say that @hh<HEB>כופר@ee<ENG> is something that is stronger than clay but weaker than tar. Therefore, clay on the inside and tar on the outside [Moshe’s @ITteivah@it] is the same strength as @hh<HEB>כופר@ee<ENG> on inside and outside [Noach’s @ITteivah@it]. But now that Rashi explained that @hh<HEB>כופר@ee<ENG> means tar, the question arises: Why were both not [built] the same manner? @d1Another reason.<TIE>.<TIE>. @boIt seems that when Rashi explained that the waters were calm for Moshe’s @ITteivah, @ittherefore clay inside and tar outside was sufficient, it means as follows: Surely the waters were calm, so clay inside and tar outside was sufficient. But with Noach’s @ITteivah@it it needed tar inside and out. This raises a question: What is wrong with making it that way also for Moshe? Rashi answers with the second reason: so that Moshe would be spared the odor of tar. This raises the question: Noach was also righteous; [why should he not be spared the odor?] Rashi answers: “But, here at the Flood, because of the force of the water, he tarred it on the inside and the outside.” (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1[16]@p2 Others say it was a precious stone. @boThe word @hh<HEB>צהר@ee<ENG> is similar to @hh<HEB>צהרים@ee<ENG>, denoting illumination. And some say it was a window, for it is written (8:6), “Noach opened the @ITwindow@it of the ark.” If so, [why do the others say it was a precious stone? Because] the window was only for air. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @d1So that the water would flow@bo. I.e., rather than seep inside. You might ask: Why not make it flat, but very strong and thick so the rainwater could not penetrate? The answer is: Rashi means it had an open space of one @ITamoh@it, since a house without air is uninhabitable. But if it would be completely open the rain would fall in. Thus Noach made the open space only one @ITamoh@it in length, with a tiny width of a sixth of an @ITamoh@it, i.e., a @ITtefach@it. [The roof sloped down in four directions from the open space,] and below, the @ITteivah’s@it length was three hundred @ITamos@it, while on top, only one @ITamoh@it in length. This is one three-hundredth. Below, the width was fifty @ITamos@it. Thus the width above was one sixth of an @ITamoh@it, i.e., one @ITtefach@it. For fifty @ITamos@it is three hundred @ITtefachim@it, and the width [above] was one three-hundredth [of the width below]. @d1So that the rain may not seep through. @boRashi is answering the question: Are not ship openings normally on the top? @p1[17]@p2 “I am now prepared to agree.” @boRashi is answering the question: @hb<HEB>ו@hhאני@ee<ENG> implies that another being wants it, and I, too, concur. How can it be said about Hashem that another being assists Him, Heaven forbid? Thus Rashi answers that @hb<HEB>ו@hhאני@ee<ENG> refers to the angels, who agreed long ago — “And I am now prepared to agree.” Alternatively, Rashi is answering the question: Why is it written @hh<HEB>ואני הנני@ee<ENG>, a double expression? @d1With those.<TIE>.<TIE>. @boMeaning: I consulted the angels whether to create man, and they answered, “What is man that You should consider him.” Now, I agree with them. @d1Flood waters. It ruined.<TIE>.<TIE>. It confused.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo You might ask: How does Rashi know that it means these three things? The answer is: The @hh<HEB>ב@ee<ENG> of @hh<HEB>מבּול@ee<ENG> has a @ITdagesh@it, and such a @ITdagesh@it implies that the first letter of the root is a @hh<HEB>י@ee<ENG> or a @hh<HEB>נ@ee<ENG>, or, the @ITdagesh@it represents a double letter. According to the first meaning, “it ruined everything,” it is as if it had written @hb<HEB>נ@hhבול@ee<ENG>, as in @hh<HEB>נבול תבול@ee<ENG> (Shemos 18:18), meaning “wear out.” According to the second meaning, “it confused everything,” it is as if it had written @hh<HEB>מבול@ee<ENG> twice, i.e., @hh<HEB>בלבל@ee<ENG>, meaning “confusion.” According to the third meaning, “it brought everything,” it is as if it had written @hb<HEB>י@hhובל@ee<ENG>, as in (Tehillim 76:12) @hh<HEB>יובילו שי למורא@ee<ENG>, meaning “will bring.” @ee@p1[18]@p2 A covenant was necessary@bo. It is as if it said, “I have established My covenant with you, @ITand then@it you shall go into the ark.” But otherwise you could not go in. @d1And so that they not kill him@bo. You might ask: Why not say this was the only reason [for the covenant]? The answer is: Then it should say, “I @ITwill@it establish My covenant.” Since it says @hh<HEB>והקמותי@ee<ENG>, “I established,” it means: When I created the fruits, I already established My covenant with them to fulfill My word. [And if the covenant was for the fruits alone, why does it say @hh<HEB>אתך@ee<ENG>?] (@ITMaharshal@it) @d1That marital relations were prohibited to them@bo. Rashi knows this because of the textual changes between Scripture’s description of their coming into the ark and their leaving the ark. When they left the ark it is written (8:16): “Depart from the ark, @ITyourself and your wife@it.” I will later explain @ITb’ezras Hashem@it why it is written (ibid. v. 18), “Noach departed from the ark together with his sons, his wife and son’s wives,” [implying they were separate]. Question: Why, on the verse of “Noach went in.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (7:7), did Rashi repeat his comment, “Because they were forbidden marital relations”? Furthermore, Rashi explained there, “Since the world was in a state of grief.” Why did he not mention this here? It seems the answer is: The command [to enter, which appears here,] mentions entering the ark first, and afterwards the separation. But when it comes to actually entering, the separation is mentioned first and only afterwards does it says “@ITinto the ark@it.” This is because Noach decided on his own to separate even before entering the ark, because he saw the world was already in a state of grief. For Noach did not enter the ark until forced by the water, as Rashi explains (7:7). Thus the grief had already begun [before he entered], and marital relations became prohibited. This is why Rashi mentioned grief then. But the command [as mentioned here] was to enter the ark @ITbefore@it the rainfall, when there was not yet grief. (@ITDivrei Dovid@it) @p1[19]@p2 Even the demons@bo. [Rashi knows this] because it says afterwards, “From all flesh,” i.e., all that have flesh. Thus, “From all living things” comes to include even demons, which do not have flesh. @d1From the least of them@bo. Rashi is answering the question: Does it not say a little later (7:2), “Take to yourself @ITseven @itpairs”? @p1[20]@p2 Came of their own accord. @boRashi is saying that they @ITall@it came, even the ones that corrupted their way. But Noach permitted only “those that the ark took in.” What forced Rashi to explain that they came of their own accord? The answer is: Noach would otherwise have to trap them during the 120 years he had. Perforce, Hashem would give him a sign to know which ones consorted with their own species, as one opinion in the Midrash indeed says. [But Scripture mentions no such sign, so this cannot be the simple meaning.] For if Noach had no sign other than the ark taking them in, [a problem would arise:] there are numerous rare species, found only in the deserts, mountains and forests, which are very difficult to trap. And each comes out in its own special season. After extended effort to trap a specimen, Noach would have to bring it to the ark to see if it is taken in — perhaps it did not consort with its own species, as “all flesh corrupted its way”! Thus all of Noach’s trouble would be for naught, and his whole life would not be long enough to trap each species many times. Therefore, Rashi explains that they “came of their own accord and all those that the ark took in.” (@ITR. Yaakov Taryosh@it) @p1[22]@p2 This refers to his constructing the ark@bo. Rashi is answering the question: Doesn’t “Noach did so” imply that he entered the ark, as commanded? But afterwards it says (7:1), “Adonoy said to Noach, Come into the ark.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Clearly, Noach did not yet enter the ark! Perforce, “This refers to his @ITconstructing@it the ark.”<QC>
@p1[1]@p2 [We learn] from this that we tell@bo.<TIE>.<TIE>. This raises a question: Now that the Torah taught us the proper conduct of telling only @hh<HEB>מקצת@ee<ENG>, i.e., part of a man’s good qualities, the man will understand on his own that his good qualities are double this, [thus defeating the purpose]! It seems the answer is: Telling @hh<HEB>מקצת@ee<ENG> does not necessarily mean half. It could be a small amount: a tenth or a hundredth. Thus, the man will not know the extent of his good qualities. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1[2]@p2 We learn that Noach studied Torah@bo. For if not, how would Noach know [which ones were clean]? At that time, “clean” and “not clean” did not yet apply. (@ITRe’m@it) Still, the Gemara needed to say that the ark took them in and they came on their own. For otherwise how could Noach check them? One of the signs of cleanness [for birds] is that the gizzard is peelable — and this can be known only after slaughter. (@ITKitzur Mizrachi@it) You might ask: How did Rashi know that Noach studied Torah? Perhaps Noach took seven pairs because the ark accepted exactly so many! The answer is: That explanation is unlikely because the statement [in Sanhedrin 108b] implies that the ark rejected only those animals that consorted with another species. And it cannot be that each unclean species had exactly one [properly behaved] pair, and each clean species had exactly seven [such] pairs. Rather, there were many pairs from each, and Noach took seven pairs from the clean and one pair from the unclean. How did he know? He must have studied Torah. In fact in the verse itself it is written, “Take to @ITyourself@it,” implying that Noach did the taking, [not the ark]. (@ITGur Aryeh@it) @d1So that he might use some as sacrifices@bo. When it says @hh<HEB>שבעה שבעה@ee<ENG> it means a total of seven, that is, three couples and one single. Just as @hh<HEB>שנים שנים@ee<ENG> means one male and one female, so too @hh<HEB>שבעה שבעה@ee<ENG> means seven birds, male and female. This leaves one without a mate. Rashi is thus answering the question: Why was one bird left single? The answer is: “So that he might use some as sacrifices.” And the single one was male. (@ITsource unknown@it) I was taught [differently,] that the reason [for seven full pairs] is as follows: Upon leaving the ark, Noach needed to offer four [males as] burnt offerings. This was for the four couples saved in the ark — Noach and wife, plus his three sons and their wives — as they might have sinned in thought, [for which a burnt offering atones]. And four females were thanksgiving offerings for the four couples, because it says (Berachos 54b), “Four people need to offer thanks: seafarers.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Also, Cham and his wife sinned by having marital relations in the ark. Thus Noach offered a [female] sin offering for each. This accounts for six pairs. And one pair was to sustain the species, just like the unclean species. @ITMoreinu HaRav Nosson@it and the @ITGur Aryeh@it wrote different explanations; the reader may choose. (@ITKitzur Mizrachi@it) @p1[3]@p2 What is not explicit.<TIE>.<TIE>. from that which is explicit@bo. We need not ask: Earlier, the birds were mentioned before the animals, as it says, “From the @ITbirds@it of their kind, from the @ITanimals@it of their kind” (6:20). If so, why does it not mention here [the birds first, and say] “clean” for the birds rather than for the animals, and then learn the animals from the birds? The answer is: Clean animals were mentioned first, to say about them @hh<HEB>שבעה שבעה@ee<ENG> — thus hinting to Noach that seven were needed to offer sacrifices, [which come only from clean species]. Had it mentioned birds first, Noach would not know that seven was because of offerings. He would think that the animals are like the birds, about which it says, “To keep seed alive upon the face of the earth,” and the seven animals were to keep seed alive. That is why it mentioned the animals first. However, @ITMahara’i @itanswered differently; see there. @p1[4]@p2<TIE>This refers to the seven days of mourning.<TIE>.<TIE>. @boFor if not, why were these “seven days” expressly mentioned? (@ITKitzur Mizrachi@it) Question: Mesushelach and Chanoch were righteous as well, [so why was Noach singled out as “righteous in his generations”]? It seems the answer is: [Scripture mentioned] only someone whose married sons and their spouses were worthy of being saved with him. And this was true only of Noach. (@ITDivrei Dovid@it)<QC>
@p1[7]@p2 Since the world was in a state of grief@bo. It seems that Rashi is answering the question: Why does “The flood waters were on the earth” immediately precede “Noach went in.<TIE>.<TIE>.”? It is to tell us why marital relations were prohibited — the Flood came and the world was in a state of grief. Thus it is written right afterwards, “Noach went in, and his sons.<TIE>.<TIE>.” to show why the men entered separately and the women entered separately, and relations were forbidden. But why does it say the same about their departure [from the ark]: “Noach departed with his sons, his wife and son’s wives” (8:18)? Relations were then permitted! It is because, as Rashi explains later (9:9), Noach was afraid to beget children after the Flood until Hashem gave him a sign that He would not bring another Flood. Thus, [since there was still separation at the time of his departure], it is written “Noach departed with his sons, etc.” (@ITGur Aryeh@it) @p1[9]@p2 Of their own accord@bo. Otherwise it should say [not @hh<HEB>בָּאוּ@ee<ENG>, but] @hh<HEB>הובְאו@ee<ENG> (they were brought). [You might ask:] Why did Rashi not offer this comment earlier, on: “Two of each will@IT come to you@it to be kept alive” (6:20)? [The answer is:] There Scripture tells us the ark’s benefit: it will save them. But here it is an extra phrase, thus we infer that they came of their own accord. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) [Note: Rashi’s second comment on this verse used to appear first. Accordingly, you might ask:] Why does Rashi reverse the order of the verse and first explain, “Of their own accord,” and then, “The minimum number was two”? It seems the answer is as we explained earlier (6:20): If the animals had not come on their own, and Noach would have had to trap them, Hashem would have given him a sign [to know which ones cleaved to their own species], as we explained. And we would say that this sign is hinted to in our verse: “Two by two,” i.e., animals that go as a couple of male and female, unaccompanied by other animals. So [that we will not say this,] Rashi first explains that @hh<HEB>בָּאוּ@ee<ENG> implies that they @ITall@it came on their own, as we explained on 6:20. Thus Noach could not know [through the sign of “two by two”], since @ITall@it the animals and birds came. Furthermore, since [Rashi first explains that] they came on their own, then if Noach had such a sign he would need to choose from among the many animals in each species that cleaved to their own kind. Yet Noach would have no way to choose. If he took these, he would cause those to die! Which should he reject? Surely [Noach had no sign], and whatever the ark took in was saved. Thus, “two by two” [is not a sign but is as Rashi says:] “They were all equal in this number.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (@ITR. Yaakov Taryosh@it) @d1The minimum number was two@bo. For if not, it contradicts what was said before (v. 2): “Of every clean animal, take to yourself @ITseven@it pairs.” @p1[11]@p2<TIE>To release their waters@bo. [Rashi is explaining that] this was not an ordinary bursting, which conveys that the object is now broken. This bursting conveys that the wellsprings grew stronger.<QC>
@p1[13]@p2 Scripture teaches.<TIE>.<TIE>. @boFor if not, it should say just @hh<HEB>ביום הזה@ee<ENG>, as it says earlier (v. 11).<QC>
@p1[14]@p2 [The word @HB<HEB>ציפור@d1<ENG>] is in the construct state@bo. I.e., we should not think that @hh<HEB>צפור@ee<ENG> stands on its own and @hh<HEB>כנף@ee<ENG> stands on its own. [This cannot be,] since a @hh<HEB>צפור@ee<ENG>, too, has a @hh<HEB>כנף@ee<ENG>. Alternatively, if @hh<HEB>כל כנף@ee<ENG> is a different thing, how could it come into the ark with Noach? There cannot be a wing without a bird! Thus, it must be in the construct state. Rashi then answers the questions: [If so,] why is it necessary to write @hh<HEB>כנף@ee<ENG>? Obviously, a bird has wings! Furthermore, how can it say @hb<HEB>כל@hh כנף@ee<ENG>? A bird does not have all the wings in the world! Rashi answers: It means, “Birds of @ITevery@it winged species, including locusts,” since they, too, have wings. But @hh<HEB>צפור@ee<ENG> [alone] does not include locusts, as they are not birds. The @ITMaharshal@it explains that if not for the construct state, we would interpret it as @hh<HEB>כל צפור כנף@ee<ENG>, thereby excluding anything without a wing. And locusts would be excluded too, since they are not called birds.<QC>
@p1[16]@p2 He protected him@bo. Otherwise why does it say, “Hashem shut him in”? Noach already built the ark and entered it as commanded, to be thereby saved. [Compare this with next entry.] It must refer back to (6:18), “And I will establish My covenant.<TIE>.<TIE>.” [on which Rashi explains, “.<TIE>.<TIE>.that the evil people of that generation not kill him.”] But without Hashem’s protection, Noach could not survive. (@ITKitzur Mizrachi@it) @d1The simple explanation.<TIE>.<TIE>. He shut before him against the waters@bo. In other words, [it does not mean shutting the door. Rather,] Hashem’s command to build the ark and enter it is how He shut before him against the waters. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1[17]@p2 It was immersed in water@bo. Rashi is answering the question: After forty days there was high water. Why did the ark not lift up before? Because, “It was immersed eleven cubits in water.” @p1[18]@p2 By themselves@bo. [Rashi knows this] because if they became powerful from the forty days of [rain of] the Flood, the order should be reversed and it should have written: “There was a Flood on the earth for forty days. @ITThe waters were powerful and increased greatly over the earth@it and lifted the ark, and it rose [high] above the earth, and the ark moved on the surface of the waters.” Rather, “The waters were powerful” was written at the end to teach that the [waters of the] deep rose “by themselves” and made the waters powerful. The @ITRe”m@it explained differently: The rain stopped after forty days. And the water’s power could not have been during these forty days, for it is written (v. 24), “The waters were powerful over the earth for 150 days.” And it is not logical to say that the first “powerful” [mentioned in our verse] was from the rain, and the second “powerful prevailed” [of v. 24] was from the deep; [rather, the waters became powerful by themselves]. @p1[20]@p2<TIE>Once the water reached the level@bo.<TIE>.<TIE>. You might ask: How does Rashi know this? Perhaps it means fifteen @ITamos@it above the ground! The answer is: Then the high mountains would not have been covered with water. And in the verse it is written (v. 19), “And they covered all the high mountains.” Thus Rashi explains, “Above the peaks.<TIE>.<TIE>.”<QC>
@p1[22]@p2 A breath of the spirit of life. @boThe Ibn Ezra writes that @hh<HEB>נשמת רוח חיים@ee<ENG> refers only to man. But [the @ITRe’m @itdisagrees, and says that] the text of Rashi should read @hh<HEB>נשימה@ee<ENG>, not @hh<HEB>נשמה@ee<ENG>, and it means “breath,” not “soul.” For animals have no @hh<HEB>נשמה@ee<ENG>, only man. Pertaining to man only is it written (2:7), “And He blew into his nostrils the @hh<HEB>נשמת חיים@ee<ENG>,” but not about other creatures. @d1But not the fish in the sea. @boPerhaps this was Rashi’s intention when on “For all flesh had corrupted.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (6:12), he commented: “Even cattle and beasts.<TIE>.<TIE>.” but omitted fish. The verse itself implies this, for it is written @hh<HEB>על הארץ@ee<ENG> — but not fish in the sea. (@ITKitzur Mizrachi@it) @p1[23]@p2<TIE>It is in the @HB<HEB>וַיִפְעַל@HB@p2<ENG> form.@p3 @hh<HEB>וַיִפְעַל@hh@ee<ENG> is the simple verb form, like @hh<HEB>וירא@hh@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>ויתן@hh@ee<ENG>.

It is not the @hh<HEB>וַיִפָּעֶל@hh@ee<ENG> form, which is passive — as in @hh<HEB>וימחו מן הארץ@hh@ee<ENG>, “they were obliterated from the earth.” @d1This is from the forms [of the verbs:] @HB<HEB>ויפן ויבן@ee<ENG>. Rashi is answering the question: If it is in the simple @hh<HEB>וַיִפְrַל@ee<ENG> form, why is it vowelized @hh<HEB>ויִמח@ee<ENG>, which is a strong verb form, rather than @hh<HEB>ויָמח@ee<ENG>, which denotes a simple verb? Rashi answers: “This is from the forms @hh<HEB>ויפן ויבן@ee<ENG>,” which are also vowelized with a @ITchirik @itunder the @ITyud@it. This differs from the @ITRe’m’s@it explanation, that [Rashi is addressing the point: Why is it vowelized @hh<HEB>וימַח@ee<ENG> rather than @hh<HEB>וימֶח@ee<ENG>? And Rashi answers that] it is like @hh<HEB>ויפן@ee<ENG> but here the @ITmem @ithas a @ITpatach@it because of the following @ITches,@it which is a guttural letter. @d1Every word whose last root letter@bo.<TIE>.<TIE>. Rashi is answering the question: Why do all these verbs have a @ITchirik@it under the @ITyud@it? @d1Only Noach@bo. You might ask: What is Rashi’s source [in the verse to support the Midrashic explanation]? The answer is: It is written @hh<HEB>אך נח@ee<ENG>, and @hh<HEB>אך@ee<ENG> comes to exclude something. But there is nothing here to exclude; [only Noach was left]! Rather, it means that part of Noach’s very self was excluded. I.e., his vitality was diminished. “He was coughing.<TIE>.<TIE>.”<QC>
@p1[1]@p2 The merit that they did not corrupt@bo.<TIE>.<TIE>. This implies that the other animals corrupted their ways on their own, not due to demons. Otherwise, what was the merit of these animals? The same is implied by, “They did not cohabit in the ark,” meaning, on their own. (@ITKitzur Mizrachi@it) Both merits were needed, since “not corrupting their ways” was not an active mitzvah; it was merely refraining from sin. (Although it says in Makkos 23b that he who passively refrains from a sin is rewarded as if he did a mitzvah, but it says in Kiddushin 39b that this applies only when a chance to sin presented itself but he held back.) Therefore the animals needed also the merit of not cohabiting in the ark, which was self-imposed abstinence from permitted behavior. But this merit alone was insufficient, as it somewhat resembled doing a mitzvah without being commanded, [which is a lesser merit]. For we have no source to indicate that the animals were forbidden to cohabit in the ark. Hashem forbade only Noach and his sons. Although Rashi later says that, “Let them spread over the @ITearth@it” (v. 17), teaches that the animals had a prohibition to propagate in the ark, they accepted this upon themselves without Hashem’s command. Why does the verse not say that Hashem remembered also the birds and Noach’s sons? It seems the answer is: Cham, and the raven, sinned by cohabiting in the ark. That is why Noach’s sons and the birds are not mentioned. [If so, why are beasts and animals mentioned, when the dog cohabited in the ark (Bereishis Rabba 36:7)? The answer is:] There is an uncertainty about dogs. Perhaps they are in the category of “beasts”; perhaps in that of “animals.” Although Heaven surely knows, still, the Sages disagreed about it. Thus we see that Hashem’s will is not to resolve it, and therefore, Scripture does not omit either beasts or animals [although dogs are included in one of these two categories]. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @d1A spirit of comforting@bo. Rashi is answering the question: If it was an actual wind, why is written afterwards, “And the water subsided”? On the contrary, it is written (Tehillim 147:8), “He blows His wind; water runs.” [I.e., wind does not calm the waters.] (@ITDevek Tov@it) Alternatively, Rashi knows this because it says, “Over the @ITearth@it.” How could a wind blow over the earth’s surface when the water covered the earth? But if it was “a spirit of comforting,” it is understandable. “Over the earth” then means, “On account of the matters of the earth.” In other words, for the sake of man who dwells on the earth. @p1[2]@p2 For which the world had need@bo. You might ask: If the world has need of them, why were they not created at the time of Creation? The answer is: Before the Flood they were not needed, as people were healthy and robust. After the Flood, people became weak [and there was a need for them].<QC>
@p1[3]@p2 They began to diminish@bo. We cannot say they were completely diminished on Sivan 1, as the waters continued diminishing until the 27th of the second month, when the earth became dry (v. 14). Rather, they now @ITbegan@it to diminish. @d1On Kislev 27 the rains ceased@bo. You might ask: Did Rashi not say before (7:12) that they ceased on Kislev 28? The answer is: There, Rashi explained that they ceased on Kislev 28 because the first day did not count in the forty days of rain. It did not count because its [preceding] night did not have rain. For it says (7:11), “On that @ITday,@it all the wellsprings.<TIE>.<TIE>. burst open.” This means at daytime, not at night. Nevertheless, it was considered a [half] day. Thus, Marcheshvan counted for twelve full days and one [half] day, and Kislev counted for twenty-seven full days. And the rain did not cease until the morning of the 28th. So the last night, when added to the first day, completed the forty full days. Thus it could be said that the rains ceased on Kislev 28, as they still fell on its [preceding] night. And it could be said that the rains ceased on Kislev 27, because in the daytime of the 28th there was no rain. @d1Which accounts for three days in Kislev@bo. This counts the following night. Also the 29 days of Teves counts the following night. @p1[4]@p2Which is the seventh month from Kislev, in which the rain stopped@bo. The counting cannot start from the rainfall, as it is not logical that the count of 150 days includes forty of rain and [110] of powerful waters. It must be either rain alone or powerful waters alone. Since it cannot be rain alone [see 7:17], it must be powerful waters alone. Thus they were two separate periods and did not finish until Sivan 1. @d1Immersed eleven @BIamohs@bi in the water@bo. Meaning: at least eleven @ITamohs@it were immersed, maybe more. For there might be mountains higher than those of Ararat, and the ark did not come to a rest earlier because it did not reach those mountains. (@ITR. Yaakov Taryosh@it) @p1[5]@p2 If you might say.<TIE>.<TIE>. Elul@bo. Furthermore, we could not learn that the ark was immersed eleven @ITamohs@it if “In the tenth, on the first of the month” means Elul. For from Sivan 1 until Elul 1 there are ninety days, thus the water receded one @ITamoh@it every five or six days. Accordingly, the ark would have been immersed twelve and a third @ITamohs@it. @d1“The tenth” can only be counted@bo.<TIE>.<TIE>. For the ark did not come to rest until after the 40 days of rain and the 150 days of powerful waters were finished. And this was in Sivan, not in Iyar. @d1A total of sixty days from when the mountain peaks appeared.<TIE>.<TIE>. @bo[You might ask: Why does it not total sixty-one? The answer is] that the forty days after [the mountains appeared] is counted from the very beginning of the forty days, producing thirty-nine full days [since one night is missing. See entries on v. 3]. With the twenty-one days of sending the dove, it makes sixty. Since Av and Elul together are only fifty-nine days, Rosh Chodesh Tishrei must be counted in the twenty-one days [of sending the dove.]<QC>
@p1[6]@p2 From when the mountain peaks appeared@bo. We cannot count from when the ark rested, and say that “the tenth” means the tenth month from the rain’s ceasing, just as “the seventh” is the seventh month from when they ceased — and accordingly, the ark would be immersed twelve and a third @ITamohs@it. [Because] if so, this verse should come earlier, rather than following: “The mountaintops became visible.” The @ITRe’m@it asks: Why did the dove not find a place to rest, if it was sent forty-seven days after the mountain peaks appeared? This was only fourteen days before the water began to dry, and assumedly, all the high and low mountain peaks had appeared, as well as some tall trees, etc. It seems the answer is: Although the mountain peaks had appeared, the dove could not rest on the ground because the water had not begun to dry. And the high trees were uprooted and wiped out by the flood waters, as the Midrash implies. @d1To the window@bo. Meaning, this window was their light source. @d1And not the door.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Why did it say before (6:16) “opening,” and here, “window?” He answers: “This is not the door.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Although Rashi on 6:16 brought two meanings for @hh<HEB>צוהר@ee<ENG> — “window” and “precious stone” — as he was in doubt, this verse implies it was a window. Some say that @hh<HEB>לצוהר@ee<ENG> means “for illumination,” similar to @hh<HEB>צהרים@ee<ENG>. Thus, Rashi is explaining that Noach opened the @ITwindow@it which he had made @ITfor light@it, and not for entry and exit. You might ask: If so, [that the window provided light], why did he need the light of the precious stone? The answer is: It was needed for nights, and for the days when the window was closed. For it says, “Noach opened the window.<TIE>.<TIE>.” [implying that some days the window was closed]. (@ITKitzur Mizrachi@it) @p1[7]@p2 Because it suspected him concerning his mate@bo. Meaning: [Its suspicion was] concerning @ITNoach’s@it mate — that [Noach and] his wife were having marital relations in the ark. This is because the raven cohabited in the ark, and one accuses another of his own flaw (Kiddushin 70b). Thus the raven, too, did not want to be separated from its mate. And this is the explanation in Sanhedrin 108b as well. (@ITR. Yaakov Taryosh@it) @d1During the time of Eliyahu. @boA hint to this [Midrashic explanation] is that the word @hh<HEB>יבֹשת@ee<ENG> is written without the @hh<HEB>ו@ee<ENG>, yielding the letters @hh<HEB>תשבי@ee<ENG> — a hint to @hh<HEB>אליהו התשבי@ee<ENG>. Furthermore, it is written “the @ITwater@it dried up” rather than “the @ITearth@it dried up,” alluding to [the drought in] Eliyahu’s days. (@ITMaharshal@it)<QC>
@p1[8]@p2 This does not refer to sending it on an errand.<TIE>.<TIE>. @boFor @hh<HEB>שליחות@ee<ENG> is only [sending] someone with intelligence. Earlier (v. 7), [regarding the raven,] Rashi saw no need to explain this. For there it is written, “Going to and fro,” on which Rashi comments, “It flew around, circling the ark.” Clearly, this is not @hh<HEB>שליחות@ee<ENG>, therefore Rashi did not comment when Noach sent the raven. [The @ITKitzur Mizrachi@it explains differently:] Rashi did not [make this] comment regarding the raven because Rashi had the following question: Why did it not say about sending the raven, “To see if the water had subsided,” as it says about sending the dove? Apparently, because Noach did not send the raven to see if the water subsided! Rather, he drove it out to seek its own place because it [sinned and] cohabited in the ark. But Noach did not do this right after its misdeed, since the water still covered the earth, and driving it out then would make its species extinct. This also explains why Noach waited seven days before sending the dove. He should have sent it immediately, if the raven did not fulfill its errand! Perforce, Noach did not send the raven “to see” [if there still was water]. Accordingly, “He sent out the raven” is similar in meaning to, “Moshe sent his father-in-law off” (Shemos 18:27), and other verses, which do not mean sending to bring back a response. That is why Rashi did not make this comment [regarding the raven]. But with sending the dove, which Noach indeed sent “to see” [if there still was water], it appeared like a @hh<HEB>שליחות@ee<ENG>. [Thus, Rashi needed to comment.] (@ITKitzur Mizrachi@it) [Rashi knows that Noach sent the dove on its way] because it says @hh<HEB>מאתו@ee<ENG>, implying that it will no longer be “with him.” (@ITDivrei Dovid@it)<QC>
@p1[11]@p2 This is because wherever @HB<HEB>יונה@BO<ENG>.<TIE>.<TIE>. @boMeaning: Even had the verse said @hh<HEB>טריפה בפיה@ee<ENG> [the more standard form], it still would apply to a male dove. But since the dove was indeed male, Scripture preferred the masculine form, @hh<HEB>טרף@ee<ENG>. @d1Means: “he seized.” @boAs opposed to meaning “he killed,” as in, “Like a wolf that preys (@hh<HEB>יטרוף@ee<ENG>)” (49:27). Since every preying animal seizes [its victim], one who seizes is called @hh<HEB>טורף@ee<ENG>. [You might ask:] Why did Noach send the male [dove]? Was he not concerned that it would suspect him, as the raven did? The answer is: A person accuses another of his own flaw (Kiddushin 70b). Therefore, because the raven cohabited in the ark, it suspected Noach, too, of marital relations. And Noach intended to bring this out into the open: for the dove was also male, yet it went on its errand. Why? Because the dove [unlike the raven] did not cohabit in the ark. Thus he did not suspect that Noach will have relations with his mate. (@ITMaharshal@it) @d1She said, “Better that my food be.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @boAnd the verse reads as follows: @hh<HEB>עלה זית@ee<ENG> — “bitter as an olive.” @hh<HEB>טרף@ee<ENG> — “my food.” @hh<HEB>בפיה@ee<ENG> — “she said.” @p1[12]@p2 @HB<HEB>וייחל@BO<ENG> [means] he had forbearance@bo. Rashi is saying that [the reflexive form @hh<HEB>וייחל@ee<ENG> was used because] the point was easy to understand without analysis: if the waters dried up in seven days, they will dry up more if Noach will wait another seven days. (@ITMaharshal@it)<QC>
@p1[17]@p2 But it is read @HB<HEB>היצא@BO<ENG>.@bo Meaning, even without the @hh<HEB>ו@ee<ENG> it may be read @hh<HEB>הוצא@ee<ENG>. For the @hh<HEB>ו@ee<ENG> is the [sometimes] absent first letter of the three letter root (in place of the @hh<HEB>י@ee<ENG> of @hh<HEB>יצא@ee<ENG>). Thus, Rashi says it is read with a @hh<HEB>י@ee<ENG>, because the @hh<HEB>י@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>ו@ee<ENG> are interchangeable, yielding @hh<HEB>היוצא@ee<ENG>. (@ITMaharshal@it) [Rashi knows this because] @hh<HEB>היצא@ee<ENG> means Noach should cause them to leave by themselves, whereas @hh<HEB>הוצא@ee<ENG> means he should remove them himself. (@ITKitzur Mizrachi@it) @p1[19]@p2 They accepted@bo.<TIE>.<TIE>. Rashi is answering the question: No beast or bird remained in the world. How could they go to their families? Thus Rashi explains that they accepted to keep to their own species, i.e., to be a family. And this is what R. Yochanan meant when he said (Sanhedrin 108b), “According to their families, but not they themselves.” (@ITR. Yaakov Taryosh@it) @p1[20]@p2 To sacrifice.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo The @ITRe’m@it writes that Rashi is explaining how Noach knew he should bring sacrifices, although there was no such command from Hashem. Rashi explains that Noach reasoned: “Hashem would not have commanded me to take in seven of each.<TIE>.<TIE>.” But if it is as the @ITRe’m @itexplained, Rashi should have explained this on, “Noach built an altar,” or on, “And brought up burnt-offerings on the altar.” Thus it seems to me [to explain differently.] Noach knew on his own to bring offerings to Hashem, just as Hevel brought offerings for the goodness he received from Hashem. Surely Noach should bring offerings as thanksgiving, since he was saved from the Flood, and “four people need to offer thanks: Seafarers.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (Berachos 54b) Rather, Rashi is answering the question: Why did Noach bring a burntoffering from each and every clean animal and bird? Was it not enough to bring for himself, his wife, his sons and their wives? Why did he bring from all the species? Rashi answers: “He thought: Hashem would not have commanded me to take in seven of each.<TIE>.<TIE>.” This answers the difficulties raised by the @ITRe’m@it. @p1[21]@p2<TIE>The expression is repeated, as an oath@bo. We cannot say that one expression of “Never again” refers to the destroying of three handbreadths’ depth of the ground, and the other expression of “Never again” refers to the smiting of every living thing. For both could be included in one phrase: “Never again will I curse the ground or smite every living thing.” Perforce, “Never again” is repeated to serve as an oath. This seems preferable to @ITRe’m’s@it explanation, that [one expression of] “Never again will I curse” refers to destroying the three handbreadths’ depth of the ground as well as the smiting of every living thing — and perforce, the expression is repeated to serve as an oath. @d1That is.<TIE>.<TIE>. the verse: “That I have sworn .<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo The @ITRe’m@it asks: Why does Rashi not bring the verse written in this passage as his proof that it was repeated as an oath? For it says (9:11): “I will keep My @hh<HEB>ברית@ee<ENG> with you”, implying that Hashem already made a @hh<HEB>ברית@ee<ENG>, and now wishes to establish it. Why did Rashi need a verse from the Prophets, “That I have sworn.<TIE>.<TIE>.,” to prove this? The @ITRe’m @itleft this unanswered, but perhaps the answer is: The term @hh<HEB>ברית@ee<ENG> implies only a promise, not an oath. Thus, Rashi had to prove it from, “That I have sworn.<TIE>.<TIE>.,” which clearly implies that the repetition constitutes an oath. @p1[22]@p2 Half of Kislev, Teves, and half of Shevat is the cold season. @boRashi’s text should read: Half of Kislev, Teves, and half of Shevat is @hh<HEB>חורף@ee<ENG>, winter. (@ITRe’m@it) But the @ITNachalas Yaakov@it writes that he sees no need to alter the text; it is indeed as Rashi explained [in the extant text]. @d1@HB<HEB>קור@BO<ENG> is half of Shevat, Adar, and half of Nissan. @bo[This version follows the alteration of the @ITRe’m. @itBut] the correct version is: @hh<HEB>קור@ee<ENG> is half of Kislev, Teves, and half of Shevat. @d1The end of the summer is more severe than the summer. @boThis is because people are still cool all summer, due to the winter’s cold. But at the end of summer they heat up. That is why summer’s end is more severe than its middle. [And according to the @ITRe’m, @itwe can say that] the cold season is more severe than winter for a similar reason. Rashi writes in Bava Metzia 106b that winter is “the most chilly part of the fall season; the days of cold.” If so, how could Rashi say here that the cold season is more severe than winter? Perforce, it is the way we explained. And so it is implied by the @ITRe’m@it as well. @d1.<TIE>.<TIE>.During all the days of the Flood@bo. I.e., all twelve months of the Flood. The @ITRe’m@it asks: But how will we explain [verse (8:13), “.<TIE>.<TIE>.He looked, and behold the surface of the ground had dried”]? How could Noach see on the first of Tishrei that the water had dried, if this was during the twelve months [when there was no light]? Furthermore, how could he count the days? For it says (v. 6): “At the end of forty days, Noach opened the window of the ark.” Also (v. 8), “[After 7 days] he sent the dove.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Furthermore, how did the dove fly without light, and how could it see if there was a place to rest? Furthermore, how did the window benefit the ark, if there was no light? The @ITRe’m@it left the issue unresolved. @d1The constellations did not function@bo. Although the verse speaks of the six seasons as well, Rashi explains specifically that the constellations ceased functioning — rather than that the seasons ceased — since the seasons obviously depend on the earth’s existence, but the water covered the surface of the earth, [so the seasons obviously ceased]. Thus Rashi explained that even day and night ceased, although they do not depend on the earth’s existence. This was due to the constellations not functioning. It seems the answer is: The constellations “not functioning” means the heavenly spheres did not move. There were no normal daily twelve hours of daylight and twelve hours of darkness. Rather, during all twelve months, one half of the globe had light while the other had darkness — as at the beginning of Creation, before the luminaries were placed in their orbits. And when Noach entered the ark, the sun was shining, as it is written (7:13), “On that very @ITday@it.<TIE>.<TIE>.” This is why the Midrash says, “The constellations did not @ITfunction@it,” rather than saying, “The constellations did not give light.” They gave light, but they did not alternate in their normal daily manner of day and night. And when Rashi says, “Night and day were indistinguishable,” it means that in one place it was always daytime, and in another, darkness. And the earth’s surface dried up from the sun’s heat since it shone on the earth even during these twelve months. This resolves [almost] all the @ITRe’m’s@it questions. As for his question, “How could he count the days?” perhaps Noach knew the days by measuring the passage of time, as the @ITAkeidah@it explains in Parshas Bereishis, or through a sun dial. For the sun would shine through the ark’s window. Noach made the window for a purpose, so he would not dwell in darkness, according to the opinion that @hh<HEB>צהר@ee<ENG> means window. Or, [Noach counted the days] by observing the animals, as it says in Berachos 3a: “In the first watch the donkey brays.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Or, by observing the ravens or roosters, according the opinion that @hh<HEB>הנותן לשכוי בינה להבחין בין יום ובין לילה@ee<ENG> [refers to the rooster]. Or, by observing a special stone or by some other means. Similarly it was asked about Moshe Rabbeinu, “How did he know when it was day and night [when he was in heaven for forty days]?” May Hashem show us the wonders of His Torah. @d1None of them shall cease@bo. Rashi is saying that we should not understand @hh<HEB>ישבותו@ee<ENG> to mean resting. For “rest” can be said only about the performer of the activity, not about the activity itself. Thus for the seasons, we cannot say that they “rested.” We could say only that Hashem rested, as He performs the activity. That is why Rashi explains@hh<HEB>ישבותו @ee<ENG> to mean cessation.<QC>
@p1[3]@p2 “I did not permit@bo.<TIE>.<TIE>. The reason why Noach was permitted to eat meat, while Adam was not, seems to be as follows: Previously, men and animals were equal in that they all were Hashem’s creations. He formed them all from the earth; none had higher status than the other [as regards their bodies]. Why should one kill the other? But when they sinned, all should have been destroyed, and they survived only in Noach’s merit. This gave Noach a higher status than the animals. (@ITKitzur Mizrachi@it) Scripture connected the permission to eat meat to that of eating vegetables so we will not say that meat is now permitted @ITinstead@it of vegetables, and vegetables are no longer permitted. Thus Scripture tells us that eating meat is in @ITaddition@it to eating vegetables. (@ITDivrei Dovid@it) @p1[4]@p2 Literally meaning: while the “soul” [life] is within its blood@bo. The @ITRe’m@it writes: I have found this correct version of Rashi: With its life — “while it is still alive.” You shall not eat — “this refers to limbs from a living animal.” While the life is in its blood you shall not eat — “this refers to blood of a living animal.” [Accordingly,] the @hh<HEB>ב@ee<ENG> of @hh<HEB>בנפשו@ee<ENG> means “with,” as if it said: “Flesh, @ITwhile it is with@it life, you shall not eat.” And the Sages learned from the extra word @hh<HEB>דמו@ee<ENG> that the word @hh<HEB>בנפשו@ee<ENG> should be read with the preceding word, @hh<HEB>בשר@ee<ENG>, and also the following word, @hh<HEB>דמו@ee<ENG>. Thus: “@hh<HEB>בשר בנפשו@ee<ENG> — You shall not eat flesh with its life.” And also: “@hh<HEB>בנפשו דמו@ee<ENG> — You shall not eat its blood with its life.” The verse is thus telling us not to eat the flesh or the blood of an animal that is still alive. Rashi said @hh<HEB>בעוד נפשו בו@ee<ENG>, rather than [staying closer to] the wording of the verse and saying @hh<HEB>בשר עם נפשו@ee<ENG>, which would express the verse’s simple meaning. This was because the latter expression implies that the prohibition is on eating the blood and the meat together. Thus Rashi explained that @hh<HEB>בנפשו@ee<ENG> means [not to eat the meat @ITor@it the blood] while the life is still in the animal. Question: A limb from a living animal had been prohibited to Adam, so [why was it repeated to Noach?] The answer is: Since Noach was now permitted to eat meat, we might think he was permitted to eat the limb from a living animal as well. Therefore, Scripture tells us that the previous prohibition stands. (@ITDivrei Dovid@it)<QC>
@p1[5]@p2 From one who spills his own blood.@p3 [Rashi know this] because if it refers to spilling another's blood, this was already mentioned: @hh<HEB>ומיד האדם@hh@ee<ENG>.

@p1[7]@p2 Plain explanation, the first is@bo.<TIE>.<TIE>. Rashi holds that, “Elohim said to them, ‘Be fruitful and multiply’” (1:28), comes to explain [the preceding blessing of], “Elohim blessed them” (ibid.). And so it is with the verse for Noach and his descendants. “He said to them, ‘Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth’” (9:1) comes to explain [the preceding blessing of], “Elohim blessed Noach and his sons” (ibid.). However, the mitzvah to propagate is learned only from the verse, “And now be fruitful and multiply,” because no term of blessing is mentioned here. (@ITKitzur Mizrachi@it) @p1[9]@p2 Hashem did so eventually@bo.<TIE>.<TIE>. Meaning, Hashem did so a second time. Although Hashem had already promised Noach, he was still concerned. For Hashem’s promises are conditional: if they fulfill His will [and do not sin as the generation of the Flood did,] He will keep His promise; and if not, not. Therefore Noach was concerned, until Hashem promised him again that He would never bring another Flood. This also explains why Noach was commanded to have children. For even though Adam had already been commanded — Hashem needed to command Noach again because Noach was concerned. We need not ask: Why was Noach concerned? Hashem already swore He would never again smite mankind! As Rashi explained (8:21), “Never again, never again” serves as an oath. The answer is: It says (ibid), “And Adonoy said @ITin His heart@it, ‘Never again.<TIE>.<TIE>.’” I.e., Hashem thought this [oath], but Noach knew nothing of it. (@ITRe’m@it) It seems that Rashi deduced [that Noach was concerned] from the fact that Noach was permitted marital relations when he left the ark, as it says (8:16), “Depart from the ark, yourself and your wife” — yet he did not engage in relations. Rather, they left in separation (ibid v. 18): “Noach departed from the ark together with his sons, his wife and son’s wives.” So we see that Noach did not wish to have children. Therefore Hashem said, “I agree with you.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it)<QC>

(@ITMaharshal@it) @d1That is with you. @bo[You might ask:] Why does Rashi reverse the order and explain “that is with you,” which comes first in the verse, at the end? [The answer is:] It is all part of the same comment [as it appears in our version of Rashi], as follows: Beasts of the earth — [These] include the dangerous animals that are not included in “Every living creature that is with you,” [i.e.,] that they do not walk among people. @p1[11]@p2 “I will @BIconfirm@bi My covenant.”@bo Rashi is answering the question: Is it not already written (v. 9), @hh<HEB>ואני הנני מקים את בריתי@ee<ENG>, “I am making a covenant with you”?<QC>
@p1[12]@p2 That did not require a sign@bo. You might ask: How does the incomplete form imply this exegesis? It seems the answer is: When the generations are incomplete — wicked — they need the rainbow as a sign, but not when they are complete, i.e., righteous, they do not need the rainbow as a sign. Another answer: Since @hh<HEB>דרת@ee<ENG> is written in an incomplete form, it can be read @hh<HEB>דָרַת@ee<ENG> — “dweller,” in the singular. Thus, @hh<HEB>לדרת עולם@ee<ENG> connotes “for a certain dweller in the world.” The verse is saying: “For certain families that dwell in the world, I have set My rainbow in the clouds.” Yet, [we ask,] is not the rainbow for all? Perforce, “There are some generations that did not require a sign.<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (@ITRe’m@it) The @ITMaharshal@it explains: If it were written complete, we would understand that all generations for all time require the sign. Now that it is written incomplete, it implies the generations that [dwell in] this world [only], require a sign. However, those generations which dwell in this world and are destined for the World to Come, do not require a sign.<QC>
@p1[14]@p2 To bring darkness@bo.<TIE>.<TIE>. Rashi holds that “When I bring clouds” does not means actual clouds, rather: “If you are deserving of a Flood, and it enters My mind to bring darkness and destruction to the world, then the rainbow will be seen in the ‘clouds’ [i.e., the darkness] and I shall remember My covenant.” [And therefore,] “Never again will flood waters destroy all flesh.” But if the verse meant actual clouds, why then would it say, “Never again will flood waters destroy all flesh,” [implying that if not for the rainbow, they would be punished]? Why should they be deserving of a Flood just because there are clouds over the earth? [Alternatively,] it seems that Rashi knew this because it is written, “Clouds over the @ITearth@it,” connecting the clouds to the earth. But in fact, clouds are not connected to the earth! It should say, “When I bring clouds in the @ITheavens@it.” Thus Rashi explains that it is not actual clouds, rather “darkness and destruction” regarding the world. (@ITR. Meir Stern@it)<QC>
@p1[20]@p2 He made himself profane [@HB<HEB>חולין@BO<ENG>]@bo. Otherwise, why does it say @hh<HEB>ויחל@ee<ENG>? It should simply say, “He planted a vineyard.” (@ITKitzur Mizrachi@it) @d1As in “Naomi’s master.”@bo We cannot say it means Naomi’s husband, because a husband does not belong to his wife in the way a wife belongs to her husband. We do not say @hh<HEB>איש אשה@ee<ENG> (a man belonging to a wife) like we say @hh<HEB>אשת איש@ee<ENG> (a woman belonging to a husband). The construct form, @hh<HEB>אשת איש@ee<ENG>, indicates “belonging to.” (@ITKitzur Mizrachi@it) @d1Vine branches and fig shoots@bo. You might ask: How does Rashi know he brought with him fig shoots? Granted that he brought vine branches, for it says @hh<HEB>ויטע כרם@ee<ENG>, and @hh<HEB>נטיעה@ee<ENG> denotes planting branches. For when seeds are used, it is not called @hh<HEB>נטיעה@ee<ENG>, [rather @hh<HEB>זריעה@ee<ENG>]. But how does Rashi know about fig shoots? R. Isserel answers in his commentary: Since Noach “should have first been occupied with another @hh<HEB>נטיעה@ee<ENG>,” as learned from @hh<HEB>ויחל@ee<ENG>, he must have had some other branch to plant! Although we do not know which other species he had, we do know that until this point, the Torah has mentioned no species of trees other than figs. For it is written in Parshas Bereishis (3:7): “They sewed together fig leaves.” Thus we may infer that Noach had fig shoots. But it seems to me [that Rashi knew Noach had fig shoots because] Noach’s son Cham castrated him in order that Noach should not have a fourth son (see Rashi 9:25). But how did Cham know he wanted to have another son? Because he planted trees whose fruit bring physical desire. And there is no fruit that brings desire like figs. For it is written in Sanhedrin 70b that the tree from which Adam was a fig tree, as it says, “They sewed together fig leaves, etc.” They set themselves aright with what they had sinned. And the fig tree brought upon Adam additional physical desire, for it says (4:25), “Adam knew his wife again.” And Rashi explains: “His desire for her was greater than before.” This explains why Rashi said that Noach brought vine branches and fig shoots into the ark. The @ITRe’m@it answers differently, citing R. Yaakov of Orleans: [Noach brought these species] because vines and figs are more easily damaged by water. Thus Noach chose to bring them into the ark over other trees, and therefore he needed to bring in the actual branches, [not just the seeds]. @p1[21]@p2 Referred to as @BIShomron@bi. In Yechezkel (23:4) it says, “And they bore sons and daughters, and their names: Shomron is Oholah (@hh<HEB>אהלה@ee<ENG>)<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” And here since it is written @hh<HEB>אהלה@ee<ENG> instead of @hh<HEB>אהלו@ee<ENG>, to hint to Shomron’s exile (which was due to wine). This also explains the expression @hh<HEB>ויתגל@ee<ENG>, which is related to @hh<HEB>גלות@ee<ENG> (exile). (@ITKitzur Mizrachi@it)<QC>
@p1[22]@p2 Some of our Sages say, he castrated him. Others say, he sodomized him. @boI will explain this a little later (v. 25, @hh<HEB>ד"ה אתה גרמת לי@ee<ENG>), with Hashem’s help. @p1[23]@p2 And their backsides bare@bo. @hh<HEB>חשופי@ee<ENG> means exposed and @hh<HEB>שת@ee<ENG> means loins, so it is saying their loins were exposed since they were naked and had no clothing to cover themselves. But Yefes, who covered [his father’s nakedness], merited a covering for himself: burial. And Sheim who exerted himself more for the mitzvah — and covered Noach with a cloak — merited a tallis with tzitzis. [You might ask:] It says in Maseches Sotah 17a that Avraham’s descendants were rewarded with @ITtecheiles @itstrings and tefillin straps for his saying [to the King of Sedom], “Neither a thread nor a shoelace” (14:23). Does this not imply that the mitzvah of tzitzis was given to Avraham for saying, “Neither a thread,” rather than for Sheim’s covering his father? The answer is: A tallis with tzitzis is one thing, and @ITtecheiles @itis another. Due to Sheim, they merited a tallis with white tzitzis strings. And due to what Avraham said, they merited @ITtecheiles@it. (@ITRe’m@it) @p1[24]@p2 The worthless and contemptible one@bo. [Rashi knows this] because otherwise why does it call Cham @hh<HEB>קטן@ee<ENG>? He was older than Yefes, for Scripture (5:32) counts him before Yefes. And we cannot say Cham was counted before Yefes because of his importance, although Rashi writes (ibid.) that Sheim was counted first of all due to his importance. For Cham was the lowliest of them all. (@ITRe’m@it) But the @ITMaharshal@it [writes that the @ITRe’m @itwas mistaken, and Cham surely was not older than Yefes. He] explains that Rashi is rather answering the question: [Why is Cham called @hh<HEB>קטן@ee<ENG>?] Sheim was the youngest! For it is written (ibid.), “Noach was 500 years old, and Noach produced Sheim, Cham, and Yafes.” And it is written (7:6), “Noach was 600 years old when the flood waters were on the earth,” [thus his oldest child was then 100]. Additionally, it is written (11:10): “Sheim was 100 years old.<TIE>.<TIE>. two years after the Flood.” Since Sheim was born when his father was 502, he [was not the oldest. Rather he] was the youngest son, [for if Cham was youngest, then in 5:32 the order should be: “Shem, Yefes, and Cham.” See entry there, citing @ITMaharshal@it.]<QC>
@p1[25]@p2 You caused me@bo. This is proof for those who say Cham castrated Noach. For it is written, “Cursed is Canaan.” Why did Noach curse Canaan? Because Cham castrated Noach, who then said, “You caused me.<TIE>.<TIE>. may @ITyour @itfourth son.<TIE>.<TIE>.” And the proof for those who say he sodomized him is from (9:22): “Cham the father of Canaan @ITsaw@it.” And it is written (34:2): “She was @ITseen@it by Shechem.” Just as there, Shechem had relations, so too here, Cham had relations. If so, why did Noach curse Canaan? Because Cham did both: he sodomized him and castrated him. Tosafos explain in Sanhedrin 70a that the reason Noach did not curse Cham himself is because it is written (9:1), “Elohim blessed Noach and his sons.” And a curse cannot be effectuated where there is a blessing. (@ITMaharshal@it) @d1Why did Cham.<TIE>.<TIE>. @boYou might ask: How did Cham know that Noach desired a fourth son? The answer is: It is written, “He uncovered himself (@hh<HEB>ויתגל@ee<ENG>) in his tent (@hh<HEB>אהלה@ee<ENG>).” It is read @hh<HEB>אהלו@ee<ENG> (his tent) but is written @hh<HEB>אהלה@ee<ENG> (her tent). And Rashi explained there that .<TIE>.<TIE>. @hh<HEB>ויתגל@ee<ENG> is the reflexive form. Thus, the verse is saying that Noach acted with himself [“reflexive”] as if he was engaged in relations with his wife [“her tent”]. I.e., his organ had the requisite hardness as if he was engaged in relations. Cham thereby recognized that Noach desired a fourth son. See the other answer I wrote on v. 20 (@hh<HEB>ד"ה זמורות וייחורי תאנים@ee<ENG>); both are good.<QC>
@p1[26]@p2 His promise to his seed@bo. The verse is explained as referring to Sheim’s seed, rather than to Sheim himself, because it is written: “May Canaan be their (@hh<HEB>למו@ee<ENG>) slave.” If it referred to Sheim himself, it should say, “May Canaan be his (@hh<HEB>לו@ee<ENG>) slave.” Alternatively, it must refer to Sheim’s seed because it is written, “Elokei [God of] Sheim,” and Scripture does not say “Elokeif” regarding an individual. Hashem places His Name only on a nation, such as “Elokei Yisrael” or “Elokei the Hebrews.” (@ITKitzur Mizrachi@it) @p1[27]@p2 Even after.<TIE>.<TIE>. will be exiled@bo. [Rashi knows this] because if it referred to the time when they ruled, it is already written, “Blessed is Adonoy, Elokei Sheim; may Canaan be his slave.” Why does it say a second time, “Canaan will be their slave”? Perforce, it means even in exile. You might ask: [Perhaps it means Canaan will be a slave] for Yefes? [The answer is:] If so, it should say, “Elohim will enlarge Yefes, and Canaan will be their slave.” And only then it should say, “But He will dwell in the tents of Sheim.” Perforce, it means even in exile. @p1[2]@p2 This refers to Persia@bo. You might ask: Why does Rashi explain Tiras any more than the others? The answer is: Rashi said on 9:27 (@hh<HEB>ד"ה וישכון@ee<ENG>) that “Cyrus, Yefes’ descendant, built the Second Temple.” And one might ask: How does Rashi know that Cyrus came from Yefes? Thus Rashi explains here that Tiras is Persia, so Persia is from Yefes. And Cyrus, king of Persia, assumedly descended from Tiras. Furthermore, the @ITRe’m@it says that Rashi [explains Tiras because he] is answering the question: Why here is it written @hh<HEB>מדי@ee<ENG>, not @hh<HEB>פרס@ee<ENG>? These two nations are always mentioned together! Thus Rashi explains that Tiras is @hh<HEB>פרס@ee<ENG>. But @ITTzeidah L’Derech@it says that [it is not as the @ITRe’m @itsaid. Rather, Rashi explains Tiras because] it is from Yoma 10a: “How do we know that the Persians come from Yefes? Because it is written, ‘The sons of Yefes were: Gomer.<TIE>.<TIE>. and Tiras.’ And Rav Yosef taught: Tiras is Persia.” [Thus, Rashi brings it to prove that Cyrus came from Yefes.]<QC>
@p1[8]@p2 In causing the entire world to rebel@bo. [Rashi explains @hh<HEB>החל@ee<ENG> as “rebel”] because otherwise, [if it meant “began,”] why should it say @hh<HEB>החל@ee<ENG>? Nimrod was not the first to rebel against Hashem. Back in the days of Enosh it already says (4:26), @hh<HEB>אז @hhהוחל@hh לקרא@ee<ENG>. Perforce, @hh<HEB>החל@ee<ENG> is related to the word @hh<HEB>חילול@ee<ENG>. I.e., Nimrod publicly desecrated Hashem’s Name [by rebelling against Him]. (@ITKitzur Mizrachi@it) But it seems to me that @hh<HEB>החל@ee<ENG> must mean “began”. For if meant “rebel”, why does it say [@hh<HEB>גבור@ee<ENG>] twice? It should [combine the verses and] say, @hh<HEB>הוא החל להיות גבור ציד לפני ה'@ee<ENG>. But if it means “began,” the verse is understandable as is. Scripture is saying: “He was the first one who began to be powerful in causing rebellion, and he was a mighty hunter before Hashem, intentionally provoking Him.” (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it)<QC>
@p1[9]@p2 He intentionally provoked Him.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Wherever Nimrod is, he is “before Hashem.” [So what is the meaning of “before Hashem”?] @p1[12]@p2 This refers to Nineveh@bo. [Rashi explains this] because we do not know if “the great city” refers to Nineveh or to Kalach. [And Rashi knows it is Nineveh] because if Kalach was “the great city,” it should say, @hh<HEB>ובין כלח העיר הגדולה@ee<ENG>. Why does it say @hh<HEB>היא@ee<ENG>? (@ITNachalas Yaakov,@it citing Tosfos Yoma 10a, @hh<HEB>ד"ה איני@ee<ENG>) @p1[13]@p2 Because of their fiery faces@bo. Wherever the name is a Hebrew word, Rashi explains why that name is used, telling us what it signifies. But if the name is not a Hebrew word, Rashi does not comment. @p1[14]@p2 And the Plishtim descended from them@bo. For if the Plishtim descended from the Kasluchim alone, it should say: “And the Kasluchim produced the Plishtim,” and omit, “From whom came.” Furthermore, Scripture cannot be identifying which Kasluchim it speaks of — i.e., they are the ones from which the Plishtim came — as no other mention of Kasluchim appears in Scripture. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1[18]@p2 Many families@bo. @hh<HEB>ואחר נפצו@ee<ENG> cannot refer to the above-mentioned descendants of Canaan, [saying that they spread across the earth,] for then it should say just @hh<HEB>ואחר נפצו@ee<ENG> and omit @hh<HEB>משפחות הכנעני@ee<ENG>. For it clearly would refer back to those above. Perforce, it says @hh<HEB>משפחות הכנעני@ee<ENG> to tell us that “from these, many other families branched out.” This is similar to Noach’s three sons [from whom many families branched out]. (@ITRe’m@it) @p1[21]@p2 Of the river@bo. The simple reading of the verse is that Eiver is the name of a man [who was a greatgrandson of Sheim]. But if so, why does it say that Sheim was “father of the children of Eiver”? Was Sheim the forefather only of Eiver’s descendants? Sheim had other sons as well! Thus Rashi explains that Eiver is not a name of a person, but it means @hh<HEB>עבר הנהר@ee<ENG>, the other side of the river. This is preferable to the @ITRe’m’s @itexplanation, that it cannot refer to Eiver the great-grandson of Sheim because then what would it come to teach us? Everyone is the forefather of the families he produced! Perforce, @hh<HEB>עבר@ee<ENG> means the other side of the river. @d1Consequently, his oldest child was 100 years old@bo. [The @ITRe’m, @itwho holds that Cham was the oldest son of Noach (see entry on 9:24, citing @ITRe’m@it) writes as follows:] You might ask: How does this prove [that Yefes was older than Sheim]? Perhaps Cham was 100 years old when the Flood came, Sheim was 100 at two years after the Flood, and Yefes was 100 at three or four years after the Flood. The answer is: In the early generations, sons were born at intervals of one year, as it says in Sanhedrin 69b. Once Scripture tells us that Sheim was born when Noach was 502, which is [deduced from the fact that Sheim turned 100] “two years after the Flood,” we may infer that Sheim was the last [to be born. This is because “Noach was 500 years old when he had his first child.” [We may therefore deduce that] Yefes was born when Noach was 501, and Cham was born when Noach was 500.<QC>
@p1[25]@p2 Towards the end of Eiver’s life they became dispersed@bo. If so, how did Eiver know [to name his son Peleg]? Perforce, he was a prophet. @d1Early in his life@bo. And thus Eiver was not a prophet. Perhaps, the dispersion happened early on, and he named [his son Peleg] after a past event. [This is not so,] because “Yokton.<TIE>.<TIE>. had propagated many families before this.” @d1And if you will claim that [the dispersion took place] in his mid-life. @boMeaning: Peleg had a different name before the dispersion, and when it occurred, Eiver renamed him. [To this Rashi counters:] “Scripture does not come to obfuscate, but to clarify. Hence, you may conclude that in the year of Peleg’s death they were dispersed.” This eliminates the possibility that Peleg had another name beforehand, and Eiver renamed him after the dispersion occurred. For it occurred at the end of Peleg’s life, and a deceased person is not renamed on account of an event that took place at the time of or shortly before his death. Surely, Eiver named him Peleg early in Eiver’s life, on account of a future event. @d1And thought little of himself@bo. Rashi is answering the question: Why does Scripture change the style of its text when telling about the birth of Eiver’s sons? For it is written: “Two sons were born to Eiver.” This is unlike other births, where it says, for instance, “Arpachshad produced Shelach,” and, “Yaktan produced Almodad, Shelef.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Perforce Scripture changed the style of its text and writes, “Two sons were born to Eiver,” [because] he named them on account of an event. But the question is: Indeed, Scripture gave a reason for naming Peleg so. But why was Yaktan named so? It must be because he thought little of himself. Eiver saw all this prophetically. But the @ITRe’m @itwrites that Rashi specially explains Yaktan because it is derived from @hh<HEB>קטן@ee<ENG> [which is a Hebrew word]. @d1He was so called because of his city@bo. [The Aggadah explains that] the people of that city awaited death [@hh<HEB>מות@ee<ENG>] every day, because they [were very poor] and ate animal fodder.<QC>
@p1[1]@p2 The holy language. @boFor if it was another language, there would not be only one language [on earth, as the holy language remained until this point.]. For all agree that the world was created with the holy language, as Rashi explained on (2:23): “The man said, ‘This at last.<TIE>.<TIE>. shall be called @hh<HEB>אשה@ee<ENG>.’” @d1Another explanation: Against the Sole Being of the universe. @boThere is a question on the first explanation: Why does it not say @hb<HEB>ב@hhדברים אחדים@ee<ENG> (@ITwith@it conforming words)? Thus Rashi says, “Another explanation.<TIE>.<TIE>.” But this answer also raises a difficulty: Why does it not say @hh<HEB>ודברים אחרים@ee<ENG> (and @ITother@it words)? Thus Rashi offers the third explanation, which interprets @hh<HEB>דברים אחדים@ee<ENG> to mean @hh<HEB>דברים חדים@ee<ENG> (sharp words). (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1[2]@p2 Where they resided@bo. Rashi is answering the question: There is no city or place called @hh<HEB>קדם@ee<ENG>. [So why does it say they journeyed from there?] Earlier (10:30), it mentions @hh<HEB>קדם@ee<ENG> only to mark the place of Meisha, which was by Sephor, towards the east (@hh<HEB>קדם@ee<ENG>). Thus Rashi explains that they resided there, i.e., in the city of Meisha. But not in @hh<HEB>קדם@ee<ENG>, which merely marks the location. Then Rashi answers the question: Why does it not say @hh<HEB>ויסעו מקדם@ee<ENG>? For @hh<HEB>בנסעם@ee<ENG> implies they found the valley at the very start of their journey, which cannot be. Thus Rashi explains, “They journeyed from there @ITto seek@it for themselves.<TIE>.<TIE>.” [I.e., they were @ITseeking@it from the very start.] (@ITthe author@it) @d1They journeyed from there.<TIE>.<TIE>. @boRashi knew they journeyed for this purpose because it is written afterwards, “They @ITfound@it a valley,” implying that from the start they were looking for it. @p1[3]@p2 One nation to another@bo. Rashi knows this because it is written later (v. 7), “And jumble their language that they will not understand @hh<HEB>איש שפת רעהו"@ee<ENG>.” There, it must mean one nation understanding another, for if it meant individuals, there would be more than seventy languages! And that verse refers back to our verse, @hh<HEB>ויאמרו איש אל רעהו@ee<ENG>. Thus we learn that in our verse, too, it means “one nation to another.” This is preferable to @ITRe’m’s @itexplanation that the plan was made between nations rather than between individuals.<QC>
@p1[4]@p2 To scatter us from here@bo. This refers back to “city,” not to “tower.” [I.e., they built the @ITcity@it in order not to be scattered.] Otherwise it would contradict what Rashi explained on 11:1, that they built the tower to rebel against Hashem, whereas Rashi explains here, “So that He will not bring some plague.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Perforce, the @ITcity@it was built in order not to be scattered [by some plague]. (@ITRe’m@it) But @ITGur Aryeh @itwrites that “not be scattered” was indeed the reason for the tower. [They reasoned that] if He will bring some plague to scatter them, they will ascend the tower to wage war against Hashem. Similarly with Rashi’s second explanation there, “To make supports for the heavens.” [It was so that Hashem would not bring a Flood upon them to scatter them].<QC>
@p1[6]@p2 As in @HB<HEB>אמרם עשותם@BO<ENG>. @boMeaning: @hh<HEB>החל@ee<ENG> is the root, and the suffix [of @hh<HEB>ם@ee<ENG>] denotes the subject [of the verb], like @hh<HEB>אמרם@ee<ENG> means@hh<HEB>אמר הם @ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>עשותם@ee<ENG> means @hh<HEB>עשות הם@ee<ENG>. Here as well, @hh<HEB>החלם@ee<ENG> means @hh<HEB>החל הם@ee<ENG>. @d1An incredulous question@bo. Meaning: Shall they not be prevented from this plan? Behold, we will descend and jumble their language, and this idea surely will be stopped! But this phrase cannot be a statement of fact, for they indeed were stopped. Question: Why should they be unstoppable [if not for Hashem’s intervention]? The answer is: Peace has great power. For even if [the Jews] worship idols they are not punished [if they have peace among themselves], as it says (Hoshea 4:17), “Ephraim is joined to idols; let him alone.” But Hashem countered: Their power of peace will not help them, as they can be brought to fight and argue. (@ITDivrei Dovid@it)<QC>
@p1[7]@p2 Measure in kind@bo. [Rashi knows it means this] because if not, why does it say @hh<HEB>הבה@ee<ENG>, which means “prepare yourselves” [see Rashi on v. 3]? As regards Hashem, everything is already prepared! (@ITGur Aryeh@it) @d1The letter @HB<HEB>ה@BO<ENG> at the end is superfluous. @boRashi means that since it is written @hh<HEB>ונבלה@ee<ENG> rather than @hh<HEB>ונבל@ee<ENG>, we might think it is not plural — rather it is like @hh<HEB>נָפְלָה@ee<ENG>, which starts with a @hh<HEB>נ@ee<ENG> and is not plural. There, the @hh<HEB>נ@ee<ENG> is the first letter of the root, and the @hh<HEB>ה@ee<ENG> makes it feminine. The @hh<HEB>נ@ee<ENG> is not a plural prefix. And we might say the same for @hh<HEB>ונבלה@ee<ENG>. Thus Rashi explains, “The letter @hh<HEB>ה@ee<ENG> at the end is superfluous.” In other words, @hh<HEB>ונבלה@ee<ENG> is unlike @hh<HEB>נָפְלָה@ee<ENG> [where the @hh<HEB>ה@ee<ENG> is to make it feminine]. Rather, @hh<HEB>ונבלה@ee<ENG> is the same as @hh<HEB>ונבל@ee<ENG>, which is [first person] plural. And v. 9 proves that the @hh<HEB>נ@ee<ENG> of @hh<HEB>ונבלה@ee<ENG> is a plural prefix, for it is written afterward, “Adonoy jumbled (@hh<HEB>בלל@ee<ENG>).<TIE>.<TIE>.” Thus we see that the @hh<HEB>נ@ee<ENG> of @hh<HEB>ונבלה@ee<ENG> is not the first letter of the root, [because the root is @hh<HEB>בלל@ee<ENG>]. Rather, it is a plural prefix. This is preferable to the explanation of @ITRe’m, @it[who writes that we might think the @hh<HEB>נ@ee<ENG> of @hh<HEB>ונבלה@ee<ENG> is from the passive verb form @hh<HEB>נפעל@ee<ENG>. The @ITRe’m @itargues that if so,] the verse would be difficult to understand, because it would be saying: “Let us descend and their language will be jumbled.” Their language would not be jumbled due to Hashem’s descending!<QC>
@d1And splits his brains open@bo. For if they stopped building simply because one could not understand the other, why did they scatter? They could live together despite not understanding one another. It must be that they started fighting. (@ITGur Aryeh@it)<QC>
@p1[10]@p2 Two years after the flood@bo. Rashi is explaining that, “Two years after the flood” refers to, “He begat Arpachshad,” and also to, “Sheim was 100 years old.”<QC>
@p1[28]@p2 The Midrash Aggadah@bo. Rashi [offers the Midrashic explanation] because of a question on the simple meaning: What does it matter to us whether Haran died during Terach’s lifetime or after his death? Whereas according to the Midrash Aggadah, it teaches us the miracle of Avraham being saved while Haran was burnt [to death].<QC>
@p1[29]@p2 This was Sarah@bo. You might ask: How does Rashi know this? Furthermore: What does it matter that Yiskah is Sarah? The answer is: Rashi knows this because before it is written that Haran was “the father of Milkah and Yiskah,” and it lists Haran’s [female] offspring. If so, why does it not mention Sarah as well, who was a daughter of Haran? Perforce, Yiskah is Sarah. Furthermore, Sarah is @hh<HEB>בג"ץ@ee<ENG> in the @ITalef beis@it of@hh<HEB>א"ת ב"ש @ee<ENG>, [in which @hh<HEB>א@ee<ENG> equals @hh<HEB>ת@ee<ENG>, and @hh<HEB>ב@ee<ENG> equals @hh<HEB>ש@ee<ENG>, etc]. And @hh<HEB>בג"ץ@ee<ENG> has the same numerical value as @hh<HEB>יסכה@ee<ENG>. Rashi offers three explanations for the name Yiskah because [the name hints to all of them, so] which one should be ruled out? Alternatively, it is because Sanhedrin 69b mentions two of them. And Rashi added a third, “princely”, because he is answering the question: Why was she not called by her actual name, @hh<HEB>שרי@ee<ENG>? It must be that @hh<HEB>יסכה@ee<ENG> means “princely,” and is thus similar to @hh<HEB>שרי@ee<ENG>, which means “ruling”. (@ITsource unknown@it) @p1[31]@p2 Terach and Avram went forth@bo. [Theoretically,] it could be the other way around: Lot and Sarai went forth, bringing along Terach and Avram. Thus, Rashi is telling us that Terach and Avram were primary while Sarai and Lot were secondary. But if so, why is it written before: “Terach took his son Avram.<TIE>.<TIE>.” implying that Terach [alone] took them out, while here it implies that also Avram took them out? The answer is: Also Avram took them out. Nevertheless, he accorded the honor to his father as if his father alone took them out, which is why it is written, “Terach took.<TIE>.<TIE>.” And if not for, “With them @ITthey@it departed,” we would assume that in truth, Terach alone took them out. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1[32]@p2 [People] would say, “[Avraham] did not show.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @boThe @ITRe’m@it writes: I do not understand about which time period Rashi is concerned [that “people would say”]. If it is referring to Avraham’s time period, what does it help that “Scripture refers to him as dead”? The Torah was not written in Avraham’s days! And if it is referring to the time period after the Torah had been written, why would people say Avraham “did not show respect for his father”? The next verse says, “Adonoy said to Avram, ‘Go from your land.<TIE>.<TIE>.’” Obviously, Avraham could not stay with his father and disobey Hashem’s command! It seems the answer is: It is after the Torah was written. And they would say Avraham did not respect his father because he did not take his father with him to Canaan as he did when he left Ur Kasdim. But in fact Avraham did not take his father along because his father was wicked and worshipped idols. Although Terach repented before he died, Avraham left him in Charan when he was still wicked. But it seems to me that [he who answered this] did not understand the @ITRe’m@it. The whole reason Hashem said to Avraham, “Go from your land.<TIE>.<TIE>. and from @ITyour father’s house@it” was because He did not want Avraham to take his father with him! Hashem did not want Avraham to make himself secondary to his father as he did in the first journey, where it is written, “Terach took his son Avram.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Moreover, it is not true that Avraham took his father along when he left Ur Kasdim. On the contrary, Terach took Avraham, as we explained above. Thus, the @ITRe’m’s @itquestion stands. (@ITTzeidah L’Derech@it) See what I cited above (v. 31) from the @ITNachalas Yaakov@it, and you will find a good reply to this rebuttal. [For the @ITNachalas Yaakov @itproves that Avraham did not truly make himself secondary to his father; he merely accorded honor to his father.]<QC>
@p1[1]@p2<TIE>It is there that I will make you into a great nation@p3. Rashi is explaining his comment of above: “For your own benefit, for your own good.” What is the good? “I will make you into a great nation.” And what is the benefit? “I will make your character known to the world.” Since the next verse elaborates by saying, “I will make you into a great nation .<TIE>.<TIE>. and make your name great,” we learn that it was for this purpose that Hashem told Avraham to go there. The [repetitive phrase] @hh<HEB>לך לך@ee<ENG> does not present a difficulty, for [similarly] it is written in Shir HaShirim 2:11: @hh<HEB>הגשם חלף הלך לו@ee<ENG>. Thus we could explain the phrase @hh<HEB>לך לך@ee<ENG> is common in Scripture. Nevertheless we explain [such a phrase] where possible, [as Rashi does here]. So wrote @ITRe’m@it, but it seems to me that it indeed presents a difficulty everywhere it appears. With @hh<HEB>הגשם חלף הלך לו@ee<ENG>, it means that the rain ceased, following its nature and inclination. But here, Hashem told Avraham to “Go from your land” against his will, [so that explanation does not fit]. Thus Rashi explains, “For your benefit<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” The @ITMaharshal@it writes: There is a difficulty with Rashi’s first explanation, [“It is there that I will make you into a great nation.” For in v. 2,] we need to insert the phrase, “@ITIt is there that.@it” Thus Rashi offers the second explanation, “I will make your character known to the world.” But according to this explanation, a question arises: What is meant by (v. 2), “I will make you into a great nation”? Therefore, Rashi needs both explanations.<QC>
@p1[2]@p2<TIE>Since traveling causes three things@p3. Rashi is answering the question: Why did Hashem give Avraham these three specific blessings, and not other blessings? @BOTherefore, these three blessings were necessary@bo. Question: How did these three things that are diminished by traveling pertain to Avraham? He had no children. Also, he had no wealth, for on his way [down to Egypt] he bought everything on credit [see Rashi on 13:3]. Furthermore, he replied to the King of Sedom (14:23): “So you will not be able to say, ‘I have made Avram wealthy’” — [implying that beforehand, he indeed was not wealthy]. And nowhere does it say he had acquired fame. [Since he never had these things, he need not fear losing them on account of traveling!] It seems the answer is: Rashi means that for one who has them, traveling inhibits these things. And one who lacks them surely will not acquire them on account of traveling. Thus Avraham needed these three specific blessings in order to @ITacquire@it them, being that they are contrary to the norm, for traveling inhibits them. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @BOHe promised him children, wealth and fame .<TIE>.<TIE>. @bo Rashi seems to be saying: since traveling inhibits having children, Hashem therefore promised him that traveling will not harm him. If he were not to travel he would have had children, so too he will have children, in spite of his traveling. But this contradicts what Rashi said before: “Here@IT @ityou will @ITnot@it merit having children.” Similarly, since traveling lessens fame, Hashem promised him that traveling will not harm him. If he were not to travel he would have fame, so too he will have fame in spite of traveling. But this contradicts what Rashi said before: “I will make your character known to the world,” implying that outside of Eretz Yisrael he had no fame at all. A further question: Why does Rashi first explain @hh<HEB>והיה ברכה@ee<ENG> and only then say, “An alternate explanation: @hh<HEB>ואעשך לגוי גדול@ee<TIE><ENG>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” which is contrary to the verse’s order? Moreover, why does Rashi first explain @hh<HEB>ואעשך לגוי גדול@ee<ENG> and only then explain @hh<HEB>מארצך וממולדתך@ee<ENG>, which is contrary to the verse’s order? The @ITRe’m@it answers that Rashi cited the Bereishis Rabbah’s teaching [of “Traveling causes three things<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”] at the end, to show that it disagrees with the previous explanation of “For your own benefit, for your own good.” But there is another, more intricate answer: When Rashi says, “Traveling causes three things<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” he is not explaining @hh<HEB>ואעשך לגוי גדול@ee<ENG> [differently than before]. Rather he is challenging what he said before, “Here you will not merit having children” — for in Bereishis Rabbah it says that “traveling causes three things<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” and this implies Avraham would indeed have children without traveling to Eretz Yisrael. And lest we claim that the text of the Midrash Rabbah is inaccurate, as children and fame are mentioned in the verse while wealth is not, Rashi then explains that wealth is also mentioned: @hh<HEB>ואברכך@ee<ENG> refers to wealth. And lest we still claim that the Midrash is inaccurate, as it attempts to interpret all the extra words in the verse, but how will it interpret @hh<HEB>והיה ברכה@ee<ENG>? To answer this, Rashi explains that @hh<HEB>והיה ברכה@ee<ENG> comes to teach that, “The blessings are entrusted to you.<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Perforce the Midrash is accurate, and therefore it presents a difficulty on Rashi’s first explanation. Rashi answers: “An alternate explanation is .<TIE>.<TIE>. the basis of the opening Shemoneh Esrei prayer<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Rashi is saying that the Midrash Rabbah itself has an additional explanation for @hh<HEB>ואעשך לגוי גדול@ee<ENG>. Consequently, when Rashi said, “Here you will not merit having children,” is in line with the Midrash Rabbah’s alternate explanation. (@ITauthor’s commentary@it) @BOThis is when we say: “God of Avraham.” @boThe verse implies this explanation, since only about a multitude is it said, “God of.” For instance, it says, “God of Israel” (33:20), “God of the Hebrews” (Shemos 3:18) and “the gods of the peoples” (Devarim 6:14). The Torah never says “God of” about an individual. Accordingly, Hashem told Avraham: “I will make you into a great nation” — you will be as a great nation, since they will say about you “God of Avraham.” And since “I will bless you” connotes additional blessing, it means that also Avraham’s son will be so blessed, that they will say “God of Yitzchok.” And since “I will make your name great” connotes further greatness, it means that also Avraham’s grandson will be so blessed, that they will say “God of Yaakov.” The reason this blessing was dependent on his traveling to Eretz Yisrael, and he could not receive this blessing outside of the Land [of Yisrael], is because it says in Kesubos 110b: “Anyone who lives outside the Land [of Yisrael] is considered as if he has no God.” Therefore, “God of Avraham” could not be said unless he traveled to Eretz Yisrael. Rashi offers this alternate explanation, [about the Shemoneh Esrei,] because according to the [first] explanation, the verse should say @hh<HEB>והיה מבורך@ee<ENG> [rather than @hh<HEB>והיה ברכה@ee<ENG>] — as the verse is speaking about the one who offers blessings. Thus Rashi gives the alternative explanation [in which the verse speaks about the blessing itself]. Then Rashi goes on to explain the whole verse accordingly. And Rashi’s explanation of @hh<HEB>והיה ברכה@ee<ENG> [is based on] the gematria of@hh<HEB>והיה @ee<ENG>, which is the same as that of @hh<HEB>י-ה-ו-ה@ee<ENG>. It hints that only with mention of Avraham do we conclude the [first] blessing [of the Shemoneh Esrei] and say: @hh<HEB>ברוך אתה ה' מגן @hbאברהם@ee<ENG>. (@ITMaharshal@it) @BOKeep distancing yourself from there@bo. Regarding “your father’s house,” where Avraham was living, @hh<HEB>לֶךְ@ee<ENG> could only mean “leave.” But regarding “your land,” which Avraham had already left, it could only mean “further distance yourself.” Thus Rashi was forced to explain @hh<HEB>לֶךְ@ee<ENG> both as “distancing” and as “leaving.” @BOIn order that it be precious in his eyes@bo. Rashi is answering the question: Why does the verse elaborate so much, by writing from where he left? It is obvious that he left his father’s house, as he was then living there. Scripture should simply have written, “Go to the land<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Rashi explains: The verse elaborated in order that Avraham’s own homeland will become more precious in his eyes. And this was to reward him for every word [Hashem spoke] and for every footstep [he took]. The more Hashem describes the land he is leaving, the more precious it becomes in his eyes, and the more will he be more pained upon leaving it. Thus his reward will be greater, since “The reward is according to the pain.” That is why there so many descriptions are written: “From your land, from your birthplace, and from your father’s house.” This fits well with what Rashi wrote next: “Similarly: ‘Your son .<TIE>.<TIE>. Yitzchok.’” Hashem elaborated about Yitzchok, using many descriptions, to make him precious in Avraham’s eyes and give Avraham great reward for every word. The many descriptions served to increase Avraham’s pain in sacrificing his son and parting with him. For the same reason, here Hashem did not tell Avraham where he was going, [so he would think:] “Perhaps it is worse than the place I am leaving,” and he will be more pained. And this will increase his reward. (@ITRe’m@it) The @ITMaharshal@it explains that Rashi is answering two questions: 1.<TIE>Why does the verse elaborate so much? It should say right away, “.<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>From your father’s house.” 2.<TIE>Why did Hashem not tell him immediately [where he was going]? Rashi answers: 1.<TIE>The purpose of the elaboration was to make his homeland more precious in his eyes. 2.<TIE>He did not tell him immediately [where he was going], to reward him for every word. Then Rashi explains that Hashem similarly elaborated in order to make Yitzchok precious to Avraham, and did not reveal the place in order to reward him. I agree with this explanation, except [for one point:] my teacher @ITMaharam Yafeh@it is right that when Rashi says, “In order that @ITit@it be precious in his eyes,” it refers to the land mentioned previously, [which is Eretz Yisrael]. For Rashi said right before, [regarding Avraham’s destination,] “He did not immediately reveal which land it was.” Whereas the land Avraham left was not mentioned at all. How could that be the land Rashi refers to? Similarly with, “Please take your son<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (22:2), about which Rashi says: “So that he value the mitzvah.” This refers to valuing the mitzvah of the @ITAkeidah,@it [not Yitzchok]. (@ITTzeidah L’Derech@it)<QC>
@p1[5]@p2<TIE>And Sarah would convert the women@p3. Rashi knows this because it is written @hh<HEB>אשר עשו בחרן@ee<ENG>, in plural — referring to both Avraham and Sarah. It seems that [Rashi knew they made converts because] a convert is regarded as a newborn. Thus it is considered as if they “made” them. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1[6]@p2<TIE>He entered it@p3. @hh<HEB>ויעבור@ee<ENG> usually means “he passed through” the land but did not dwell there. Thus Rashi needed to explain that here it is different, and means, “He entered it.” Rashi knows this because here it is written @hb<HEB>ב@hhארץ@ee<ENG>, not @hb<HEB>ה@hhארץ@ee<ENG>. Alternatively, because it is written: “Until the place of Shechem,” and Shechem is in Eretz Canaan. @BOTo pray for Yaakov’s sons@bo. Rashi is answering the question: Why does it not recount that he came to Sukkos, the city closest to Eretz Yisrael’s boundary — as we see in Parshas Vayishlach (33:17)? Thus Rashi explains that [he came to Shechem] to pray. Alternatively, Rashi is answering the question: Why does it say, “The @ITplace@it of Shechem,” and not, “The @ITcity@it of Shechem,” as it is written later (33:18), “Yaakov arrived safely at the city of Shechem”? Thus Rashi explains that he came to pray, and it says “place” because he who prays should set for himself a fixed @ITplace@it for his prayer. This is preferable to @ITRe’m’s@it explanation, that otherwise there is no reason to say, “Until the place of Shechem” [at all]. One might ask: If Avraham knew all this prophetically, why did he say later (15:2-3): “My Master, God, what will You give me since I continue to be childless .<TIE>.<TIE>. and the manager of my household is Eliezer of Damascus. Behold, You have not given me children .<TIE>.<TIE>. .”? We see he feared he would die without children! The answer is: Despite [his knowing about Yaakov’s sons], Avraham feared he would not have children until very old age, and Eliezer would take his wealth. (@ITR. Noson@it)<QC>
@BOHe showed him Mount Gerizim@bo. Rashi is answering the question: If Shechem is the same as the Plain of Moreh — and it is written, “Until the place of Shechem” — why does it also need to be called the Plain of Moreh? Rashi answers, “He showed him Mount Gerizim and Mount Eival.” And it is written [regarding the oath that was taken there], “The Plain of Moreh” (Devarim 11:30). @BOWhere Israel accepted@bo .<TIE>.<TIE>. [@hh<HEB>אלון מורה@ee<ENG> is so called] because @hh<HEB>אלון@ee<ENG> is from the root of @hh<HEB>אלה@ee<ENG> (oath), and @hh<HEB>מורה@ee<ENG> is from the root of @hh<HEB>הוראה@ee<ENG>, which is Torah. (@ITMaharshal@it) @BOHe gradually conquered. @boRashi is answering the question: “Then” is qualifying word, implying that in Avraham’s days it was so, but afterwards, the Canaanites were not in the Land. But how can this be? They were still there in Moshe’s days! Thus Rashi needed to explain that it means “then but not before.” For [in Avraham’s days,] the Canaanites began conquering the Land. @BOFor it fell to the share of Sheim@bo. This indeed contradicts what Rashi said in (Bamidbar 13:22) @hh<HEB>וחברון שבע שנים נבנתה לפני צען מצרים@ee<ENG>. [There Rashi said that Cham built Hebron, implying that all of Eretz Yisrael belonged to Cham — not Sheim — from the start.] Yet we can answer that these Aggados disagree with each other. But we cannot answer that all of Eretz Yisrael fell to Cham, except for Jerusalem and its vicinity which fell to Sheim. For Rashi says here, “He [the Canaanite] gradually conquered @ITEretz Yisrael@it from the descendants of Sheim,” implying that all of Eretz Yisrael was Sheim’s. (@ITRe’m@it) However, the answer that only Jerusalem and its vicinity was Sheim’s seems better. For “The Canaanite gradually conquered Eretz Yisrael” could refer to the small part of Eretz Yisrael that Cham’s son Canaan did not already have. This is better than saying that the Midrashim disagree with each other. @ITMahara Ashkenazi@it writes: All Eretz Yisrael surely belonged to Sheim, as Rashi implies here. And what Rashi wrote on Bamidbar 13:22 should be understood as follows: If one man built two cities, it would make sense to identify which was built first. Thus if Cham was the builder, the Torah could very well be identifying which he built first, [by saying @hh<HEB>וחברון שבע שנים נבנתה לפני צען מצרים@ee<ENG>]. But it cannot be that Cham built both Hebron and Zoan, due to Rashi’s question there: “Could Cham have built Hebron for Canaan his youngest son, before building Zoan for Mitzrayim his eldest son?!” Thus we see that Sheim built Hebron, while Cham built Zoan. Consequently, the Torah cannot be saying that Hebron preceded Zoan by seven years, as different people built them, and there is no reason to identify their respective order. It follows that there is no contradiction at all [between what Rashi said in Bamidbar and what he said here]. And the verse in Bamidbar means, [as Rashi concludes there,] “Hebron was built up with everything good, seven times more than Zoan.” @BOAs it is said: “Malki Zedek King of Shaleim.” @boMalki Zedek is Sheim the son of Noach, as Rashi explains on 14:18. And King of Shaleim means King of Yerushalayim. [Thus, the Land originally was Sheim’s]. @p1[7]@p2<TIE>For the tidings of children@p3 .<TIE>.<TIE>. Rashi is answering the question: Why did Avraham build an altar now? If he built it on account of the Divine revelation, as the verse seems to be saying, then he should have built an altar in Charan as well — for Hashem appeared to him also there and said, “Go from your land.” Although it is not written there, “God appeared,” it was a Divine revelation nonetheless. Therefore Rashi explains, “For the tidings of children and for the tidings of Eretz Yisrael.” For it says, “To your @ITdescendants@it I will give this @ITland@it,” and this contains both tidings. Furthermore, Rashi knows this because it is written, “To Adonoy @ITWho had appeared to him@it.” Why is it not written just, “To Adonoy”? Because from “Who had appeared to him,” we learn that he built the altar on account of the vision he had now: the tidings of children and Eretz Yisrael. @p1[8]@p2<TIE>This refers to his tent@p3. Rashi is answering the question: Why does it say @hh<HEB>ויעתק@ee<ENG>, a term that is used in conjunction with a living being? The proper term is @hh<HEB>יציאה@ee<ENG>, as in v. 5: @hh<HEB>ויקח אברם .<TIE>.<TIE>. ויצאו ללכת ארצה כנען@ee<ENG>. Or the term @hh<HEB>נסיעה@ee<ENG>, as in v. 9: @hh<HEB>ויסע אברם.<TIE>.<TIE>.@ee<ENG>. Thus Rashi explains that @hh<HEB>ויעתק@ee<ENG> is referring to his tent, i.e., he moved his tent, [not himself]. @BOMeans east of Beis-Eil@bo. Rashi is saying that @hh<HEB>מקדם@ee<ENG> is connected to @hh<HEB>ההרה@ee<ENG>, and is explaining where the mountain was. It does not refer back to, “From there he moved,” stating from where he traveled. Rashi proof is because it is written: “Beis-Eil was to the west and Ai was to the east.” If @hh<HEB>מקדם@ee<ENG> refers to where he traveled from, why was Beis-Eil described as being to the west? On the contrary: before he traveled, Beis-Eil was to his west. But now that he traveled from the east [of Beis-Eil] in a different direction [of Beis-Eil], it would no longer be to his west. Thus, we must say that @hh<HEB>מקדם@ee<ENG> is connected to @hh<HEB>ההרה@ee<ENG>. And this is why Rashi then says, “Whereby Beis-Eil is located to his west.” I.e., it is now understandable for Beis-Eil to be described as being to the west. We need not ask: If it means “east of Beis-Eil” why is it not written @hb<HEB>ב@hhקדם@ee<ENG>. For @hb<HEB>מ@hhקדם@ee<ENG>, too, conveys that the mountain was east of Beis-Eil. The @hh<HEB>מ@ee<ENG> of @hb<HEB>מ@hhקדם@ee<ENG> is like the @hh<HEB>מ@ee<ENG> in, “Adonoy Elohim planted a garden in Eden, to the east (@hh<HEB>בעדן @hbמ@hhקדם@ee<ENG>)” (2:8). And there it means, “East of Eden.” @BOHe first pitched his wife’s tent@bo. You might ask: How does Rashi know? Perhaps it was the reverse! The answer is: Since it says in Yevamos 63b, “A man is obligated to honor his wife more than himself,” Avraham surely pitched hers first. @BOHe prophetically saw that his descendents were destined@bo. Rashi is answering the question: Why did Avraham build another altar? He already built one for the tidings of children and Eretz Yisrael. It seems that Hashem showed him specially this trouble, because it was like putting a qualification on the gift of Eretz Yisrael to his descendants (v. 7). If his descendants will sin as Achan did, they will fall into the hands of the Canaanites. (@ITKitzur Mizrachi@it) @p1[9]@p2<TIE>But, all his travels were southward, aimed at going.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: @hh<HEB>הלוך ונסוע@ee<ENG> implies that he traveled continuously. If so, is it written before, “From there he moved .<TIE>.<TIE>. his tent” — implying that he encamped in the meantime? [Rashi answers: “He would stay here a month or so, and then travel.”] And Rashi is answering another question: Why is it written, “Traveling steadily southward,” implying that he was traveling toward the world’s south, which is outside of Eretz Yisrael? This cannot be, for he was traveling from Charan to Eretz Yisrael. Therefore Rashi explains, “All his travels were southward, going to the south of Eretz Yisrael.” His travels were to Eretz Yisrael’s south. @p1[11]@p2<TIE>He became aware of her due to an event@p3. They crossed a river and she had to lift her clothes, so he saw she was beautiful. The Midrash says he recognized her great beauty when he saw her reflection in the water as they crossed. @BOAnother explanation: It is usual@bo .<TIE>.<TIE>. [Despite Rashi’s first explanation,] the verse is still selfcontradictory: @hh<HEB>הנה נא@ee<ENG> is present tense, while @hh<HEB>ידעתי@ee<ENG> is past tense. Therefore he offers another explanation. (@ITMaharshal@it) @BOThe simple explanation .<TIE>.<TIE>. I now realize the time has come to be concerned@bo. In this explanation, the verse must be divided. [The first part is:] “Behold I now realize the time has come .<TIE>.<TIE>. .” And the [second] part starts with @hh<HEB>ידעתי@ee<ENG>: “I have known this for a long time.” Rashi then proves that a verse may be so divided (19:2): “See now my lords, please turn .<TIE>.<TIE>. ’” [“See now” means:] “Behold, the time has come that you must be careful in regard to these cruel people.” [And “Please turn” means: “Turn off the main road to my home.” See Rashi there.] Some ask: It says in Kiddushin 41a that it is forbidden to marry a woman without seeing her first. [Why then did Avraham not know she was beautiful?] It seems the answer is: Avraham surely saw her before they married and he knew she was beautiful. But then she was very young, when it is natural to be beautiful. But now she was 65, and beauty usually changes. Thus, Avraham did not know until now [that she still was beautiful]. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @BOAmong black people@bo. [You might ask:] The people of Avimelech were not black. Why did Avraham say there (20:2), “She is my sister”? Avraham himself already answered this by saying (20:11), “There is no fear of Elohim in this place, and they will kill me to take my wife.” Rashi explains (@ITad loc@it) that Avraham knew this since he was asked about his wife as soon as he arrived, rather than being asked about food and lodging. This is preferable to the @ITRe’m’s@it answer that word had already spread that she was his sister, [thus they needed to continue saying so]. @p1[13]@p2<TIE>So that they give me gifts. @p3Rashi is answering the question: Why does it say @hh<HEB>ייטב@ee<ENG>? Avoidance of death is called @hh<HEB>הצלה@ee<ENG>, not @hh<HEB>הטבה@ee<ENG>. Thus Rashi explains, “So that they give me gifts.” You might ask: This implies that Avraham wanted gifts. Why did he later reject gifts from the king of Sedom? There he said (14:23), “Neither a thread nor a shoelace! I will not take anything of yours,” although the wealth was rightfully due to him, since he took it from the four kings. If so, he surely would not want outright gifts, for it is written (Mishlei 15:27): “He who hates gifts will live.” An answer is: Avraham wanted only a small gift, for it says in Berachos 10b, “One who wishes to benefit from others may do so, as did the Prophet Elisha.” This means one may take food, drink and lodging. And the proof [that Avraham objected only to substantial gifts] is that it is written (14:21): “The king of Sedom said, ‘Take take the @ITpossessions@it for yourself,’” to which Avraham answered, “I have lifted my hand to Adonoy .<TIE>.<TIE>. Neither a thread nor a shoelace! .<TIE>.<TIE>.so you will not be able to say, ‘I have made Avram @ITwealthy@it.’” A further answer is: Women desire money. So in order to appease her, he told her: “Please say .<TIE>.<TIE>. my sister, so that it will go well with me.” But Avraham never intended to take gifts from Pharaoh. A further answer is: Avraham had not yet acquired wealth, so he took gifts. [We see he was poor when he went down to Egypt] because the verse later says (13:3), “He continued on his travels,” on which Rashi says: “On his return trip he paid the debts he incurred.” But when speaking to the king of Sedom he had acquired wealth, thus he refused even what was rightfully due to him, because of “He who hates gifts will live.” Some ask: Why would Avraham want to cause the Egyptians to sin and take a married woman, by telling them Sarah was his sister? The answer is: He told them she was his sister, who was married and whose husband was overseas. This also explains why he said, “And my life will be spared @ITbecause of you.@it” Avraham said to Sarah, “I will tell them that you are my sister, and that you are married, but your husband left you. I am searching for him — perhaps I will find him and he will give you a @ITget@it, or perhaps he has died, and then you can remarry. Thus they will spare my life, [since I am helping] to avoid the sin of taking you as a married woman.” This also explains why Sarah agreed: since he told them that she might be married, they surely will not take her. (see @ITChizkuni@it) @p1[14]@p2<TIE>It should have said, “When @BIthey@bi came<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @boQuestion: Why did Rashi not make this comment before, on (v. 10) “Avram went down to Egypt,” or on (v. 11) “As he came near and was about to enter”? There as well it should have been written, “@ITThey@it went down,” and, “@ITThey@it came near.” [Rashi’s lack of comment there] indicates that Sarah and the others were clearly included when Avraham was mentioned, as he was the central figure of the home. If so, the same should be true here. The answer is: The earlier verses raised no question because Avraham indeed was the central figure, and everything was dependent upon him. But here, Sarah was the central figure: Avraham had requested @ITher@it to say she was his sister. Thus it should say, “When @ITthey@it came,” at least equating Sarah to Avraham. The @ITMahara’i@it answers: Only here can we object that “it should have said, ‘When @ITthey@it came.’” For here the subject of the verse is Sarah, not Avraham — as it is written, “The Egyptians beheld the woman.” But the earlier verse spoke of Avraham. Furthermore, Avraham was more important.<QC>
@p1[15]@p2<TIE>They praised her among themselves saying@p3 .<TIE>.<TIE>. Otherwise it should have written @hh<HEB>לפני פרעה@ee<ENG> or @hh<HEB>לפרעה@ee<ENG>, [rather than @hh<HEB>אל פרעה@ee<ENG>]. @p1[17]@p2<TIE>With a kind of skin disease@p3 .<TIE>.<TIE>. There are twenty-four types of rashes, none of which is more harmful for marital relations than this kind (@hh<HEB>ראתן@ee<ENG>). And [it must be that] Pharaoh was afflicted with it, for otherwise how did Pharaoh know she was his wife, so that he immediately called for Avraham [and said, “She is your wife”]?<QC>
@BOAccording to her words@bo. Rashi is answering the question: Why is it not written @hh<HEB>אודות שרי@ee<ENG> [instead of @hh<HEB>דבר שרי@ee<ENG>]? @p1[20]@p2<TIE>Concerning him@p3. Rashi is answering the question: If [@hh<HEB>ויצו עליו@ee<ENG> means] Pharaoh commanded Avraham some-thing, why does the verse not say what it was? Thus Rashi says it means, “Concerning him, to escort and protect him.” But a question remains: How did Rashi know that this is what Pharaoh had commanded? Perhaps he commanded that they let Avraham depart in peace, unhindered, not that he be protected. To answer this, Rashi explains that @hh<HEB>וישלחו@ee<ENG> means as the Targum says: “They escorted him.” And this implies, “To protect him.” [Note: The text of Rashi’s commentary on 13:1-2 was apparently in a different order than it appears today.] But a question still remains: How did the Targum know this? To answer this, Rashi explains that @hh<HEB>כבד מאוד@ee<ENG> (v. 2) means, “He was laden with baggage.” Since the Torah relates Avraham’s honor at length, his departure from Egypt must also have been in an honorable fashion. And that is why Rashi explained @hh<HEB>כבד מאוד@ee<ENG> before @hh<HEB>ויעל אברם@ee<ENG>, contrary to the order of the verses. @p1[1]@p2<TIE>To arrive at the south of Eretz Yisrael.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Avraham was [already] in the south, for Egypt is south of Eretz Yisrael and in the south of the world. Accordingly, why is it not written, “Avraham went up north”? Thus Rashi explains, “To arrive at the south of Eretz Yisrael.” @p1[3]@p2<TIE>This teaches good manners that a person not change .<TIE>.<TIE>. @p3 This explanation raises a question: Why does it not say @hb<HEB>ב@hhמסעיו@ee<ENG>? Thus Rashi offered another explanation: “On his return trip he paid the debts he incurred.” But according to that explanation it should say @hb<HEB>ו@hhיחזור למסעיו@ee<ENG>. Why does it say @hh<HEB>וילך@ee<ENG>? Thus we need the first explanation as well. (@ITMaharshal@it) @BOEgypt is south of .<TIE>.<TIE>. @boRashi is answering the question: Above it says [that he was traveling @ITto@it] @hh<HEB>הנגבה@ee<ENG>. If so, why is it not written here @hh<HEB>וילך למסעיו הנגבה@ee<ENG>? Thus Rashi explains that Egypt is in the south. Accordingly, @hh<HEB>הנגבה@ee<ENG> [in our verse] refers to Egypt. @p1[4]@p2<TIE>And where “Avram called<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p3Rashi is answering the question: Since Avraham already made an altar there and called in the Name of Hashem, why does it tell us here [again], “And there Avram called<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”? Thus Rashi explains that the verse is informing us where he went: to the place from where he had already called in the Name of Hashem. @p1[5]@p2<TIE>What brought this about? @p3Rashi is answering the question: It is already written (v. 1), “Avram went .<TIE>.<TIE>. @ITtogether with Lot@it into the south,” [so why is it repeated?] @p1[6]@p2<TIE>The text, therefore, reads @hb<HEB>ולא נשא@BO<ENG>, in the masculine form. @boRashi is answering the question: Since @hh<HEB>הארץ@ee<ENG> [which is the subject] is feminine, why does it say @hh<HEB>נשא@ee<ENG> in the masculine? And there is a further question: Why was the land unable to bear [the weight of] people? Thus Rashi explains, “It could not provide enough @hh<HEB>מרעה@ee<ENG> (pasture).” In other words, @hh<HEB>נשא@ee<ENG> refers to the [implied word] @hh<HEB>מרעה@ee<ENG>, which is masculine. @p1[7]@p2<TIE>Because Lot’s shepherds were@p3 .<TIE>.<TIE>.  Rashi is answering the questions: Why did they quarrel, and why does it say here, “The Canaanites .<TIE>.<TIE>. were then living in the land”? Rashi explains: [They quarreled] “because Lot’s shepherds were wicked and grazed their animals in others’ fields .<TIE>.<TIE>. .” And the verse says, “The Canaanites .<TIE>.<TIE>. were then living in the land” because this was Hashem’s response [to their claim that it is not robbery]. And we need not ask why Avraham’s shepherds did not respond that Avraham will still beget an heir, for the response they gave was a better one, in that even Lot’s shepherds, who did not know that Avraham would still beget an heir, [had to admit that] “the Canaanites .<TIE>.<TIE>. were then living in the land.”<QC>
@BOSo that Avram did not yet possess it. @boOtherwise, Avram would give them permission to graze wherever they wish. (@ITGur Aryeh@it) @p1[8]@p2<TIE>Relatives@p3. Rashi is answering the question: They were not brothers, only relatives. [Why does it call them @hh<HEB>אחים@ee<ENG>?] And according to the Midrashic explanation, that they were called brothers because they looked similar, @hh<HEB>אחים@ee<ENG> means @hb<HEB>כ@hhאחים@ee<ENG> (@ITlike@it brothers). @p1[9]@p2<TIE>I will not go far from you .<TIE>.<TIE>. @p3Rashi is answering the question: Avraham just said, “We are kinsmen.” Why does he now say, “If you go to the left, I will go to the right” — implying he wants to distance himself due to the hatred between them? Where did the hatred come from? There was no quarrel between them, [only between the shepherds]. Thus Rashi explains, “I will not go far from you<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” [Alternatively,] Rashi explained this because the words seem superfluous, as it could have just said, “Please separate from me.” Therefore Rashi explains: “I will not go far<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” And if you ask why Avraham needed to promise this to Lot, Rashi answers: [To tell him that] “I will stand by you as a shield.” (@ITR. Yaakov Kenizal@it) Rashi is answering the question: If Lot goes to the left, Avraham will obviously be on his right! [Why did the verse need to state this?] Thus Rashi explains: Avraham will actually stay near him by his right. He will not distance himself. (@ITR. Shmuel El Mashonino@it) @p1[10]@p2<TIE>A land of water streams@p3. Rashi is answering the question: @hh<HEB>משקה@ee<ENG> is a causative verb [meaning “to cause to be watered”]. In what way is the causative form appropriate here? Furthermore, the verse is speaking about streams, not about people watering fields. Thus Rashi explains: “A land of water streams,” and they are called @hh<HEB>משקה@ee<ENG> because people use them to water the fields. @BOThat plain was<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo Rashi is explaining that “Before Adonoy destroyed Sedom and Amorah is read with, “It was like Adonoy’s garden.<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” It is not read with the preceding phrase, “It was abundantly watered.” [Rashi knows this] because otherwise, what would it be telling us? The verse had already written, “Lot raised his eyes and saw<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” and this was before Hashem destroyed Sedom. Perforce, it is read with, “It was like Adonoy’s garden<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (@ITRe’m@it)<QC>
@BOFor trees@bo. Rashi inferred this from (2:9): “Adonoy Elohim made grow out of the soil every @ITtree@it .<TIE>.<TIE>. in the middle of the @ITgarden,@it” which shows that “garden” refers to trees. And Rashi explained like the land of Egypt “for @hh<HEB>זרעים@ee<ENG>” because it is written in Devarim 11:10: “For the land to which you are coming .<TIE>.<TIE>. is not like the land of @ITEgypt@it .<TIE>.<TIE>. where you sowed your @hh<HEB>זרעים@ee<ENG>.” This shows that Egypt is a land of @hh<HEB>זרעים@ee<ENG>. (@ITRe’m@it) [Without Rashi’s explanation that “garden” refers to trees, while “Egypt” refers to @hh<HEB>זרעים@ee<ENG>,] the verse’s comparisons [to two different places] seem both to relate to the same point. If so, only the better of the two need be mentioned — and if Scripture wishes to mention both, the better one should be mentioned last. It should say, “It was like the land of Egypt, [and was even] like God’s garden.” [Thus the verse’s is difficult to understand,] for if it was as good as Hashem’s garden, surely it was as good as the land of Egypt! Therefore, Rashi explains that the comparisons relate to two different points. (@ITR. Yaakov Kenizal@it) @p1[11]@p2<TIE>He departed from Avram@p3. Rashi is answering the question: We see that Beis-Eil, [where they were located,] is in the north. For it is written (12:9): “Avram journeyed [from Beis-Eil], traveling steadily southward.” If so, why does it not say here, “Lot journeyed from the north”? Thus Rashi explains that he “departed from Avram .<TIE>.<TIE>. traveling from east to west.” The @ITRe’m@it writes: This is puzzling, as the boundaries of the Land indicate that the Jordan Plain is to the east of Eretz Yisrael, while Beis-Eil is within. Thus, traveling from Beis-Eil, where Avraham lived, to the Jordan Plain entails going to the east! @ITRe’m @itleft this unresolved. It seems to me that the answer is: The Jordan Plain was very large and extended within Eretz Yisrael. It reached close to Jerusalem, which is distant from Beis-Eil and within Eretz Yisrael. [This is possible] because the Jordan Plain was close to Sedom, which is not so far from Jerusalem. @BOFrom the One Who precedes the world@bo. Otherwise it should say, “Lot journeyed from Avram,” as they were dwelling together, and Lot departed from him. (@ITKitzur@it @ITMizrachi@it) @p1[12]@p2<TIE>He pitched tents for his shepherds@p3. Rashi is answering the question: Why does it say, “Setting up his tents as far as Sedom,” [if Lot lived in the Plain]? Thus Rashi explains: “He pitched tents for his shepherds.” I.e., he had many tents and pitched them from the Plain until Sedom. @p1[13]@p2<TIE>Our Sages learned from here, “The names of the wicked shall rot.”@p3 There was no need at all for Scripture to write, “The people of Sedom were wicked and sinful.” Scripture wrote this because the people of Sedom needed to be mentioned in the previous verse: “Setting up his tents as far as Sedom.” That is why Scripture writes here that they were “wicked and sinful.” From this Shlomo HaMelech learned, “The names of the wicked shall rot.” I.e., when they are mentioned they should be disparaged. @HB<HEB>רעים@BO<ENG> with their persons. @HB<HEB>וחטאים@BO<ENG> with their wealth.@bo Rashi’s explanation is the opposite of Onkelos, who translated: “@hh<HEB>רעים@ee<ENG> with their money. @hh<HEB>וחטאים@ee<ENG> with their persons.” You might ask: How did Rashi know [that it means as he explained]? The answer is: Yosef said (39:9), “How can I do such a great @hh<HEB>רעה@ee<ENG>,” speaking of sinning with his person. Here too, @hh<HEB>רעים@ee<ENG> means sinning with their persons. And it is written in Devarim 24:15 about a hired worker: “You shall give him his wage on his day .<TIE>.<TIE>. lest there be @hh<HEB>חטא@ee<ENG> upon you.” And this involves money. @p1[14]@p2<TIE>At that time he was righteous. @p3This can be seen also from Rashi’s comment on v. 10: “It was because they were permeated with immorality that Lot chose their locality.” [We may assume that] Lot became this way due to having been in Egypt, where they also were permeated with immorality, and he learned from them. Furthermore, Rashi explained on v. 11, “Lot removed himself from the One Who precedes the world” — implying that previously he was righteous.<QC>
@p1[18]@p2<TIE>The name of a person. @p3I.e., not the name of a place. For it is written (v. 24): “The men who went with me Aneir, Eshkol and Mamrei.” @p1[1]@p2<TIE>Who told Avraham, “Jump<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Was not Nimrod [not Amraphel] the king of Shinar?<QC>
@p1[2]@p2<TIE>He set his wings .<TIE>.<TIE>. @p3 Meaning, he made himself wings to fly. @BOThe name of the city@bo. Rashi knows this because it says @hh<HEB>בלע היא צוער@ee<ENG>. If Bela was the name of a person, it would not say @hh<HEB>היא צוער@ee<ENG>. We need not ask how Rashi knew these kings’ names were mentioned to tell us their wickedness, and thus interprets Shinav to mean, “He hated his Father in Heaven,” etc. For the answer is: Since the king of Zoar’s name is omitted, it must be that the others’ names were mentioned to convey their wickedness. It is likely that the king of Zoar was not wicked, thus his name did not show his wickedness. For it says concerning Lot (19:20): “Let me escape there [to Zoar],” and Rashi explains there [that Zoar’s sins were few]. @p1[3]@p2<TIE>Many fields were in it. @p3Since it is written @hb<HEB>ה@hhשדים@ee<ENG>, with a “specifying @hh<HEB>ה@ee<ENG>,” but it does not specify where the “Siddim Valley” is located, Rashi explained that “it was so called because of the many fields (@hh<HEB>שדות@ee<ENG>) .<TIE>.<TIE>. .” (@ITR. Shmuel El Mashonino@it) But it seems to me that Rashi is saying that the proper name of the valley derives from its descriptive name. I.e., the Siddim Valley is its name, and it has no other proper name. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @BOAfterward, the sea flowed into it@bo. [Rashi says this] because it cannot be a valley and a sea simultaneously. @BOThat the surrounding stones cracked<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. @bo[Rashi offers this Midrashic explanation] because @hh<HEB>הוא ים@ee<ENG> connotes that it became a sea on its own — not that the sea flowed into it. Otherwise, it should say @hh<HEB>בו ים@ee<ENG>. @p1[5]@p2<TIE>Of their rebellion .<TIE>.<TIE>. @p3 By saying, “Of their rebellion,” Rashi is telling us that it does @ITnot @itmean they served Kedorlaomer for twelve years, and the next year they rebelled, and the next year Kedorlaomer came. For then it should have said @hb<HEB>וב@hhשלש עשרה שנה@ee<ENG>, as it says afterwards, @hb<HEB>וב@hhארבע עשרה שנה@ee<ENG>. Rather, Rashi is saying that after serving for twelve years, they rebelled for a thirteen year period. And the very next year, i.e., in the fourteenth year, “Kedorlaomer came.” @BOThese are the Zamzumim. @boRashi knows this because it is written here Rephaim and Aimim, and mentions the Zuzim with them — while in Devarim 2:11, it mentions Rephaim, Aimim and Zamzumim. Thus, Zuzim must be Zamzumim. @p1[6]@p2<TIE>But that the plain of Paran was called @p3@hh<HEB>איל@ee<ENG>. Rashi is answering the question: Onkelos translated @hh<HEB>אלוני@ee<ENG> (v. 13) as “the plain” of Mamrei. If @hh<HEB>אלוני@ee<ENG> means “plain,” how can @hh<HEB>איל@ee<ENG> also mean “plain”? Thus Rashi explains, “I maintain that this does not mean<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”<QC>
@p1[9]@p2<TIE>Yet, the fewer ones were victorious@p3. Rashi is answering the question: Why does it need to state, “Four kings”? We see that they were four! Thus he explains [that it comes to teach]: “Yet .<TIE>.<TIE>. Avraham did not refrain<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1[10]@p2 There were many pits .<TIE>.<TIE>. @p3Rashi is answering the question: Why does it say @hh<HEB>בארות@ee<ENG> twice? Another question: If the pits had mortar, why is it written, “They @ITfell@it there”? It should say, “They @ITsank@it there,” as is in Yirmeyahu 38:6: “And Yirmeyahu sank into the cement.” Another question: Since the pits had mortar, why did they not die when they sank into the mortar, which is cement? Thus Rashi explains that there were many pits, and they did not actually contain mortar but provided earth for making mortar. @BOThe Midrashic explanation is .<TIE>.<TIE>. the King of Sedom escaped .<TIE>.<TIE>. @boRashi is answering the question: Why are the pits called @hh<HEB>בארות@ee<ENG> (lit. “wells”), if they would remove all the [earth for the] mortar from the pits? @hh<HEB>בארות@ee<ENG> implies they were always full of cement! Thus Rashi brings the Midrashic explanation. (@ITMaharshal@it)<QC>
@p1[13]@p2<TIE>This refers to Og who escaped from the war@p3. But not that he survived the Flood. For it is written (7:23), “Only Noach and those with him in the ark survived.” @BOAs is written, “The @HB<HEB>נפילים@BO<ENG> were upon the land.” @boRashi is saying that @hh<HEB>רפאים@ee<ENG> means giants, and the @hh<HEB>נפילים@ee<ENG> also were giants who lived in the generation of the Flood. Og was a remnant of the giants who lived in the generation of the Flood. [According to this explanation,] @hh<HEB>אך נח@ee<ENG> [previously translated as “only Noach”] means as Rashi explained on 7:23: “He was coughing and spitting blood<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” And @hh<HEB>ואשר אתו@ee<ENG> (those with him) means: “ .<TIE>.<TIE>. from the toil and burden of the animals that were @ITwith him@it in the ark.” @BOThat Avram be killed so he might marry Sarah@bo. Rashi is explaining according to the latter Midrash why Og came to tell Avraham about Lot. According to the first explanation, that Og escaped the war, it is understandable. He told Avram in order to take revenge on Amraphel and the others who had killed his family. But according to the latter Midrash, why did he tell him? Perforce, “It was his intention that Avram be killed<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1[14]@p2<TIE>As the Targum translates: “And he armed.” @p3[You might ask:] Rashi explained on Shemos 15:9 that [@hh<HEB>אריק חרבי@ee<ENG> means, “I will draw My sword,” and he writes:] “Do not make a forced interpretation that @hh<HEB>אריק חרבי@ee<ENG> means the same as in @hh<HEB>וירק את חניכיו@ee<ENG>, and conveys, “I will arm myself with a sword.” [So why does Rashi here say that it means “to arm”? The answer is:] Rashi is saying here that the term @ITcould@it be interpreted everywhere as “to arm” — whereas in our verse this is its only possible interpretation, since it refers to “his trained servants,” [not to a weapon]. Thus Rashi explains @hh<HEB>אריק@ee<ENG> in the other verses in a forced way, so we will not immediately object to his interpretation here, citing the other verses. But in truth, it means “to draw” everywhere except for here. Thus Rashi said there: “And do not make a forced interpretation.” (See @ITRe’m@it for a different explanation) @BOAnd it is the @BIgematria@bi equivalent of his name@bo. @ITR. Noson@it asks: Since a verse never leaves its plain meaning [altogether], and it says that there were 318 [men involved, how could Rashi say it was only Eliezer]? He answers, citing Rabbeinu Bechayeh, that the men of Avraham’s household indeed numbered 318. But after Avraham prepared them for war he decreased their number by ordering all the sinners to go back home, in accordance with Torah law (Devarim 20:8): [“And the officers shall continue to speak to the people and say,] ‘What man is there who is fearful .<TIE>.<TIE>. ’” Thus [in the end], only he and Eliezer remained. But the @ITGur Aryeh @itwrites that all 318 men surely went with him, to frighten the kings so they would not stand strong against him. Avraham alone could have defeated them, as nothing can stop Hashem. But he took them so as to use natural strength and thereby conceal the miracle, as it says (Yehoshua 8:2): “Set yourself an ambush.<TIE>.<TIE>.” And he took the [number of people] that is to the @ITgematria@it of Eliezer, to hint that all [the men came] on account of Eliezer, [so that Avraham would not be only with his faithful servant Eliezer].<QC>
@BOThere his strength ebbed. For he saw<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. @bo[Rashi offers this Midrashic explanation] because it is written later, “He pursued them until Chovah,” which is Dan. If so, why does it need to say here, “And he pursued until Dan”? (@ITKitzur Mizrachi@it) @p1[15]@p2<TIE>According to its plain meaning the verse should be inverted<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. @p3 Without inverting, the division refers to the night, and the following “he and his servants” does not convey anything. (@ITKitzur Mizrachi@it) @BOThe Midrashic explanation is<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. @bo[Accordingly,] “He and his servants<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” is read with what follows below “ .<TIE>.<TIE>. attacked them and pursued them.”<QC>
@p1[18]@p2<TIE>The Midrash Aggadah explains that he is Sheim@p3. For the abbreviation of @hb<HEB>מ@hhלך @hbש@hhלם@ee<ENG>, when reversed, spells @hh<HEB>שם@ee<ENG>. @BOHe bore him no resentment for his having killed his descendants@bo. For it says, “After his return from defeating Kedorlaomer” — and Kedorlaomer was the king of Ailam, one of Sheim’s descendants. Assumedly, his people also were from Sheim. Rashi explains, “This is done for those who are battle-weary,” because if he meant to feed them as [honored] guests, why did he not bring out cattle and sheep to slaughter for them? But @ITRe’m@it explains that if [he meant to feed them as guests], why does it say he brought out bread @ITand wine@it<HS><HS>? Scripture always mentions bread alone, such as (18:5): “I will get bread,” and (Shemos 18:12): “Aharon and all the elders of Yisrael came to eat bread.” Here, why does it mention wine too? Perforce, because they were battle-weary. @p1[20]@p2<TIE>He gave him. Avram. @p3Rashi is answering the question: Who gave to whom? Thus Rashi explains that Avram gave to Sheim. And why did Avram do so? Because Sheim was a Kohein.<QC>
@p1[22]@p2<TIE>This is an expression of an oath.@p3 There is no actual mention of an oath here — unlike with, “For I raise up My hand (@hh<HEB>אשא ידי@ee<ENG>) to heaven<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (Devarim 32:40), where it is written right afterwards, “ .<TIE>.<TIE>. and I say, ‘As I live forever.’” Nevertheless, Scripture was brief here and relied on our understanding. (@ITRe’m@it) Furthermore, we can say that @hh<HEB>אשא ידי@ee<ENG> [on its own] is considered an expression of mentioning an oath. And it is actually another way of saying @hh<HEB>הרימותי ידי@ee<ENG>. Therefore, @hh<HEB>הרימותי ידי@ee<ENG> is also an expression of an oath, although it is not expressly stated. @p1[23]@p2<TIE>And if you offer to compensate me.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi knew this because it says, “@ITAnd@it I will not take, implying that “Neither a thread nor a shoelace” is a separate point which means: I will not retain the spoils. [Then comes a new point:] “@ITAnd@it I will not take” from your treasure house. Alternatively, Rashi is answering the question: [The spoils] were already in Avraham’s hands. Why did he say, “I will not @ITtake@it”? Perforce it means, “I will not take compensation from your treasure house.” @p1[24]@p2<TIE>My servants who went with me.@p3 The verse should be divided into three parts: (1)<TIE>“I am excluding myself, only what the @ITlads@it have eaten” — referring to Avraham’s servants who accompanied him, for it is written before in v. 15: “He and his servants.” The phrase “who went with me” is Rashi’s own words [explaining who the “lads” are. It is not a quote from the verse]. (2)<TIE>“And the portion of the @ITmen@it who went with me” — referring to his trained servants (@hh<HEB>חניכיו@ee<ENG>) mentioned in v. 14 above. (3) “Aneir, Eshkol and Mamrei” — about them it says, “They may take their portion.” The fact that “portion” is mentioned again shows that “Aneir, Eshkol and Mamrei” must be different from “The men who went with me,” regarding whom it already is written, “And the portion of<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Therefore, “They may take their portion” refers only to “Aneir, Eshkol and Mamrei” [Thus there are three parts]. @BOAneir and his friends stayed with the supplies to guard it .<TIE>.<TIE>. @boRashi knows this because it is written in v. 13, “He [Avram] was living in the Plains of Mamrei the brother of Eshkol and Aneir.” And then it is written (v. 14), “When Avram heard .<TIE>.<TIE>. he pursued them<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” but it does not say Aneir and his friends [joined the pursuit]. Perforce, they remained behind to guard the supplies.<QC>
@p1[5]@p2<TIE>But @p3@BO@ITAvraham@bo@it@BO @bo@BO@ITwill@bo@it@BO have a son@bo. Although he had Yishmael while he was still called Avram, it says in Kiddushin 68b: “Your son from a nonJewess is not called your son.” Therefore, Yishmael could not be his heir. @BOThis explains the use of the term @bo@hh<HEB>הבטה@ee@BO<ENG>: from above to below@bo. You might ask: If so, why does it say (Bamidbar 21:9), “He would look (@hh<HEB>והביט@ee<ENG>) upon the copper snake and live,” [although he was lower than the snake]? The answer is: It means the @ITcopper snake@it would “look” upon him. And why is it written (Tehillim 34:6), “They looked (@hh<HEB>הביטו@ee<ENG>) to Him and became radiant,” which is from below to above? The answer is: Hashem is found everywhere. (@ITsource unknown@it) But @ITRe’m@it explains: Rashi is saying that the @hh<HEB>הבטה@ee<ENG> mentioned @IThere@it is from above to below, [but not everywhere else].<QC>
@p1[6]@p2<TIE>He did not ask of Him a sign concerning this .<TIE>.<TIE>. @p3 Rashi is answering the question: Would we think that Avraham might not believe in Hashem and in his own prophecy? Avraham was a prophet! So why does it need to say, “He believed in Hashem”? Rashi answers: To tell us that “he did not [even] ask of Him a sign<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” If you ask: Why did Avraham not ask for a sign regarding the promise of children, as he did regarding the inheritance of the Land? The @ITRamban@it answers: [The promise of children was between him and Hashem. But inheriting the land was dependent on the sins of the Canaanite inhabitants, thus Avraham asked for a sign.] The @ITRe’m@it answers: At this point, inheriting the land was merely told to Avraham, not promised: “I am Adonoy who brought you out of Ur Kasdim @ITwith the intention@it to give you this land as an inheritance.” Avraham asked for a sign because this promise was not definite. But the promise of children was a definite promise and therefore he did not need a sign. But it seems to me that he did not request a sign for children because it is written (v. 5), “He took him outside and said: ‘@ITLook@it .<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.’” And this is interpreted in Shabbos 156a to mean: “God said to him, ‘Leave your astrological calculations .<TIE>.<TIE>. It is @ITAvram@it who will have no son, but @ITAvraham will@it have a son.’” Once Avram saw this marvel, he no longer needed a sign. But the inheritance of the Land was not [seen]; thus Avraham requested a sign. A further answer: Avram had doubt about inheriting the Land because Hashem did not include the promise regarding the inheritance of the Land together with the promise of children. Rather He separated the two. This cast a doubt in Avraham’s heart. (@ITMinchas Yehudah@it) According to Rashi the phrase @hh<HEB>והאמין בה'@ee<ENG> seems to be unnecessary. It is obvious that Avram believed the promise of children, since he said nothing when Hashem promised him this. Therefore Rashi commented, “Concerning the inheritance of the Land he asked for a sign.” Rashi explains that @hh<HEB>והאמין בה'@ee<ENG> was written to infer from it: He believed @ITthis,@it and did not ask for a sign. But [for inheriting the Land] .<TIE>.<TIE>. (@ITR. Yaakov Kenizal@it) @BOGod considered it for Avram.<TIE>.<TIE>. @boRashi is explaining that Hashem accounted @hh<HEB>צדקה@ee<ENG> to Avram, not Avram to Hashem. Rashi knows this because the greater one grants @hh<HEB>צדקה@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>חסד@ee<ENG> to the lesser one, not the reverse. (@ITRe’m@it) [Alternatively,] Rashi knows this because if it meant that Avram accounted @hh<HEB>צדקה@ee<ENG> to Hashem, it would be obvious. For even if he did not see in the stars that he will be childless, he would still consider [having children] a @hh<HEB>צדקה@ee<ENG>, and would not say that he deserved it — all the more so that the stars were against it. This is why Rashi explains that “God considered it for Avram.” (@ITR. Yaakov Kenizal@it) @BOBy what merit will they remain in it? @boAccordingly, that verse is understood as if it said @hh<HEB>אדע במה אירשנה@ee<ENG> —“Let me know by what merit I shall inherit it.” The @ITRe’m@it writes: According to this explanation, I do not know how Rashi will explain @hh<HEB>והאמין בה'@ee<ENG>, for the [original] question stands: would we think that Avram might not believe in his own prophecy? The @ITRe’m@it answers: Avram believed he would have children, without puzzling over it. But he puzzled over inheriting the land — by what merit will his descendants remain in it? But it seems to me [the answer is]: He believed his children would continue to exist even without merit, for v. 10 says, “The bird, however, he did not split.” And Rashi comments there, citing @ITChazal@it: “This signifies that Israel will exist forever.” Similarly it is written (Devarim 32:23), “I will use up My arrows on them,” and @ITChazal@it comment (Sotah 9a): “My arrows may come to an end, but Israel will not come to an end.” Whereas for the Land, he believed they would [initially] inherit it, because the merit of their forefathers would be sufficient for this, as Rashi says at the beginning of Parshas Va’eira. But he had doubt whether they would have the merit to keep it. Thus he said, “How will I know?” I.e., by what merit will my descendants keep the Land? @p1[9]@p2<TIE>Symbolic of the goat that is offered inside.<TIE>.<TIE>. @p3[The individual’s sin offering] does not come to atone for all of Israel as do the other bulls and goats mentioned. Yet, since it can be brought by anyone who sins, it is considered as atonement for all of Israel. (@ITRe’m@it) But it seems to me that it serves as atonement for all of Israel because there is no one who is completely righteous, who does only good and never sins, [therefore it is considered as atonement for all of Israel.]<QC>
@p1[11]@p2<TIE>On the pieces. @p3Rashi explains this because the term @hh<HEB>פגרים@ee<ENG> usually refers to complete bodies, while here the bodies were split into two. Therefore Rashi says that here @hh<HEB>הפגרים@ee<ENG> means “the pieces.” Rashi is thereby telling us that the vultures did not descend also on the birds, [which were not split]. For that would make it seem as if Israel too would be annihilated as the birds symbolize Yisrael [see Rashi on v. 10]. Thus Rashi explains that @hh<HEB>הבתרים@ee<ENG> means the [split] pieces, which symbolize the nations [@ITibid@it]. (@ITR. Yaakov Kenizal@it)<QC>
@p1[13]@p2<TIE>That Kehos lived after Amram’s birth .<TIE>.<TIE>. @p3Also, [you must subtract] Kehos’s years before he descended to Egypt. Since the enslavement itself was not 400 years, we are forced to say that “for four hundred years” refers to “your descendants will be foreigners in a land that is not theirs,” rather than to “they will enslave them and oppress them.” Indeed, from the time Yitzchok was born, they were as foreigners in various lands, as it is written (Bereishis@IT @it26:6): “Yitzchok settled in Gerar.” [And there are many verses that] use the term @hh<HEB>ויגר@ee<ENG>, which connotes being a foreigner. Although the enslavement was only for 210 years, they were foreigners from the time Yitzchok was born. @BOIt does not state, “In the Land of Egypt” .<TIE>.<TIE>. @boRather it is written, “In a land that is not theirs” — as they [resided in various lands that were not theirs and] did not descend to Egypt until the end of Yaakov’s life. @p1[14]@p2<TIE>@HB<HEB>וגם@BO<ENG> includes the Four Kingdoms.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo They were hinted to above in v. 12: @hh<HEB>והנה אימה חשיכה גדולה נופלת עליו@ee<ENG>. @hh<HEB>אימה@ee<ENG> is Bavel. @hh<HEB>חשיכה@ee<ENG> is Medai, who darkened Israel’s eyes by [causing them] to fast. @hh<HEB>גדולה@ee<ENG> is Greece, and @hh<HEB>נופלת@ee<ENG> is Edom [i.e., Rome]. @BOWith ten plagues. @boAs opposed to with actual judgment, for it does not say anywhere that Hashem judged them. @BOWith much money@bo .<TIE>.<TIE>. [Rashi carifies this because] @hh<HEB>רכוש@ee<ENG> usually means possessions [such as cattle and flocks]. But here the @hh<HEB>רכוש@ee<ENG> [the Egyptians] lent them was money, not the customary @hh<HEB>רכוש@ee<ENG> = possessions. @p1[15]@p2 And will, therefore, not witness all this@p3. I.e., the enslavement and the oppression. But being a foreigner applied to Avraham as well, since the 400 years began immediately upon Yitzchok’s birth, as Rashi said on v. 13. @BOHis father was an idol-worshipper and He foretells that he will join him .<TIE>.<TIE>. @boThis is a statement, not a rhetorical question. For Rashi does not say afterwards, “@ITRather, @itthis teaches you .<TIE>.<TIE>. (@ITMaharshal@it) @BOAnd on that very day that Eisav rebelled@bo. As it is written (25:29), “When Eisav came in from the field, exhausted,” on which @ITChazal@it comment (Bereishis Rabbah 63:12): “[Exhausted] as a result of committing murder.” And that was the day Avraham died. (@ITKitzur Mizrachi@it)<QC>
@p1[16]@p2<TIE>And Calev son of Chetzron was of those who entered the Land@p3. You might ask: Was Calev not the @ITfifth@it generation? Since Yaakov himself descended to Egypt, it was 1) Yaakov, 2) Yehudah, 3) Peretz, 4) Chetzron, and 5) Calev. The answer is: Yaakov was very aged; he was considered as if dead and did not count as a generation. Furthermore, there was no enslavement at all in the days of Yaakov. Only in the days of Yehudah did some of the enslavement begin, as Rashi explains in Parshas Vayechi (47:28). Accordingly, “They will enslave them and oppress them” (v. 13) is connected to, “The fourth generation.” @p1[17]@p2<TIE>This is similar to @p3@hh<HEB>ויהי הם מריקים שקיהם@ee@BO<ENG> .<TIE>.<TIE>. @bo Rashi is answering the question: Why is it written @hb<HEB>וי@hhהי@ee<ENG>, masculine? @hh<HEB>שמש@ee<ENG> is feminine, as it is written @hh<HEB>באה@ee<ENG>, thus it should say @hb<HEB>ות@hhהי השמש@ee<ENG>. Rashi answers that it means, “This thing happened (@hh<HEB>ויהי דבר זה@ee<ENG>), that the sun set.” So @hh<HEB>ויהי@ee<ENG> refers to [the implied phrase] @hh<HEB>דבר זה@ee<ENG>, similar to (Bereishis 42:35) @hh<HEB>ויהי הם מריקים שקיהם@ee<ENG> , which means: “This thing happened (@hh<HEB>ויהי דבר זה@ee<ENG>), that they were emptying their sacks.” @p1[20]@p2 The Land of Og about which it is said@p3 .<TIE>.<TIE>. It seems that Og, although he was actually an Emorite — as it is written about [Sichon and Og], “Two kings of the Emorites” (Devarim 3:8) — was king of the Chivites who are the Refa’im. And Og who was an Emorite, is called “remnant of the Refa’im” (@ITibid@it) because he was their king. But if you say “the Refa’im” means [the Land of] Og, and all of them were Emorites, then why does it say (v. 21), “the Emorites”? The Emorites were already accounted for by, “the Refa’im”. (@ITRe’m@it) @p1[1]@p2<TIE>She was Pharaoh’s daughter .<TIE>.<TIE>. @p3 Rashi knows this because it is written @hh<HEB>לה שפחה@ee<ENG>, even though everything a woman acquires belongs to her husband, [so Hagar really belonged to Avraham]. It must be that Hagar was Pharaoh’s daughter and he gave her to Sarah. Therefore it is written @hh<HEB>ולה שפחה@ee<ENG> to hint to the miracles performed “@hh<HEB>לה@ee<ENG>” — for Sarah — which Pharaoh saw. @p1[2]@p2<TIE>Because of the merit of admitting my rival into my home@p3. I.e., [Rashi is answering the question:] If Hagar gives birth, does this make Sarah built-up? Rashi answers: “Through her” means, “As a result of [what I do for] her.” @BOTo the prophecy that was within her. @boRashi knows this because it is written, “To the @ITvoice@it of Sarai,” rather than just, “To Sarai.” Thus it means [that Avraham listened] to the voice that came @ITto@it Sarai, i.e., her prophecy. @p1[3]@p2<TIE>She took her with words .<TIE>.<TIE>. @p3 [Rashi knows this]@BO @bobecause the mind is the main part of a person, and one can “take” a person’s mind only with good words that draw his mind to what one wants. @BOThe time allotted to a woman .<TIE>.<TIE>. @bo Otherwise why does it say, “At the end of ten years”? @p1[4]@p2<TIE>From the first marital union@p3. You might ask: How does Rashi know this? The answer is: Because it is written, “He came to @ITHagar@it and she conceived,” rather than simply, “He came to @ITher@it and she conceived.” It says “Hagar” to indicate that she was still being called Hagar when she conceived. That is, she conceived from the very first union. But other women do not so conceive [from he first union], and Hagar’s conception from the first union was a miracle. This is preferable to @ITRe’m’s @itexplanation that she [previously had] taken action and deflowered herself [thus allowing her to conceive]. @BOI have become pregnant from the first union@bo. You might ask: How does Rashi know that Sarai became slighted in her eyes because she conceived from the first union? Perhaps the very fact that she conceived was the reason! The answer is: Then it should say, “She conceived and her mistress became slighted in her eyes,” [without the intervening phrase, “When she realized she was pregnant”]. A further answer: If it was just because she conceived, Sarai would not be slighted in her eyes, as perhaps Sarai never became pregnant simply because she was barren. But if Hagar conceived [miraculously] from the first union, the verse is understandable. She reasoned: “Sarah surely is not righteous. For if she was, why did her merit not help [to bring a miracle]? If I conceived from the first union, unlike any other woman [and Sarah did not], it is clear that she has no merit.” (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1[5]@p2<TIE>I call for you to be punished@p3. [@hh<HEB>חמסי@ee<ENG> means “my wrong”] and does not mean, “The wrong that I am doing,” as the suffix @hh<HEB>י@ee<ENG> refers to the subject, who is Sarah. [When Rashi says,] “Furthermore: You have unrightfully withheld your words from me,” this is an alternate explanation. @BOFor you have heard my shame and remained silent@bo. I.e., [you heard my shame] from Hagar, as the verse continues and states: “I gave my maid to you and .<TIE>.<TIE>. I became slighted in her eyes.” @BOEvery @HB<HEB>ביניך@BO<ENG> that appears in Scripture is lacking but, here, it is “full.” @boMeaning, [usually] it is written @hh<HEB>בֵּינְךָ@ee<ENG>, second-person masculine. But here it is written @hh<HEB>ביניך@ee<ENG>, which may be read @hh<HEB>בֵינֵיךְ@ee<ENG>, second-person feminine, addressing Hagar. I.e., Sarah was speaking to Hagar as well. @p1[8]@p2<TIE>Where is the place about which you can say .<TIE>.<TIE>. @p3Otherwise it should say @hh<HEB>מאיזה@ee<ENG>, and the @hh<HEB>מ@ee<ENG> at the beginning of the word would indicate a question, as in (Shoftim 17:9): @hh<HEB>מאין תבוא@ee<ENG>, “From where do you come?” @p1[11]@p2<TIE>When you return you will conceive@p3 .<TIE>.<TIE>. He did not tell her of the pregnancy that was, for she had already miscarried, as Rashi explained earlier (v. 5). @BOAs if it were written @bo@hh<HEB>ויולדת@ee@BO<ENG>.<TIE>.<TIE>. @boI.e., @hh<HEB>יוֹלֶדֶת@ee<ENG>, which is present tense. [Rashi is saying:] Do not be surprised by the @hh<HEB>שוא@ee<ENG> under the @hh<HEB>ת@ee<ENG>, for it is similar to (Yirmeyahu 22:23):@hh<HEB>יושבת בלבנון מקוננת בארזים@ee<ENG>, which also are present tense, and have a @hh<HEB>שוא@ee<ENG> under the @hh<HEB>ת@ee<ENG>. @BOThis is a command .<TIE>.<TIE>. @boI.e., although it is written @hh<HEB>וְקָרָאת@ee<ENG> without a @hh<HEB>שוא@ee<ENG> under the @hh<HEB>ת@ee<ENG>, it still is a command, just as one would say @hh<HEB>וְקָרָאתָ@ee<ENG> when addressing a male. @p1[12]@p2<TIE>Loves the wilderness to hunt wild animals .<TIE>.<TIE>. @p3 He is called @hh<HEB>פרא@ee<ENG> as in the verse (Iyov 24:5): “@hh<HEB>פראים במדבר@ee<ENG> (wild donkeys in the desert).” This follows R. Yochanan’s view in Bereishis Rabbah 45:9. Accordingly, it makes sense that @hh<HEB>ידו בכל@ee<ENG> means: “a robber.” But according to Reish Lakish, who explains @hh<HEB>פרא אדם@ee<ENG> to mean “kidnapper,” @hh<HEB>ידו בכל@ee<ENG> will need to bear a different and far-fetched explanation. @p1[13]@p2<TIE>He sees the humiliation of the humiliated@p3. [Hagar was saying:] “Granted, I saw angels in the house of Avraham, due to Avraham and Sarah’s righteousness — but why in the wilderness? It must be that, ‘He sees the humiliation<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.’” (@ITGur Aryeh@it) @p1[15]@p2<TIE>The spirit of prophecy rested upon him@p3. For if Avraham heard [the name] from Hagar [and then named him, this would be difficult to understand, for] @ITshe@it should have named him Yishmael, as she was commanded [regarding this name,] and not he. Perforce, the spirit of prophecy rested upon him, and he was as if commanded. (@ITGur Aryeh@it) @p1[16]@p2<TIE>To let us know that he was thirteen years old .<TIE>.<TIE>. @p3For Avraham was 99 when he circumcised Yishmael, and he was 86 when Yishmael was born. You might ask: [If the reason is as Rashi says,] why is it expressly written, “And his son Yishmael was 13 years old when he circumcised<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (17:25)? The answer is: Scripture repeats it to emphasize that Yishmael circumcised himself because of Hashem’s mitzvah, not from fear of his father who obliged him to do it. But the @ITMahara’i@it answers: We would not know from v. 17:25 that Yishmael was a full 13 years old, which is the age of attaining maturity, [for it could mean he was just over 12, and thus still a minor,] and that is why he did not resist. But the verse here makes the point clear. @p1[1]@p2<TIE>I am the One Whose Godliness suffices@p3. Avraham had said to Hashem: “If I circumcise myself, people will regard me with disgust!” Hashem answered him: “I am the One Who said to My world: It suffices<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (@ITMaharshal@it) @BOThis, too, is an imperative following an imperative, “Be perfect<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @bo[Rashi is answering the question:] Since it is already written, “Walk before Me,” what was added by, “And be perfect”? Rashi explains that this, too, is a command. It is one imperative following another, saying: “Be perfect in all My tests.” @BONow you are lacking five organs .<TIE>.<TIE>. @bo The @ITRe’m@it writes: These organs, over which a person lacks full control, lead him to sin. But because of Avraham’s great righteousness, Hashem gave him control over them. For it is written (Shmuel I, 2:9), “The feet of His pious ones He will guard”: when one overcomes one’s @ITyetzer hara,@it in the end Hashem gives one full control over it [see @ITYoma @it38b]. @BOTwo eyes@bo .<TIE>.<TIE>. You might ask: Could Avraham really have lacked all these organs? The answer is: Surely he had them, but since he did not control them, it was as if he lacked them. Hashem now told him that they would all be under his control. Question: Did Avraham not lack the heart as well, as he was still uncircumcised of heart? The answer is: Only external organs are counted here. Furthermore, it is written in Nechemiah 9:8: “You found his [Avraham’s] heart faithful before You. And [then] You made the @ITbris@it with him.” We see that even before circumcision, Avraham’s heart was hardly [considered as] uncircumcised. (@ITMaharshal@it)<QC>
@p1[3]@p2<TIE>From fear of the Divine Presence .<TIE>.<TIE>. @p3 [You might ask:] When it is written earlier (12:7), “Adonoy appeared to Avram,” why is it not written that he fell on his face? The answer is: He fell on his face then as well, as derived from here. And falling on his face was not mentioned until now to show the difference between before circumcision and after. For after his circumcision, it is written (18:22): “Avraham was still @ITstanding@it before Hashem.” @p1[5]@p2<TIE>For even the @HB<HEB>י@BO<ENG> of Sarai’s name complained to the Divine Presence .<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: ]According to this,] he should have been called @hh<HEB>אבהם@ee<ENG>, replacing the @hh<HEB>ר@ee<ENG> with a @hh<HEB>ה@ee<ENG>. Why was the @hh<HEB>ר@ee<ENG> not removed? Rashi answers: So the @hh<HEB>ר@ee<ENG> will not complain to Hashem, as did the@hh<HEB>י @ee<ENG> of Sarai. And perhaps the reason the@hh<HEB>י @ee<ENG> of Sarai was removed was because it was destined to be placed in Yehoshua’s name. Furthermore, the@hh<HEB> י @ee<ENG>[which equals 10] remained also with Sarai, as it was divided: half [@hh<HEB>ה@ee<ENG> = 5] was given to Sarah, and half to Avraham. But the @hh<HEB>ר@ee<ENG> could not have remained in their names [in this way].<QC>
@p1[8]@p2<TIE>But, one who resides outside Eretz Yisrael is like someone who has no God. @p3R. Noson writes: This is because Eretz Yisrael is Hashem’s inheritance. He took it as His portion, as it says in a number of verses; the other lands were apportioned to the archangels. Thus, whoever resides in other lands is considered as though he has removed himself from Hashem’s domain, so to speak. And these are the words of @ITGur Aryeh@it. @p1[10]@p2<TIE>As if it were written @HB<HEB>להמול@ee@BO<ENG> .<TIE>.<TIE>. @bo[I.e.,] although it is in the imperative form, it cannot be a command. For the next verse states [the command]: “You shall circumcise<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1[11]@p2<TIE>As @HB<HEB>ומלתם@ee<ENG> .<TIE>.<TIE>. I.e., although it is not in the imperative form, it is a command. @BOBut @HB<HEB>ימול@BO<ENG> is the form @HB<HEB>יִפָrֵל@ee@BO<ENG>. @boI.e., [it is the passive form,] referring to the one who is being circumcised, not the circumciser, as in @hh<HEB>ונמלתם@ee<ENG>. Otherwise the verse would be lacking the active party. @BOAs in @HB<HEB>יעשה יאכל@BO<ENG>. @boThe words @hh<HEB>יעשה יאכל@ee<ENG> are vocalized with a @hh<HEB>צירי@ee<ENG> under the @hh<HEB>י@ee<ENG>. @p1[13]@p2<TIE>Here is repeated@p3 .<TIE>.<TIE>. Above (v. 12) it is also written, “Every male throughout your generations he that is a house-born slave<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” and it specified: “At the age of eight days.” Here it repeats “house-born slaves” but does not specify [the age]. @BOThere is a @HB<HEB>יליד בית@BO<ENG> that is circumcised on the first@bo. I.e., on the first day. This case is explained in Shabbos 135b: Two people jointly bought a pregnant maidservant. One bought the maidservant herself, and the other, the embryo. [Note: This entry relates to a phrase that was once printed in Rashi’s commentary.] @BOAfter eight days@bo .<TIE>.<TIE>. This case is: One person bought a pregnant maidservant. If she gave birth on Shabbos, the circumcision does not override Shabbos [i.e., the circumcision does not take place on the eighth day]. @p1[14]@p2<TIE>Teaches that circumcision is where there is a distinction@p3 .<TIE>.<TIE>. The @ITRe’m @itwrites: Otherwise, why does it say @hh<HEB>זכר@ee<ENG>? But it seems to me that Rashi’s proof is as follows: It should have said @hh<HEB>וזכר ערל@ee<ENG>, but did not, because that would imply the command is directed to males, not to females — even though the command could be relevant to females as well. In that case, the verse would not come to teach the place of circumcision. But since it is written @hh<HEB>וערל זכר@ee<ENG>, it implies that the verse is indeed teaching the place of circumcision, and telling us that the @hh<HEB>ערלה@ee<ENG> is in the place that distinguishes between male and female. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @BOOne who has reached the age of punishment and then he shall be excised@bo .<TIE>.<TIE>. For if he is still a minor and not liable for punishment, why should he be excised? @p1[16]@p2<TIE>What is this blessing? She reverted to her youthfulness .<TIE>.<TIE>. @p3Otherwise, why does it say, “I will bless her,” and only then, “And I will also give you a son through her”? Perforce, “I will bless her” refers to the blessing that comes before [having children]: which is youthfulness. @BOThe ability to breastfeed@bo .<TIE>.<TIE>. Otherwise, why after [mentioning] the birth of her son does it say further: “I will bless her”? Every woman after birth is able to nurse her child, and so too Sarah, since she reverted to her youthfulness. Therefore Rashi explains, “When she needed this ability<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”<QC>
@p1[17]@p2<TIE>There are expressions of astonishment that affirm@p3 .<TIE>.<TIE>. I.e., they do not deny the matter. Avraham meant: “Hashem can do anything, even against the laws of nature, but not everyone merits that Hashem should bestow upon him such kindness!” [You might ask:] Rashi later writes: @hh<HEB>וכך אמר בלבו הנעשה חסד זה לאחר מה שהקב"ה עושה לי@ee<ENG>. Is this not an expression of astonishment that denies? The answer is: Avraham was not denying the matter, claiming it could not be. Rather, he was praising Hashem for bestowing upon him more kindness than He does anyone else. So it seems to me; this explanation is preferable to the @ITRe’m’s.@it @BOIn the days of Avraham, life was already shorter .<TIE>.<TIE>. @bo[Rashi is answering the question:] Why was Avraham surprised that Sarah should give birth at 90?] The@BO @bo@ITRe’m@it writes: I do not understand Rashi’s answer. Although life was shorter in Avraham’s days, the question stands: Avraham’s age of 100 when compared to his lifespan of 175 is about the same as an age of 500 when compared to Noach’s lifespan of 950. Thus, Avraham should not have been surprised. The @ITRe’m @itelaborated on this difficulty. But it seems to me that Avraham’s surprise was because they both were old. An elderly man can beget children if his wife is young, whereas if they both are elderly it is surprising. This resolves the @ITRe’m’s@it difficulty. The @ITRe’m @italso asks: Why did Rashi base his question on Noach? Noach [was different, because] Hashem decreed that he should not be able to beget children, so that his [oldest] son would not reach punishable age before the Flood. The answer is: Hashem decreed only that he should not beget [until then]. But the fact that he was able to beget at 500 was natural. @BOWho gave birth at the early age of 60-70. @boMeaning: Previously, people could not have children until age 100, for in those days a 100-year-old was still a youth, like today’s 13-year-old. Then their lifespan shortened and they began to have children at 30. The fact that Avraham begat at 100 does not raise any question. The astonishment is mainly over the fact that an elderly man who had become weak and an elderly woman would beget children. This answers all the @ITRe’m’s @itquestions. I found the @ITMaharshal @itcited in a similar vein. @p1[18]@p2<TIE>I am unworthy to receive such a reward. @p3I.e., the verse does not mean that Avraham was displeased by the promise of Yitzchok’s birth.<QC>
@BOThat he live in fear of You@bo .<TIE>.<TIE>. You might ask: How could Avraham pray for fear of Heaven? It is stated in Megillah 25a, “Everything is in the hands of Heaven except for fear of Heaven”! The answer is: Avraham prayed only that Yishmael should live. Whereas “Before You” conveys that it is good for Yishmael to live in fear of You. [But @ITRe’m @itexplains that it is indeed] two requests: First, that Yishmael should live, and second, to have fear of Him. For otherwise, why does it say @hh<HEB>לפניך@ee<ENG>? But the @ITNachalas Yaakov@it says: It seems to me that “In fear of You” means: if Yishmael will be righteous [then I pray he should live]. But if he will be wicked, I do not intervene on behalf of the wicked, and have no request. @p1[19]@p2<TIE>Based on the laughter. Some say, based on the ten trials@p3. Both explanations are needed. For if he was so named because of laughter [alone], his name should be @hh<HEB>צחוק@ee<ENG>. Why is there a @hh<HEB>י@ee<ENG>? Perforce, it is because of the ten trials. And this entails saying that @hh<HEB>ח@ee<ENG> is for circumcision performed on the 8th day, and @hh<HEB>צ@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>ק@ee<ENG> are for Sarah’s 90 years and Avraham’s 100. But this explanation alone is insufficient, for it says clearly (21:6): “God has given me laughter,” indicating he was so named because of laughter. (@ITGur Aryeh@it)<QC>
@p1[20]@p2<TIE>They will dissipate like clouds@p3 .<TIE>.<TIE>. Otherwise, why are they not called @hh<HEB>שבטים@ee<ENG> as are Yaakov’s sons, connoting might, or why are they not called ministers and chiefs? Perforce, @hh<HEB>נשיאים@ee<ENG> [hints that they will dissipate like clouds]. (@ITKitzur Mizrachi@it)<QC>
@p1[23]@p2 This is the @p3@hh<HEB>ויפעל@ee@BO<ENG> form@bo. [Rashi is explaining that] even though the @ITyud@it has a @ITdagesh@it, it is not the intensified form [called @ITpi’el@it], but the simple form [called @ITpa’al@it]. It means he circumcised others. @p1[24]@p2<TIE>In the @p3@hh<HEB>בהפעלו@ee@BO<ENG> form, the same as @bo@hh<HEB>בהבראם@ee<ENG>. This is the passive form, meaning he was circumcised, just as @hh<HEB>בהבראם@ee<ENG> (2:4) means they were created, which is also in the passive form.<QC>
@p1[25]@p2<TIE>Therefore, concerning him @p3@hh<HEB>את@ee@BO<ENG> is said. @boThe words @hh<HEB>את@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>גם@ee<ENG> always come to add something. Although it is stated in Yevamos 71b that Avraham was not commanded to do @hh<HEB>פריעה@ee<ENG>, he did it on his own just as he kept the whole Torah on his own. But regarding @hh<HEB>מילה@ee<ENG> he waited since he knew he was destined to be commanded, and then he could do it in fulfillment of a command, [which is more praiseworthy]. (@ITKitzur Mizrachi@it) @p1[26]@p2<TIE>That Avraham turned ninety-nine. @p3You might ask: In v. 23 it is already written, “On that very day,” on which Rashi commented, “On the same day that he was commanded.” And in the next verse it is written, “Avraham was 99 years old.” [Why then is his age repeated here?] The answer is: Otherwise we might have thought that Avraham was over 98 but not yet 99, although it is written “Avraham was 99 years old,” because part of a year is considered as a whole year. Thus it is repeated “On that very day” to teach that [they were circumcised] on the day Avraham turned 99, and Yishmael turned 13.<QC>
@p1[1]@p2<TIE>To visit the sick person@p3. You might ask: How did Rashi know this? The answer is: Because it is written, “Hashem appeared to @IThim@it,” rather than, “Hashem appeared to @ITAvraham@it.” [And why is this?] Perforce, it does not mention Avraham explicitly because it relates back to the previous passage regarding the bris milah, where it is expressly written, “To Avraham.” If so, why did Hashem appear to him now? Not to command him about milah—as He already commanded him, and he already performed milah on himself and on the members of his household. It must be that [since Avraham was sick due to the milah,] He came to visit the sick. Alternatively, Rashi knew this because the verse does not go on to explain why Hashem appeared to him. Thus we may assume it was to visit the sick. Question: Why does Rashi say, “To visit the sick person,” rather than simply saying, “To visit him”? [The answer is:] Because we learn from here the mitzvah of visiting the sick, as it says in Bava Metzia 86b. Since it was not limited to Avraham, Rashi says: “To visit the sick person.” @p1@p2It was the third day since his circumcision<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because He appeared to him in order to visit him, thus it makes sense that it was on the third day, since he was in the most pain then. For it says (34:25): “On the third day when they were in pain.” The @ITRe’m@it asks: On the contrary, the danger on the third day is less than the danger during the first two days, for it says in Shabbos 134b that [according to the first Tanna] we may wash a circumcised infant [with warm water on Shabbos during the first two days after milah, but not on the third day, when he is in less danger]. If so, how did R. Chama bar Chanina [cited by Rashi] know that He appeared to Avraham was on the third day? Perhaps it was on the second day! Granted it was not the first day, when he was busy doing his own milah and that of his servants, but perhaps it was the second day. It seems to me that the answer is: The Tannaim (@ITibid.@it) only disagree regarding the milah of an infant, who is more exposed to danger on the first and second day than on the third day. The first Tanna holds that an infant’s wound heals very quickly [and the third day poses less danger]. Whereas R. Eliezer holds there is no difference between the first two days and the third day, and cites the verse, [“On the third day when they were in pain,” about the men of Shechem,] although it is not conclusive proof. But for the milah of an adult, all agree that the third day poses a greater danger than the first two. For the verse testifies: “On the third day when they were in pain,” which Onkelos explains as, “When their pains were the strongest.” And so the Rambam explains the third day’s pains (Peirush HaMishnayos, Shabbos 19:3): “Fluids flow down and create swelling, increasing the pain.” It is likely that an infant is different in this respect, as he has less fluid. His danger is the wound itself, thus on the third day his danger is less, since his wound heals quickly. But an adult’s wound is not as dangerous in itself, for he can withstand a knife wound, as is well known. [His danger is from] the fluids, which do not accumulate so much at first. It seems to me that the answer is: The Halachah states (Yoreh De’ah 335) that one should not visit the sick person on the first two days. [Therefore, it must have been the third day.] (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) The @ITRe’m@it asked: On v. 18:6, “Knead it and make cake-rolls,” the Midrash commented (Bereishis Rabba 48:12): “It was Erev Pesach.” And so it says in v. 19:3 [regarding Lot], “He baked matzos,” upon which Rashi himself comments: “It was Pesach.” Thus the Midrash must be of the opinion that Hashem visited Avraham on the very day of the milah, the fifteenth of Nisan, [since Yitzchok was born one year from the milah (see 17:21), and was born on the fifteenth of Nisan (see Rashi, 18:10). And since Hashem’s visit was Erev Pesach after noon, it was considered the fifteenth of Nisan]. But R. Chama [cited by Rashi here] is of the opinion that the visit was on the seventeenth of Nisan, [which is the third day]. If so, why did Rashi cite conflicting Aggados? The @ITRe’m@it elaborated but did not explain it well. It seems to me that the answer is simple: According to all opinions, the milah was on the twelfth of Nisan, and the visit was on the fifteenth of Nisan. And, [as Rashi mentioned on 21:2,] the angel scratched a mark on the wall [to mark the date]. This was done on the 16th, [so as not to desecrate Yom Tov]. At that point Hashem said (v. 14): “At the appointed time (@hh<HEB>למועד@ee<ENG>) I shall return,” [referring to the 15th of Nisan of the coming year. You might ask:] On the day of the milah it said (17:21): @hh<HEB>למועד הזה@ee<ENG>, but on the day of Hashem’s visit it says: @hh<HEB>למועד@ee<ENG>, without @hh<HEB>הזה@ee<ENG>. [If so, why was Yitzchok born the following year on the day of the visit, rather than on the day of the milah? The answer is]: Rashi explained on v. 14 as follows: “@hh<HEB>למועד@ee<ENG>, i.e., on the @hh<HEB>מועד@ee<ENG> that I previously set for you when I said (17:21), ‘@hh<HEB>למועד הזה@ee<ENG> next year.’” And the reference works in reverse as well: when Hashem said on the day of the milah: “@hh<HEB>למועד הזה@ee<ENG> next year,” it actually referred to the day of the visit. And so Rashi explained on 21:2 [that it refers to the day of the visit]; see Rashi there. @p1@p2Therefore, He appeared to him in his territory@p3. It seems that Rashi is not attempting to answer the question of why Hashem appeared to Avraham specifically there, as Avraham might have simply happened to be there at the time [when Hashem chose to appear]. Rather, Rashi is answering the question: Why does Scripture need to @ITinform@it us that Hashem appeared to him there, [when we would know this on our own? For] it already said that Avraham dwelled in the groves of Mamrei. Assumedly, Hashem appeared to him there, since that is where he circumcised himself and his household. And he surely did not leave, as he was still recovering from the milah; in fact Hashem came to visit him [for that reason]. The @ITRe’m@it asks: How did Rashi know that Mamrei advised him? Perhaps Hashem appeared to Avraham there simply because Avraham’s tent was there on that day. He answers: Rashi knew it from the extra phrase, [“In the groves of Mamrei”]. It could have said simply, “Adonoy appeared to him and he was sitting<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” as it does for other prophecies, [where the place is not mentioned]. This answer is similar to what I explained above. Alternatively: Rashi knew [that Mamrei advised Avraham] because it said in Parshas Lech Lecha (14:13), @hh<HEB>באלוני ממרא האמורי@ee<ENG>. And @hh<HEB>האמורי@ee<ENG> implies that Mamrei said (@hh<HEB>אמר@ee<ENG>) to Avraham to perform Hashem’s command. Question: How could one suggest that Avraham Avinu asked advice whether or not to fulfill Hashem’s command? Avraham was a great tzaddik who withstood ten trials! The @ITRe’m@it explains that Avraham surely would have done the milah anyway, as commanded by his Creator. Avraham asked Eshkol, Aneir and Mamrei for advice since they were his allies and spoke to them as his friends, but Avraham wanted to test their sincerity. If they will advise him to circumcise, they are sincere friends. In the end, Eshkol and Aneir advised him against circumcising, and only Mamrei advised him to circumcise. Avraham thereby knew what was in their hearts. The @ITRe’m@it offers another answer: Avraham asked their advice because he assumed they would advise him not to circumcise, yet he would do it anyway—making his reward greater. A further answer: Avraham sought advice whether to circumcise himself in private or in public, as he was concerned lest people come and prevent him. Mamrei said to do it publicly, for people will not be able to stop him. This is in accord with 17:23 where it is written @hh<HEB>בעצם היום@ee<ENG>, [on which Rashi comments that Avraham performed the milah openly, without fear of intervention]. (@ITMahari@it) It seems to me [that the answer is]: Avraham asked whether to circumcise in public, as nowhere does it say he was commanded to do it publicly. Aneir and Eshkol were opposed, as it says in Midrash Tanchuma Vayeira 3, while Mamrei enheartened him to circumcise in public, and not to be concerned at all about his enemies. Hashem rewarded Mamrei accordingly, measure for measure, and appeared [to Avraham] in his territory. Although Rashi said in 17:23 that Hashem told Avraham not to fear, that was after Mamrei advised him [not to be concerned about his enemies], to which Hashem concurred. (@ITR. Meir Stern@it) A further answer: The Midrash says that Avraham circumcised Eshkol and Aneir, and they died. Mamrei told [i.e., advised] him: “The others will not survive unless you circumcise yourself.” This is as it says (17:13): @hh<HEB>המל ימול@ee<ENG>, the first word spelled without a @hh<HEB>ו@ee<ENG>, implying that he who circumcises himself (@hh<HEB>הַמָל@ee<ENG>) may circumcise others (@hh<HEB>ימול@ee<ENG>). [See also Yerushalmi, Shabbos 19:2. But in present-day Torah scrolls it is written @hh<HEB>המול@ee<ENG>.] Avraham then began to circumcise himself, but could not [finish], due to the pain. Hashem came and helped him, as it says (Nechemiah 9:8): “@hh<HEB>וכרות עמו הברית@ee<ENG> (and You cut the bris @ITwith him@it).” And since Mamrei advised him regarding the milah, Hashem appeared to him in Mamrei’s territory. Question: If Hashem would not appear to Avraham in Mamrei’s territory, where would He appear? Avraham dwelled in Mamrei’s territory! The answer is: Hashem caused Avraham to dwell there in order to bring about Mamrei’s reward. You might ask: Why did Avraham seek advice regarding milah, but not regarding any other mitzvah? An answer is: Avraham did not need advice whether to wait until he was commanded [before he fulfilled] the other mitzvos, as he knew he would not be commanded regarding any other mitzvah. An alternative answer: Even should he be commanded later concerning another mitzvah, this is no reason to refrain from performing it before—as he can always perform it later, in fulfillment of the command. But milah cannot be done a second time. I later heard that this answer is written in @ITMishpetei Shmuel.@it (@ITTzeidah L’Derech@it) @p1@p2It is written @HB<HEB>ישב@BO<TIE><ENG>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is saying that @hh<HEB>יושב@ee<ENG> is present tense. It conveys that Avraham was sitting before, and still is. But @hh<HEB>ישב@ee<ENG> is past tense, and conveys that he was sitting before but not now. If so, [we might ask,] why did he stand? Thus Rashi explains: Avraham wanted to rise, to honor the Shechinah, but Hashem said to him: “Sit<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” This is preferable to the @ITRe’m’s@it explanation, see there. The @ITNachalas Yaakov@it writes: It seems to me that Rashi means that @hh<HEB>יֹשֵב@ee<ENG> lacking a @hh<HEB>ו@ee<ENG> implies that Avraham’s sitting was lacking, as he wanted to rise. The same goes for @hh<HEB>ועפרון יֹשֵב@ee<ENG> (23:10). There, too, Ephron’s sitting [as an officer] was lacking, for they appointed him only that day. @p1@p2And you will symbolize to your descendants that I am destined <TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 It seems that Rashi is answering the question: It says in Moed Katan 27b, “We tell anyone to sit, [after he stands for the Nasi] — except for a mourner and a sick person,” as then it would connote that he should “sit” [i.e., stay] in his mourning or his sickness. And here, Hashem came to visit a sick person. Why did He tell him to sit? Thus Rashi explains: “You will symbolize<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (@ITTzeidah L’Derech@it) @p1@p2To see if there are any passers by that he might invite into his home.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Do sick people usually sit at the door of the tent? They usually sit or lie on a bed [inside]! Thus Rashi explains: “To see<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1@p2God brought the sun out of its sheath<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 You might ask: How does Rashi know this? Perhaps it anyway was a hot day! The answer is: It is written @hb<HEB>כ@hhחם היום@ee<ENG>, rather than @hb<HEB>ב@hhחם היום@ee<ENG>, implying that the heat of the day was @ITlike@it that mentioned elsewhere (Malachi 3:19): “For lo, the day (@hh<HEB>היום@ee<ENG>) comes, glowing like a furnace.” This forced Rashi to explain: “God brought the sun out<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” But it seems to me that [Rashi knew this because] if @hh<HEB>כחום היום@ee<ENG> indicates what time of day it was, Avraham should have sat earlier at the door of the tent to look for passersby to invite. For it says in Berachos 27a and Bereishis Rabbah 48:8 that @hh<HEB>כחום היום@ee<ENG> is the sixth hour, and @hh<HEB>וחם השמש@ee<ENG> (Shemos 16:21) is the fourth hour. And mealtime is at the fourth hour, as it says in Shabbos 10a and Pesachim 12b. Perforce, the verse must be explaining @ITwhy@it he was sitting at the door of the tent, [not @ITwhen@it]. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1@p2He brought the angels to him in the guise of men.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Did Hashem not need anyway to bring the angels, as we see from the story’s continuation? Thus Rashi explains that Hashem indeed needed to bring them anyway — but not in the guise of men. That was for Avraham’s sake. @p1[2]@p2<TIE>One to foretell to Sarah<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Why did Hashem bring three “men,” instead of one angel? He answers: Hashem anyway needed to bring three angels. One to foretell to Sarah<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. @p1@p2You may be convinced of this because in the entire parshah they are mentioned in the plural form@p3. The @ITMaharshal@it objects: This “proof” just begs the question. Perhaps one angel can do multiple missions, and it mentions one [and the same] angel concerning each deed. [The answer is:] I heard from my father and teacher that Rashi is saying as follows: [You might ask:] Perhaps [there were three] because three angels were needed for a single mission? And it is not because an angel is incapable of multiple missions. Rashi answers: “You may be convinced<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1@p2Rephael, who healed Avraham, went from there<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Question: Why does Rashi need to mention this here? The answer is: Rashi says this to answer the following questions. One angel cannot do multiple missions, as seen from the fact that the foretelling to Sarah and the overturning of Sedom are written in the singular, as Rashi explained above. If so, where do we find Avraham’s healing written in the singular? Furthermore, why did Hashem not bring four angels, [the fourth] one to rescue Lot? Thus Rashi explains that Rephael who healed Avraham went to rescue Lot, and Lot’s rescue is written in the singular, as Rashi goes on to say. Therefore it is as though a single angel was also mentioned for Avraham’s healing. (@ITRe’m@it) Furthermore, Rashi is answering the question: Later, concerning the overturning of Sedom, it is written (19:1): “The two angels came to Sedom,” implying that it involved two angels, although one of them had already done his mission [and was incapable of another mission]. Thus Rashi explains: “Rephael who healed Avraham<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” to tell us that one of the angels was Rephael. He only rescued Lot and did not assist in overturning Sedom. Rashi explains that Rephael who healed Avraham went to rescue Lot. You might ask: If so, why did this angel say about himself (19:13), “@ITWe@it are going to destroy”? The answer is: His essential mission was to rescue Lot, but to destroy Sedom was an indirect result [of the rescue]. For it says (19:23-4), “When Lot came to Zoar, Adonoy caused to rain upon Sedom<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” I.e., rescuing Lot indirectly caused the destruction. Thus it is rightly said that an angel of good does no evil, and vice versa. (@ITRa@it) Some versions of Rashi say: “The mission of healing and rescue are one.” Rashi is answering the question: Why three angels? [There are four missions but only three angels, so it seems that an angel can indeed do a second mission if it is in a different place! Therefore,] let the two angels of Avraham’s healing and Sarah’s foretelling go to Sedom. One will overturn Sedom while the other will rescue Lot. Thus Rashi explains that [an angel @ITcannot@it do a second mission in a different place either. Rather,] rescuing and healing are one [mission; they save endangered life. Therefore, it can be done by the same angel]. But foretelling and rescue are two different missions. Other versions of Rashi do not have this. The reason one angel does not perform multiple missions is to demonstrate that Hashem’s legions are countless; where there is wealth there is no scantiness. The @ITNachalas Yaakov@it debated at length, and concluded: It seems clear that Hashem brought three angels so that Avraham would not be aggravated over [lack of] guests, even though one angel can do multiple missions. [You might ask:] If so, why does it state that there were three? Would it matter if there were more, or less? Thus Rashi explains that Scripture informs us that there were three angels to carry out three types of missions. @p1@p2Next to him.@p3 We need not question: If so, [that “over” is respectful], then [below in v. 8] it should say that he stood @ITnext@it to them, [rather than “over them”]. For the answer is: Since there [in v. 8] he is serving them at the meal, it is proper to write he stood “over” them, as it means he was right next to them, ready to serve them immediately. But in this verse this reason does not apply. It says likewise in Pesachim 103b: “Rav Yeiva was standing @ITover@it them to serve them during the meal.” (@ITMahara’i@it) @p1@p2And then it says: “He ran to greet them.”@p3 Some ask: According to the Aggadah that they were close and then moved away, it should say: “He ran @ITafter@it them”! The answer is: Avraham’s tent had four openings. When they went away, he ran from that opening to one in the north or south, to stop them [from leaving]. That is why it says, “[He ran @ITtoward@it them] to greet them.” Another answer is: Angels have no backside, [but multiple faces]. For it says (Yechezkel 1:12): “They did not turn as they walked.” Although these angels were in the guise of men, they retained their trait of seeing what was either in front or behind them. [Thus, Avraham was actually greeting their faces.] (@ITToldos Yitzchok@it) @p1[3]@p2<TIE>He was speaking to their leader<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Why did he first say @hh<HEB>אדנָי@ee<ENG>, the plural form, and then @hh<HEB>אם נא מצאתי חן בעיני@hbךָ@ee<ENG>, the singular form? Rashi answers: He was speaking to their leader [yet referring to them all]. And there is no difference between @hh<HEB>אד@hbנַ@hhי@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>אדנָ@hhי@ee<ENG>; both are plural form. You might ask: How did Avraham know who the leader was? The answer is: He reasoned they were two disciples and a teacher. And normally, the teacher walks in the middle with the greater disciple to his right and the lesser one to his left. @p1@p2Both explanations are in Bereishis Rabbah@p3. I.e., the explanations of whether @hh<HEB>אדני@ee<ENG> is holy or profane—not those of @hh<HEB>לא ידון וכו'@ee<ENG>. (@ITKitzur Mizrachi@it) @p1[4]@p2<TIE>Through an intermediary.@p3 Rashi is not telling us that @hh<HEB>יוקח@ee<ENG> means through an intermediary, as that is obvious. Otherwise it should say @hh<HEB>אקחה@ee<ENG> (I will bring)! Rather, Rashi is telling us that Hashem rewarded his descendants through a messenger. (@ITRa@it) @p1@p2And God rewarded his descendants through a messenger.@p3 But Avraham brought the bread himself, as it says: “I will get bread.” Hashem, too, gave it Himself to Avraham’s descendants, and showered upon them manna. (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1@p2As it is said: “And Moshe raised his hand<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”@p3 The verse Rashi cites, from Bamidbar 20:11, is perplexing: it speaks of punishment [for Moshe’s striking the stone]. Whereas the Gemara in Bava Metzia 86b cites a verse regarding the blessing of Miriam’s Well (Shemos 17:6) “You shall strike the rock,” as Rashi explains there. Also Bereishis Rabbah (48:10) brings a verse of blessing (Bamidbar 21:17): “Ascend, O well; sing to it.” Furthermore, why did Rashi even bring this Midrashic explanation, which is not needed for the plain meaning of the verse? (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1@p2However, Lot, who was not particular, invited them to lodge before<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Why is it written differently here than it is concerning Lot? Here it mentions washing before lodging, but about Lot (19:2) it mentions lodging first. Perforce, [the washing was] because of idolatry, about which Avraham was particular, and Lot was not. Thus Rashi offers this explanation. Question: Perhaps Lot, too, was particular—and he mentioned lodging first because they did not appear to him as Arabs? (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1@p2Under the tree (@HB<HEB>אילן@ee@BO<ENG>)@bo. As opposed to a piece of lumber (@hh<HEB>עץ@ee<ENG>), as in (Devarim 19:5): @hh<HEB>ונשל הברזל מן @hbהעץ@ee<ENG> [which refers to a wooden axe handle]. Rashi explained that here it means “tree” because the verse cannot be saying [that Avraham was inviting the angels to rest] under a piece of lumber. And so Onkelos translates it here as @hh<HEB>אילנא@ee<ENG> (tree) rather than as @hh<HEB>אעא@ee<ENG> (lumber, wood).<QC>
@p1[5]@p2<TIE>Here it is not spelled @HB<HEB>לבבכם@ee@BO<ENG> but @HB<HEB>לבכם@ee@BO<ENG>.@p3 The word @hh<HEB>לבבכם@ee<ENG> (“your hearts”, plural form) is said about two people, as their minds are not the same. This is as the Gemara says (Sanhedrin 38a): “Man was originally created as one individual [in order to minimize divisiveness and strife, such as] that of the thieves and robbers.” In other words, the @ITyetzer hara@it affects man, [making one think differently than the other]. But the angels have no @ITyetzer hara@it, so they are of one mind, and about them it may be said @hh<HEB>לבכם@ee<ENG> (your heart, singular form). (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1@p2After that you may leave@p3. Rashi is answering the question: Does not @hh<HEB>וסעדו לבכם @hbאחר@hh תעברו@ee<ENG> imply that @ITafter@it they leave, they will eat? Thus Rashi explains: “After that” — after eating, “you will pass” — you may leave. @p1@p2For this thing I ask of you<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is saying that @hh<HEB>על כן@ee<ENG> [if taken literally] implies that [from the very beginning] they had intended to eat. And this contradicts what it is written above, “If I have found favor<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. please do not pass by,” implying they came to eat only because Avraham implored them. Thus Rashi explains, “This thing I ask of you<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Accordingly, @hh<HEB>על כן@ee<ENG> is like @hh<HEB>על אשר@ee<ENG>.<QC>
@p1[6]@p2<TIE>The fine flour is used for cakes, the meal is for the starch used by cooks<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: The verse implies that she should knead @hh<HEB>קמח@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>סלת@ee<ENG> together, to make cakes from them. Was Avraham stingy and therefore he did not instruct that the cakes be made from fine flour alone? Thus Rashi explains: Only the fine flour was for the cakes, and the meal<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. @p1[7]@p2<TIE>There were three calves@p3. You might ask: How does Rashi know there were three calves; perhaps there was only one? The answer is: Rashi inferred this since it is written @hh<HEB>בן בקר@ee<ENG>, which means of a tender of age, why then does Scripture write @hh<HEB>רך@ee<ENG> [an apparent redundancy]? Furthermore, why does it say @hb<HEB>ו@hhטוב@ee<ENG> and not simply @hh<HEB>טוב@ee<ENG>? Perforce, there were three: @hh<HEB>בן בקר@ee<ENG> is one, @hh<HEB>רך@ee<ENG> is two, and @hh<HEB>וטוב@ee<ENG> is three. The @ITRe’m@it explains that it should say @hh<HEB>רך טוב@ee<ENG>. Since it says @hb<HEB>ו@hhטוב@ee<ENG>, it must have been written for a homiletical exposition. And since @hh<HEB>טוב@ee<ENG> is meant to be expounded, so too is @hh<HEB>רך@ee<ENG> meant to be expounded. This is based on the Gemara in Bava Metzia 86b. @p1@p2So that he might feed them three tongues together with mustard@p3. You might ask: How does Rashi know he served them tongues? The answer is: Because it explains why Avraham slaughtered three calves for three people, which seems a waste of money. And we cannot simply say it was to honor them, as even [the slaughtering of] one calf is a great honor. Furthermore, the slaughtering of three calves makes them look as if they were gluttons, which is not an honor but a disgrace. Thus Rashi explains that Avraham wished to feed them three tongues. We need not ask: Why were three [tongues needed, when two have enough meat]? For the answer is: The flavor of tongue is uneven. The middle is better, and the bottom is fattier. Avraham wanted to feed them three, so each could eat what he wished or what the others ate. [Furthermore,] Avraham otherwise would have had to cut the tongues, and the [irregular] pieces would not be fit to be received by such important guests. Rashi mentions mustard because, as he explains on Bava Metzia 86b, [tongue with mustard] is a delicacy of kings and ministers. (@ITGur Aryeh@it) Three calves were needed in order to serve them similar portions, so as not to cause jealousy at the meal: Avraham held them all equal in honor. (@ITAkeidah@it) @p1@p2This refers to Yishmael, to train him in mitzvos.@p3 Rashi inferred this since it is written @hb<HEB>ה@hhנער@ee<ENG>, meaning the abovementioned lad: Yishmael. But it seems to me that [Rashi knew this] because Avraham ran to the cattle himself. If so, why did he let someone else complete the mitzvah? Therefore Rashi explains that [the someone else] was his son, [and Avraham did this] to train him. (@ITR. Yaakov Kenizal@it) [Furthermore,] Rashi is answering the question: Why was Avraham not punished for giving it to the lad, as he was for having the water brought [through an intermediary]? Thus Rashi explains, “This refers to Yishmael<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” and it was an act worthy of reward. (@ITDevek Tov@it) @p1[8]@p2<TIE>But, the bread he did not bring<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 You might ask: How does Rashi know this? Perhaps it simply was not baked yet! The answer is: Bread is the main part of the meal, as it is written (Daniel 5:1): “@hh<HEB>עבד @hbלחם@hh רב@ee<ENG>, [King Belshazzar] made a great feast.” Thus, Avraham would not have prepared the other foods if the bread had not yet been baked. @p1@p2Because Sarah began to menstruate<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 She did not actually menstruate, for she exclaimed soon afterward (v. 12): @hh<HEB>אחרי בלותי היתה לי עדנה@ee<ENG>, implying she did not have menstruation [see Rashi there]. Rather, “the way of women” returned to her. I.e., her head and limbs felt heavy, and her lower abdomen ached. Thus she feared she would menstruate and render the dough impure. Since Avraham ate all his food in ritual purity, she stopped working the dough and left—and before someone else could come, it turned to chametz. And it was Pesach, when chametz is forbidden. Alternatively, it could be that she actually began to menstruate. If so, why did she ask incredulously: @hh<HEB>אחרי בלותי היתה לי עדנה@ee<ENG>, when she was already menstruating? The answer is: She thought it [was not a regular cycle but] happened by chance. And she knew that Avraham ate all his food in ritual purity. So explained the @ITRe’m@it. You might ask: How could Avraham give them butter and milk and calf? It is mixing milk and meat! An answer is: He first gave them the milk, and afterward the meat. Alternatively, [he first gave the meat,] and held like the @ITHalochos Gedolos,@it [cited in Tur, Yoreh De’ah 89]: through cleaning out [the mouth by eating and drinking pareve items,] one is then permitted to eat cheese. @p1@p2As each one was prepared he immediately brought it to them.@p3 [How does Rashi know this? Because it answers the question:] If there were three tongues, why does the verse imply he brought only one, by writing “the calf,” in singular form? (@ITR. Meir Stern@it) [Alternatively,] Rashi is answering the question: Butter and milk were not mentioned before, so should it not say first, “He took the calf,” and then, additionally, he took “Butter and milk”? Thus Rashi explains, “As each one was prepared<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Since the butter and milk were ready before the calf was prepared, [he brought them first]. A further answer: Rashi learned it from the apparently extra phrase, “He had prepared, which implies that whatever he prepared first, he brought immediately. @p1@p2From this that a person should not act differently<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 You might ask: How does Rashi know this? Since angels do not eat, perhaps it is written they “ate” in order to appear as [human] guests, rather than as angels! The answer is: If so, “And they ate” teaches us nothing. It need not be written, as it is obvious that they did not really eat. And what does it even matter if they ate or appeared to eat? Thus Rashi explains, “We learn from this<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1[9]@p2<TIE>You must explain the dotted<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 You might object: Let Scripture dot only the @hh<HEB>ל@ee<ENG>, thus the undotted letters will be more, and we will expound the undotted letters — [thereby producing the same meaning, but more simply. An answer is:] It seems that we always expound the undotted before explaining the dotted. Thus if the @hh<HEB>ל@ee<ENG> alone was dotted, the verse would not indicate whom the angels asked first. They might first have asked Sarah about Avraham, or vice versa, for it is like it was written @hh<HEB>איו איה@ee<ENG> (“Where is he? Where is she?”). On the contrary, the verse would imply that they first asked Sarah about Avraham! For [we would say that] the reason only the @hh<HEB>ל@ee<ENG> is dotted is [to teach that] we should explain @hh<HEB>איו@ee<ENG> first, [before @hh<HEB>איה@ee<ENG>]. But now that @hh<HEB>איו@ee<ENG> is dotted, we first explain the undotted @hh<HEB>איה@ee<ENG> that is written in the verse. Therefore, they first asked Avraham: “Where is Sarah, your wife?” and then they asked Sarah, “Where is Avraham?” You might object: What difference does it make [whom they asked first]? The answer is: It teaches us proper conduct. First one should ask the man about his wife, and then, the woman about her husband. @ITR. Shmuel El Mashonino@it wrote: The correct answer [to “Let it dot only the @hh<HEB>ל@ee<ENG>”] is: The Torah itself is composed of undotted letters. When the undotted letters [of a dotted word] are more, and thus are explained, then the meaning of those undotted letters must fit in with the other words in the verse, since everything is undotted. And this would not be true here, [if only the @hh<HEB>ל@ee<ENG> was dotted]. This is because @hh<HEB>איו@ee<ENG> is masculine form, and does not fit in with “Sarah your wife.” (He proved this from Bamidbar 9:10: @hh<HEB>או בדרך רחוקה@ee<ENG>, where the @hh<HEB>ה@ee<ENG> is dotted; see his explanation there.) But when @hh<HEB>איו@ee<ENG> is dotted, and thus explained [since it is more than the @hh<HEB>ל@ee<ENG>], we need not worry about [it fitting in with] the rest of the verse. For in this case, @hh<HEB>איו@ee<ENG> is extracted [and explained] on its own. This is because the dotted letters, and [the verse’s] undotted letters, are both interchangeable. Furthermore, @hh<HEB>איו@ee<ENG> is dotted because the dots always come to remove letters. Only @hh<HEB>ל@ee<ENG> remains, so we add it to [the following word] @hh<HEB>איה@ee<ENG>, producing @hh<HEB>אליה@ee<ENG>, “to her”. This teaches that the angels also asked to her, about Avraham. Otherwise, where do we find that the angels asked Sarah about Avraham? Perhaps they asked someone else who was home where he was. That is why @hh<HEB>איו@ee<ENG> is dotted, [rather than the @hh<HEB>ל@ee<ENG>]. So I found written in the manuscript of my father and teacher @hh<HEB>ז''ל@ee<ENG>. This also answers a question I have heard people ask: How did Rashi know that they asked Sarah about Avraham? Perhaps they asked someone else! The @ITRe’m@it writes: Although a man should not inquire about a woman’s welfare, the Gemara already answered that this applies only when speaking directly to the woman. But a man may ask a woman’s husband about her. See explanation there. The @ITGur Aryeh@it writes: One might ask: When did the angels ask Sarah, “Where is Avraham?” They saw Avraham first, and he brought them into his home! The answer is: It was when Avraham ran to the cattle and was busy preparing the meal. @p1@p2In order to send to her the cup of blessing@p3. After they ate they recited @ITbirkas hamazon@it over a cup of wine. Sarah was not with them, and Avraham did not wish to send the cup to her, because she began to menstruate and would impart impurity to the cup with the wine. He did not want to reveal that she had begun to menstruate, so he did not pour the wine into a different cup to send to her. Alternatively, [he did not use a different cup because] the primary mitzvah is to drink from the same cup that was blessed over. Accordingly, when Avraham answered, “Here, in the tent,” he was hinting to the angels that she had begun to menstruate and thus was dwelling alone, as menstruating women do.<QC>
@p1@p2She is modest.@p3 This relates back to what Rashi explained above: “They inquired to make known her modesty.” In other words, they asked Avraham where Sarah was so that he would answer, “Here, in the tent” — and he would see that she was modest. Rashi means: to make her modesty known to Avraham. @p1[10]@p2<TIE>This was on Pesach<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 You might ask: How does Rashi know it was Pesach? The answer is: Yitzchak was born [exactly] one year later. And it is written (Shemos 12:41): “It was at the end of the 430 years, and on @ITthat very day@it, all of Adonoy’s multitudes went out<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” The 400 years began with the birth of Yitzchak, from which time Avraham had progeny [who sojourned in foreign lands]. The 400 years began and ended on the same date, and on the very day the 400 years ended, the Israelites left Egypt, as Rashi explains there. They left on the fifteenth of Nisan, the first day of Pesach. Therefore, the angel’s foretelling of Yitzchak’s birth — as well as the actual birth — were on Pesach. A further answer: Rashi learned it from what is written about Lot (19:3), “And he baked matzos,” indicating it was Pesach. And this was the same day that the angel foretold Yitzchok’s birth [to Avraham]. @p1@p2Since it is not read @HB<HEB>כְעת@ee@BO<ENG> but, rather, @HB<HEB>כָעת@ee@BO<ENG>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo It has a @hh<HEB>קמץ@ee<ENG>, not a @hh<HEB>שוא@ee<ENG>. For @hh<HEB>כְעת@ee<ENG> would connect it to @hh<HEB>חיה@ee<ENG>. [But since it says @hh<HEB>כָעת@ee<ENG>,] no time is specified later. Perforce, @hh<HEB>כָעת@ee<ENG> is like @hh<HEB>בָעת@ee<ENG>, meaning: “at this time.” [I.e., the word “this” is added.] And @hh<HEB>חיה@ee<ENG> stands separately, as Rashi goes on to explain: “When there will be life to you.” But@IT R. Meir Stern@it writes: It seems to me that @hh<HEB>כָעת@ee<ENG> denotes a time that is hinted to, as it is here, since the angel scratched a mark on the wall [to mark the time for the next year, see Rashi on 21:2]. This is because @hh<HEB>כָעת@ee<ENG> is like writing @hh<HEB>כְהָעת@ee<ENG>. But @hh<HEB>כְעת@ee<ENG> does not indicate which time. (@ITR. Meir Stern@it) @p1@p2He was speaking to him as God’s agent<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 You might ask: How does Rashi know this? This does not seem to be a question at all, as it means as follows: The angel never said that @IThe@it will return to Avraham. Rather, he was speaking as Hashem’s agent, saying that @ITHashem@it will return. This is as it says later (v. 14): “At the appointed time, I [Adonoy] will return to you.” Although the angel said, “I will return,” as if speaking about himself, it is the way of an agent to speak in the name of the party he represents, as in (Shemos 18:6): “I, your father-in-law, Yisro<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (This example is according to the view that Yisro sent an agent; see Rashi there.) And Rashi inferred this to be so, [that it is Hashem who will return,] because otherwise, why would the angel take the credit for himself [and say,] “@ITI@it will surely return”? We see later that the angels were punished for doing such a thing, when they said (19:13): “@ITWe@it are going to destroy.” [See Rashi on 19:22.] Perforce, the angel was speaking as Hashem’s agent. (@ITR. Meir Stern@it) A further answer: [The angel would not promise to return, as] Hashem might send him on another mission. He will then not be free to return with Hashem, and thus will have spoken falsely. Perforce, he spoke as Hashem’s agent. This explains why Rashi explains @hh<HEB>כעת@ee<ENG> before @hh<HEB>שוב אשוב@ee<ENG>, which does not follow the order of the verse: [for @hh<HEB>כעת@ee<ENG> denotes a set time, thus the angel must have said @hh<HEB>שוב אשוב@ee<ENG> as Hashem’s agent.] @p1@p2The entrance was behind the angel@p3. You might ask: How does Rashi know this? Perhaps it means the opposite: [the angel was behind the entrance]. The answer is: If so, [that @hh<HEB>והוא@ee<ENG> refers to the angel], the verse would have to say: “He was @ITin front@it of it.” Then it would convey that the angel was not inside the tent but in front of its entrance, where in fact he was, as Avraham was sitting at the entrance when the angel spoke with him. For if @hh<HEB>אחריו@ee<ENG> referred to the entrance, it would come out that @hh<HEB>הוא@ee<ENG> — the angel — was behind the entrance, inside the tent. (@ITR. Meir Stern@it) @p1[11]@p2<TIE>Ceased from her@p3. You might object: Rashi explained on v. 8 that she began to menstruate that day, and the dough became impure. Doesn’t this indicate that she now had the “way of women”? [The answer is:] She seems to have thought it happened by chance, not as a regular cycle. Thus she asked: @hh<HEB>היתה לי עדנה@ee<ENG>? (v. 12). She meant: “I am in doubt about the blood I saw. Is it my regular cycle, or a chance occurrence caused by my hurrying to knead the dough?” For Avraham had said (v. 6): “Hurry! Three measures of flour<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” This is preferable to @ITRe’m’s@it explanation — on v. 13 — that Sarah was saying, “My regular cycle has indeed returned, although I was worn out. But Avraham is an old man.” The @ITMaharshal@it writes: Hashem set her childbirth to be one year later, to give her three months to establish a regular period, as she had ceased seeing blood and now returned to her youth, and then nine months for pregnancy. However, it says in Rosh Hashanah 11a that Sarah conceived on Rosh Hashanah, which implies that she gave birth in the seventh month of pregnancy. This calls for further thought. @p1[14]@p2<TIE>Is there anything beyond and separated and hidden from Me<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi avoided explaining @hh<HEB>היפלא@ee<ENG> as “surprise and wonder,” in which case the verse would mean: “Should we be surprised that Hashem can do a novel thing?” That would not be in accord with Targum Onkelos who explains it as, “Is it hidden?” Yet, there is a question on Targum Onkelos: How to understand Hashem’s response “Is it hidden?” to Sarah’s laughing? She said, “My master is an old man,” conveying that it is impossible that she should give birth. Thus Hashem’s response should have been: “Is anything too difficult for Hashem?” or, “Is God’s hand unable?” But this response is understandable if @hh<HEB>היפלא@ee<ENG> means, “Should we be surprised<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.?” [However, Onkelos’s explanation is difficult]. Therefore, Rashi explains @hh<HEB>היפלא@ee<ENG> as “Is it hidden?” and nonetheless, Hashem’s response to Sarah is understandable. She said that it is impossible. And He responded: “Is there anything beyond and apart and hidden from Me, which might prevent Me from doing My will?” Rashi means that something which is hidden from a person is “separated” from him, i.e., he cannot do it when he wants to. For if he can do it when he wants, then he can declare, “I know that it will be,” [for it is not separated from him]. And why did Rashi not choose the explanation of “surprise and wonder”? Because then it should say @hh<HEB>היפלא @hbעל@hh ה'@ee<ENG>, as it is the proper usage to say that when one is surprised “over” something. Furthermore, Sarah did not express surprise; rather, she decided that it is impossible. And the response of, “Should we be surprised<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>?” would not be appropriate. (@ITR. Meir Stern@it)<QC>
@p1[16]@p2<TIE>To escort them@p3. Rashi explained this so we will not mistakenly think that @hh<HEB>לשלחם@ee<ENG> is similar to @hh<HEB>בשלח פרעה@ee<ENG> (Shemos 13:17), which means he sent them out of his domain. [Rashi knows this] because otherwise this verse would be out of sequence. It is already written @hh<HEB>ויקומו משם האנשים@ee<ENG>, how could it then say that Avraham sent them out? A further difficulty: They were not under Avraham’s control [so that he could send them out. On the contrary,] he implored them: “Please do not bypass<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Thus Rashi explains, “To escort<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (@ITR. Meir Stern@it) @p1@p2He thought that they were travelers@p3. You might ask: Even without @hh<HEB>לשלחם@ee<ENG>, would we not know that Avraham thought they were travelers? He prepared a meal for them to eat, and water to wash [their feet]! The answer is: Once they foretold [Sarah’s childbirth], and healed him, we might think he realized they were angels. Thus Rashi says he [still] thought they were travelers. (@ITRe’m@it)<QC>
@p1[17]@p2<TIE>I renamed him Avraham, a father of a multitude of nations<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 With only the first explanation, we could say: Whatever is there is his. And whatever is not there [anymore] was never his. Thus Rashi explains: “I renamed him<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” And with only this [second] explanation, we could say: whatever is in his land is his, but these four cities are not his. That is why both explanations are needed. (@ITMaharshal@it)<QC>
@p1[21]@p2<TIE>As a lesson to judges not to rule on capital punishment unless they see it<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi does not mean that it is learned from @hh<HEB>ואראה@ee<ENG>; rather, from@hh<HEB>ארדה @ee<ENG>. It is like a person descending from his seat, to go and see a matter and to investigate it. Otherwise, why does Rashi then say: @hh<HEB>דבר אחר @hbארדה נא@hh לסוף מעשיהם@ee<ENG>? If Rashi is explaining @hh<HEB>ואראה@ee<ENG>, would he say @hh<HEB>דבר אחר ארדה נא@ee<ENG>? Furthermore, should he not have written his explanation about the judges on @hh<HEB>ואראה@ee<ENG>, not on @hh<HEB>ארדה נא@ee<ENG>? Both explanations are needed. The difficulty with the first is: Hashem did not yet judge them. His descending was to see whether they sinned. Thus Rashi brings the second explanation. The difficulty with the second is: It should say @hh<HEB>אראה נא וארדה@ee<ENG>. That is why the first explanation is also needed. (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1@p2Of the country (@HB<HEB>מדינה@ee@BO<ENG>). @boRashi is answering the question: Scripture should have written @hh<HEB>הכצעקת@hb@hhם@ee<ENG>, as it is written before, @hh<HEB>וחטאת@hbם@ee<ENG>? Why then is it written in the feminine form? @p1@p2And if they @BImaintain@BO their rebelliousness<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Otherwise, what is the meaning of @hh<HEB>עשו@ee<ENG>, i.e., whether they had sinned? Scripture had already written, @hh<HEB>וחטאתם כי כבדה מאוד@ee<ENG>, indicating that indeed they had sinned.<QC>
@p1@p2Our Sages explained: The cry of a certain maiden<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. with a horrible death.@p3 They stripped her bare and smeared her with honey, and the bees stung her to death. You might ask: How did Rashi know she was a maiden? The answer is: From a @ITgezeirah shavah@it to (Devarim 22:24): “@hh<HEB>על דבר אשר לא @hbצעקה@hh בעיר@ee<ENG>, which speaks of a betrothed maiden. There is a question on the first explanation: How could Hashem be unsure of the facts, not to know whether it was indicative of their conduct so that they should be destroyed? Thus Rashi explains, “The cry of a certain maiden,” [according to which the verse means:] If they killed her unjustly, as she claimed [when she cried out, then they will be destroyed]. And even if they killed her justly, “I will know” what to do [as to punishing them for their other sins]. But the actual deed was well known to Hashem. (@ITMaharshal@it)<QC>
@p1[22]@p2<TIE>It is an emendation of the Scribes.@p3 This does not mean that the Scribes changed even one letter of what was written in the Torah, far be it. Rather, “emendation of the Scribes” denotes that they scrutinized each of those verses, and found that according to its context, its primary meaning cannot be as written in the text, but the verse bears a different meaning. Thus it should not have written, “Avraham was still standing,” but, “God was still standing” — except that Scripture changed the wording [out of respect]. It is called “emendation of the Scribes” only because they scrutinized it and commented that Scripture changed the wording. (@ITRashba@it) @p1[23]@p2<TIE>Yehudah approached him@p3. Many find difficulty with this proof, since Rashi himself explains later (44:18) that Yehudah in fact spoke sternly to Yosef. In truth, it is a scribe’s error. The text should read: “The children of Yehudah approached,” a verse that is in Yehoshua (14:6). @p1[24]@p2<TIE>Ten righteous for each city<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 This is because they are merely individuals until there are ten, when they are called a “congregation.”<QC>
@p1@p2And if You will respond that the righteous will not save<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi says this because the verses seem to contradict one other. First Avraham says, “Would You<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. not bear with the place?” implying he is praying also for the wicked. Then he says, “It would be sacrilege<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. to kill the righteous with the wicked” implying he is praying for the righteous only. Thus Rashi explains that it means, “And if You will respond that the righteous will not save the wicked<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1[25]@p2<TIE>This is what you did to the Flood generation, and to the Dispersion generation. [@p3You might ask:] Noach and his sons survived the Flood. Furthermore, He did not kill the Dispersion generation [at all]; rather, He only dispersed them. Why then would people say His craft is to destroy the righteous with the wicked? The answer is: People would say there were more people who were righteous at the time of the Flood, but He swept them away and saved only Noach and his sons in order to preserve mankind. Otherwise He would have swept away even them. And when He does not sweep away everything, because He is angry only with a certain region, He destroys the whole region, righteous and wicked alike. And so it surely was with the Dispersion generation. But the @ITRe’m@it, [commenting not on the above, but on Rashi,] objects: If so, Hashem could have responded to Avraham: Since they claim this even though it is not true, then even if I do not kill the righteous along with the wicked [but kill only the wicked] they still will say it is My craft to destroy everything! Therefore, @ITRe’m@it explains: The first @hh<HEB>חלילה לך@ee<ENG> relates to the previous verse. [I.e.,] it would be sacrilege not to save the whole place in merit of the righteous that are in it. For people will say, “It is His craft to destroy everything, the righteous with the wicked,” since they do not know that those [destroyed] were wicked. They will think that [some of] the righteous were destroyed with them. Next, Rashi sets into place, “To kill the righteous with the wicked.” This phrase is not connected to what came before, in which Avraham argued that the righteous should save the whole place. Rather, Rashi now adds: “And if You will respond<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” This relates to the second @hh<HEB>חלילה לך@ee<ENG>, where Avraham argues on behalf of the righteous alone: If the righteous cannot save the wicked, and You wish to bring a general destruction upon the place, it will be sacrilege: “Shall the Judge of all the earth not do justice [and save the righteous]?” Later, after having set these phrases into place, Rashi went back to explain the meaning of @hh<HEB>חלילה@ee<ENG>. So wrote the @ITRe’m@it. But what I wrote above is also a partial answer to his objections. @p1@p2Neither this nor anything like it@p3. Rashi is answering the question: Simply speaking, @hb<HEB>כ@ee@hhדבר הזה@ee<ENG> means that Avraham was praying only that Hashem should not do a similar act again — but was not praying for the people of Sedom [to be saved]. If so, why did he say: “Suppose there are 50 righteous people<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” showing that he indeed prayed for the people of Sedom? Thus Rashi explains that @hh<HEB>כדבר הזה@ee<ENG> means: “Neither this nor anything like it,” i.e., @hh<HEB>הזה@ee<ENG> includes both present and future acts. Avraham prayed for Israel as well, that if they will sin, Hashem should not kill the righteous with the wicked. And when Rashi later says, “In the World-to-Come,” it means in future generations. @p1@p2In the World-to-Come@p3. This is as stated in @ITPerek Chelek@it (Sanhedrin 107b) that the people of Sedom have no portion in the World-to-Come. But the @ITMaharshal@it explains as follows: If such an act is done in this world, there is sacrilege to Hashem’s Name. And even in the World-toCome, where sacrilege to Hashem’s Name does not exist, no reason will yet be found why You destroyed the righteous with the wicked. @p1@p2Can it be that He who is Judge should fail to do true justice?@p3 Why did Rashi need to explain this @hh<HEB>ה@ee<ENG> of incredulity, saying: “Can it be that He who is Judge<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”? Why was it not enough to simply say that the @hh<HEB>ה@ee<ENG> of @hh<HEB>השופט@ee<ENG> is one of incredulity? It is because Rashi wished to tell us that the @hh<HEB>ה@ee<ENG> — although it is in the word @hh<HEB>השופט@ee<ENG> — expresses incredulity regarding @hh<HEB>לא יעשה משפט@ee<ENG>.<QC>
@p1[29]@p2<TIE>And, thereby, four cities will be saved<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 @ITMahari Kolan@it writes (ch. 152): Avraham prayed that if one city has fifty righteous people, then the place should be saved — i.e., all five cities. And surely, if there will be [ten] in each city. Hashem consented, and added (v. 26): “I will bear with the @ITentire@it place,” i.e., even the villages. That is why it says @hh<HEB>עיר@ee<ENG>, and then @hh<HEB>מקום@ee<ENG>, then @hh<HEB>לכל המקום@ee<ENG>. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1[31]@p2<TIE>“I was willing,” as in: “And Moshe was willing.”@p3 We need not ask: Why did Rashi not explain this on the first @hh<HEB>הואלתי@ee<ENG> (v. 27)? The answer is: It would contradict his commentary on @hh<HEB>הואיל משה@ee<ENG> (Devarim 1:5), where Rashi says: “He began, just as, ‘Here I have begun (@hh<HEB>הואלתי@ee<ENG>)’ (Bereishis 18:27).” We see that @hh<HEB>הואלתי@ee<ENG> means, “I have begun.” Thus the first @hh<HEB>הואלתי@ee<ENG> means “I have begun,” as Rashi explained there, while only the second @hh<HEB>הואלתי@ee<ENG> means “I was willing.” @p1[32]@p2<TIE>He had already asked but could not find@p3. [Rashi means] that when Avraham mentioned fifty, he prayed also for nine including Hashem, as it says (v. 28): “But suppose they lack five of the fifty righteous?” Thus, Avraham did not need to ask again. Surely, Hashem would not destroy a city if He would find there nine righteous; however, He did not actually find. The words “but could not find” are Rashi’s comment, saying that since in fact, Hashem did not save even one city, it must be that Hashem “could not find.” Some ask: Why did Rashi say that fifty righteous people are for five cities, forty for four cities, and so forth? What brought him to this forced explanation? Perhaps Avraham was always praying for all five cities. At first he prayed by mentioning fifty, to give a complete number of ten for each city, and then he decreased the number by as much as he could, but always with the intent of saving all [the cities] everything, as Ramban writes: “I do not know what forced Rashi to say this.<TIE>.<TIE>.” It seems the answer is: Rashi deduced his explanation based on the verses’ changing expressions, as sometimes it is written @hh<HEB>לא אעשה@ee<ENG> and sometimes @hh<HEB>לא אשחית@ee<ENG>. Accordingly, when Avraham first prays for the five cities by mentioning forty-five, which includes Hashem, it is written @hh<HEB>לא אשחית@ee<ENG>. I.e., I will not destroy them altogether, but I will make them suffer because [they have ten righteous per city] only by counting Hashem. When he then prays for four cities by mentioning forty, which does not include Hashem, it is written @hh<HEB>לא אעשה@ee<ENG>. I.e., I will not do anything at all, not even make them suffer. Similarly when mentioning thirty, it is written @hh<HEB>לא אעשה@ee<ENG>, since it is without including Hashem. Then when he prays by mentioning twenty and ten, it is written @hh<HEB>לא אשחית@ee<ENG>regarding them both. I.e., I will make them suffer [because the majority of the five cities are without ten righteous in them]. Thus we see that first he prayed for all the cities, then for four, three, two, and then for one. @p1[33]@p2<TIE>Once the Judge leaves, the defender leaves<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., the verse comes to teach us that Hashem seeks out the defender’s words because He does not desire death for the wicked. But when the defender fell silent, He left. Otherwise, why does it say here, “He departed,” unlike all other prophecies where this is not mentioned? @p1[1]@p2<TIE>Elsewhere they are called men.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: By calling them angels, the verse implies that they [appeared as angels and] wore angels’ garments. But this cannot be; why then would Lot bake matzos [for them]? Perforce, they appeared to him as men. Thus Rashi explains, “Elsewhere they are called men<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” I.e., they are merely @ITcalled@it so, not that they [now] divested themselves of physicality. Regarding Avraham they were called men, out of respect for the Divine Presence. But with Lot, the Divine Presence was not there — so they are called angels. @p1@p2When the Divine Presence was with them they are called men<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 There is a difficulty with this explanation: It is obvious that angels have no importance relative to the Divine Presence. [Why does the verse switch terms to teach this?] Thus Rashi offers “another explanation.” And there is a difficulty with that as well: Why not call them men everywhere? And if you object that we would not know they were angels, so call them angels [everywhere]! And if [the term is switched] to teach that angels were common [to Avraham but not to Lot], do we not already know that Avraham was a greater tzaddik than Lot? Therefore, we need the first explanation too. (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1@p2They appointed him to be their judge@p3. You might ask: How does Rashi know that he was a judge? The answer is: It is written he was “sitting at the gate,” and “the gate” is usually the place of judgment, as we find with Boaz (Ruth 4:1). Furthermore, it is written later @hh<HEB>וישפט שפוט@ee<ENG> (v. 9), implying he was a judge.<QC>
@p1@p2He had learned from the house of Avraham to seek out travelers@p3. It cannot be because he was [generally] careful about mitzvah performance, as he was not careful about idolatry: he had them lodge before they washed (see Rashi 18:4). @p1[2]@p2<TIE>Behold, you are now my masters since you have passed by me.@p3 According to this explanation, [@hh<HEB>נא@ee<ENG> means]: “Now” that you have passed by me, you are my masters. @p1@p2Turn off the main road<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 According to this explanation, [@hh<HEB>נא@ee<ENG> means]: “Please” turn in. Otherwise, why did he say to them @hh<HEB>סורו נא@ee<ENG>? He should have simply said, “Come to the home of your servant.” @p1[3]@p2<TIE>It was Pesach@p3. Why, concerning Avraham, does it say (18:6), “Knead it and make @ITrolls@it,” rather than matzos? It was Pesach, so it should have said “@ITmatzah@it rolls”! The answer is: Avraham ordered rich matzos to be made, [e.g. kneaded with oil and honey,] in honor of the guests.<QC>
@p1[4]@p2<TIE>The people of the city, who were evil people, surrounded the house<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is saying that “Sedomites” is used as a term for evil people, as the people of Sedom were [exceptionally] evil. @p1@p2There was not one who protested<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is saying: Surely it is impossible that the small area around Lot’s house held all the people of the city! Perforce it means none of the people of the city objected, and thus it is considered as if they themselves did it. @p1[5]@p2<TIE>For the purpose of homosexuality<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 You might ask: How does Rashi know this? The answer is: It says afterward, “Behold! I have two daughters<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” This implies that from the beginning they sought something similar, i.e., homosexual relations.<QC>
@p1[8]@p2<TIE>Since they have come@p3. Otherwise, the verse would mean they came to Lot so no one would harm them. But this cannot be, as the Sedomites were not previously harassing them. (@ITGur Aryeh@it) @p1[9]@p2<TIE>Back away<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 @hh<HEB>גש@ee<ENG> means to draw close to them, while @hh<HEB>הלאה@ee<ENG> means to move away from them. Thus Rashi explains it as @hh<HEB>קרב להלאה@ee<ENG>, meaning: go away from us and thereby draw close to where you are going.<QC>
@p1@p2You are the only stranger among us.@p3 “The only,” as it is written @hh<HEB>האחד@ee<ENG>. “Stranger,” as it is written @hh<HEB>בא לגור@ee<ENG>, which denotes a stranger. @p1@p2And you have become our chastiser@p3. As it is written, @hh<HEB>וישפוט שפוט@ee<ENG>. It cannot mean actual judgment, because there is no prosecution and defense here.<QC>
@p1[12]@p2<TIE>If you have a son-in-law or sons and daughters<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 “Who else do you have here” implies they did not know. Whereas “a son-inlaw, @ITyour@it sons, @ITyour@it daughters” implies they did know. Thus Rashi explains, “@ITIf@it you have<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1@p2Your married daughter’s sons@p3. You might ask: How does Rashi know this? Perhaps they were his sons and not his grandsons! The answer is: Since it is written “son-in-law” first, followed by “your sons, your daughters,” it implies that “your sons, your daughters” refers back to “son-inlaw,” i.e., the married daughter’s sons. @p1@p2He was justifying them@p3. Although Rashi explained (v. 4) that Lot said the majority of them are wicked, at first he told the angels so, but when he saw they wished to destroy the city, he justified the people. (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1[14]@p2<TIE>Those to whom the ones at home were betrothed.@p3 But we cannot say that @hh<HEB>חתניו@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>לוקחי בנותיו@ee<ENG> are one and the same, for if they were his sons-in-law, it is obvious that they married his daughters. Why would it need to write this?<QC>
@p1[16]@p2<TIE>To salvage his possessions@p3. This is as Rashi explains on the next verse, regarding “Escape for your @ITlife@it.” @p1[17]@p2<TIE>You participated in their evil ways@p3. You might ask: It said in v. 15, “Lest you be swept away in the iniquity of the city.” Does this not imply that he did not participate in their evil ways [and was in danger only due to @ITtheir@it sins]? This is not a question, as v. 15 means: If you remain in the city you might be swept away with them [regardless of your virtue or lack of It]. Avraham’s merit will not help you then — for a tzaddik’s merit would not save even his own life! As Rashi says on 18:32, Avraham did not pray to save the city if there were less than ten tzaddikim; consequently the few would be swept away with the city if they remain. But Rashi’s comment here, “Only for the sake of Avraham are you saved,” means: [Although you participated in their evil ways,] you will be treated as if you did not do evil and are not deserving of punishment. Thus, if you leave the city you will be saved. But if you stay, you might be swept away with their iniquity — and Avraham’s merit will not help! Furthermore, Rashi’s comment of “You are not worthy to see their punishment” answers the question: Lot might be swept away with the city if he remains because he is not worthy to see their punishment, as indeed happened to his wife. (@ITR. Meir Stern@it) @p1@p2And only for the sake of Avraham are you saved@p3. People ask: It says, “Elohim remembered Avraham and He sent Lot out of the upheaval” (v. 29). On this, Rashi comments that Elohim remembered what Lot did for Avraham. Although Lot knew Sarah was Avraham’s wife, Lot did not betray Avraham in Egypt [by telling Pharaoh about Avraham]. Accordingly, why does Rashi not say here that Lot was saved because of his own merit? Furthermore, [if he had such a merit,] why did the angel warn him not to look back? The answer is: Lot indeed saved Avraham from death by not revealing who Sarah was, and, measure for measure, he was saved from death. But this act was meritorious enough to save Lot only because Avraham’s merit was so great. Lot would not have been saved had he done this kindness for someone less righteous than Avraham. Thus, the merit of Lot’s act actually depended on Avraham’s merit. This is why it says, “Elohim remembered @ITAvraham@it” (v. 29), when it should say, “Elohim remembered @ITLot@it,” according to [the initial understanding of] Rashi’s above-mentioned comment on that verse. Perforce, it is as we explained. (@ITR. Meir Stern@it)<QC>
@p1[18]@p2<TIE>Our Sages said that this Name is holy.@p3 In light of this we must understand Rashi’s next comments: @hh<HEB>אַל נָא אל תאמרו אלי וכו', נָא לשון בקשה@ee<ENG>. Rashi is saying that this verse is split delicately into two parts. Lot says to the angels [only one word]: @hh<HEB>אַל@ee<ENG>. By this, Lot conveys: “Do not tell me to flee to the mountain.” Then begins his prayer to Hashem: @hh<HEB>נָא ה', הנה מצא עבדך@ee<ENG>. And this is what Rashi means by, “@hh<HEB>נָא@ee<ENG>. It has the meaning of making a request.” In other words, Lot’s request to Hashem begins with the word @hh<HEB>נָא@ee<ENG>, as Rashi said before: “The Targum also translates it @hh<HEB>בבעו כען ה'@ee<ENG>.” I.e., @hh<HEB>בבעו@ee<ENG> is the translation of @hh<HEB>נָא@ee<ENG>, and expresses a request. This is why Rashi first explains that this Name is holy, and only then explains @hh<HEB>אַל נָא@ee<ENG>, contrary to the verse’s order. Rashi is telling us that since our Sages said this Name is holy, we must separate @hh<HEB>אַל@ee<ENG> from @hh<HEB>נָא@ee<ENG>. And @hh<HEB>אַל@ee<ENG> means: “[O angels,] do not tell me to flee to the mountain,” while @hh<HEB>נָא@ee<ENG> begins Lot’s prayer to Hashem. (@ITR. Meir Stern@it)<QC>
@p1[19]@p2<TIE>And I appeared as a righteous person and worthy of rescue.@p3 [You might ask: Does this not contradict what] Rashi explained before, that Lot too participated in the evil ways of Sedom and was saved only in Avraham’s merit? The answer is: [What Rashi said before] is the truth. But Lot mistakenly thought he was saved in his own merit. Accordingly, when Rashi explains on v. 21: “I will spare the entire city for your sake,” it does not mean, “In your @ITmerit@it.” Rather it means, “In order that you will be saved.” Nonetheless, everything that is happening is in Avraham’s merit. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) But this is difficult: How could Lot make such a mistake after hearing the angel say, “Do not look back,” implying, “You did evil and are saved only in Avraham’s merit”? The answer is: Lot was not saying [that he appeared as a righteous person] to explain why he was being saved from Sedom’s upheaval. He was speaking generally about his residence in Sedom, during which time he was saved from punishment for his deeds because he was considered to be righteous when compared to them. (@ITR. Meir Stern@it)<QC>
@p1[20]@p2<TIE>Thus, from the generation of the Dispersion till this point, there are 52 years@p3. You might ask: How does Rashi know that the other places [besides Zoar] were settled 52 years earlier? Perhaps people did not [start to] build for many years subsequent to the Dispersion. (@ITMinchas Yehudah@it) This is not a question, as Rashi already said: “How recent is its settlement? From the generation of the Dispersion, when humanity dispersed and began to settle, each in his place<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. From then till now were 52 years.” Here, Rashi is explaining his proof: As soon as the people dispersed they began to build and settle in the various places. The reasoning is as follows. Originally, they sought to build a city and tower where they could settle. When they were dispersed over the face of the earth and stopped building the tower, each built in his own place and settled there. However, @hh<HEB>נא@ee<ENG> having the numerical value of 51 is no proof, as it is not the verse’s primary meaning. It is a mere allusion that supports the point as indicated from Rashi’s text here, and from the comments of Rashi and Tosafos in Shabbos 10b. And the Ein Yaakov writes there: “So explains Rashi on the Torah.” This refutes the @ITMinchas Yehudah@it. (@ITR. Meir Stern@it)<QC>
@p1@p2Is it not a small city<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 The @ITRe’m@it asks: I do not know what Rashi will do with the question raised by @ITChazal@it in Shabbos 10b: “[Why did Lot need to state that it was close and small?] They could see that!” And this question is what moved @ITChazal@it to depart from the plain explanation of our verse, as explained there. This is not a question, as Rashi brings the simple explanation [only] for the end of the verse, @hh<HEB>הלא מצער הוא@ee<ENG>, not for the beginning, @hh<HEB>הנה וגו' קרובה וגו' והיא מצער@ee<ENG>. The beginning surely follows [@ITChazal’s@it] Midrashic explanation: the city was recently settled and its sins are few. Although Rashi at first explains also the end of the verse Midrashically, he then brings the simple explanation, “A small city<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. and you should not mind<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” This is because the end of the verse can bear this meaning, too. And Rashi needed to bring the simple explanation for the verse’s end, although the verse’s beginning must be understood [only] Midrashically, because he is answering the question: According to the Midrashic explanation, why is @hh<HEB>מצער@ee<ENG> repeated, stating twice that its sins are few? Thus Rashi brings the simple explanation: It is a small city. (@ITR. Meir Stern@it) @p1[21]@p2<TIE>I overturn<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., we should not mistakenly explain it as, “It overturns me,” since that too is a possible meaning when one speaks about another. But that meaning is not appropriate here. (@ITR. Meir Stern@it) @p1[22]@p2<TIE>From this you can learn that one destroys and the other rescues<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 But v. 17 does not prove this. Although it is written there, “He [the one angel] said, ‘Escape for your life,’” and it is not written, “They said,” it could be that only one angel rescued, but they both overturned. @p1@p2Based on: “It is insignificant.”@p3 Rashi is saying that this verse must refer back to @hh<HEB>והיא מצער@ee<ENG>, [as only that explains the name @hh<HEB>צוער@ee<ENG>]. This verse does not refer to what immediately precedes it. @p1[24]@p2<TIE>Whenever @HB<HEB>וה'@BO<ENG> appears in Scripture, it represents Him and His Heavenly Court.@p3 I.e., Hashem and His Heavenly Court agreed upon the matter. You might ask: Why does the Heavenly Court [represented by the @hh<HEB>ו@ee<ENG>] come before Hashem? (@ITMinchas Yehudah@it) This is not a question, because “the Heavenly Court” is not expressly written. It is merely hinted to, by the @hh<HEB>ו@ee<ENG> of @hh<HEB>וה'@ee<ENG>. Therefore, it would be impossible to write Hashem before the Heavenly Court, all in one word. (@ITMaharshal@it) Although we might ask why did Rashi not make this comment on (18:17) @hb<HEB>וה'@hh אמר המכסה אני מאברהם@ee<ENG> and on (21:1) @hb<HEB>וה'@hh פקד את שרה@ee<ENG>, @ITRe’m@it explained each case. See there for more detail. (@ITMinchas Yehudah@it) But this is not a question, because the rule of “Whenever @hh<HEB>וה'@ee<ENG> appears in Scripture, it represents Him and His Heavenly Court” applies only when @hh<HEB>וה'@ee<ENG> has no direct connection to what preceded. [Thus it does not apply to those verses, as will be explained later]. This is because when “Hashem” is at the beginning of a phrase or matter, the verb should precede it. Here it should say @hh<HEB>וימטר ה'@ee<ENG> rather than @hh<HEB>וה' המטיר@ee<ENG>. Whereas the order [of @hh<HEB>וה' המטיר@ee<ENG>] implies it is in the middle of the matter, when it is not. Perforce, it comes to allude to Him and His Heavenly Court. But with @hh<HEB>וה' אמר המכסה אני@ee<ENG>, the @hh<HEB>ו@ee<ENG> simply means “and.” It connects to the previous point. “They [the angels] got up from there” to go destroy Sedom, and consequently, @hh<HEB>ה' אמר המכסה אני@ee<ENG>, as Rashi explained there: “I gave him this Land<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. Can I, then, destroy the children without informing the father?” Similarly is the case with @hh<HEB>וה' פקד את שרה@ee<ENG>. As Rashi explains there, “This is<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. to teach that whoever prays for another<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. will be answered first. For it said before, ‘He [Avraham] prayed,’ and right afterwards, ‘And Hashem remembered Sarah.’” But here it is not a continuation of anything previously mentioned. On the contrary, it is written, “The sun had risen, etc.” and afterwards, “[Hashem] caused it to rain, etc.” Actually, He caused it to rain before the sun came out as it states, “At the break of dawn, etc.” and Rashi explains that this is a time when both the sun and the moon rule.” (@ITMaharmash@it) @p1@p2At the advent of the morning<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is saying that “Hashem caused to rain” does not relate to the preceding verse, “The sun had risen upon the earth, when Lot came to Zoar,” [to say] that only after Lot came to Zoar did it begin to rain. Rather, it means that “Hashem caused to rain” already @ITbefore@it Lot came to Zoar, at the very advent of the morning, before the sun had even risen. @p1@p2God said: If I punish them by day<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Question: They will all be destroyed. How then will they be able to say this? The answer is: Hashem wanted to demonstrate that they did not repent [when they saw the punishment begin], although they had no excuse not to. (@ITMaharshal@it) However, this is not a question. Rashi means that the sun and moon worshipers in other places would say this, not those in Sedom who were destined for destruction. [You might object to this answer:] Rashi says, “@ITWe@it would not have been destroyed,” implying that those in Sedom are saying this about themselves. The answer is: People in other places could speak in this manner too, [identifying with them] as if they were speaking about themselves. This is similar to (Shemos 18:9) @hh<HEB>ויחד יתרו@ee<ENG>, [on which Rashi explains:] “Yisro’s flesh felt sharp stinging [as he was grieved by the destruction of Egypt].” @p1@p2It began as rain and turned into sulfur and fire@p3. Rashi is answering the question: Why is it written, “Caused to rain”? It should say, “Hurled down.” Furthermore, “Caused to rain” contradicts [what follows], as sulfur is not rain. Thus Rashi explains: “It began as rain, and turned into<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (@ITR. Meir Stern@it) @p1[26]@p2<TIE>Behind him [meaning: in back] of Lot.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Why does it not say, “Behind herself”? Perforce, it means that when she was behind Lot, she looked. The @ITMaharshal@it explains that it says “behind him” because she reasoned: since she is being saved due to Lot, she may look behind him — just not behind herself.<QC>
@p1[29]@p2<TIE>How does the remembering of Avraham affect Lot? He remembered<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi is answering the question:] Whenever it says, “Hashem remembered,” the one who needs the deliverance is remembered. For example (30:22): “Elokim remembered Rochel,” and (Shmuel I, 1:9): “Hashem remembered her [Channah].” But here, why is Avraham remembered, while Lot is delivered? Therefore Rashi explains that Hashem indeed remembered Lot, who needed the deliverance. And when it says @hh<HEB>את אברהם@ee<ENG>, it means that Hashem remembered for Lot the kindness he did “with Avraham.” Thus, @hh<HEB>את אברהם@ee<ENG> is to be understood as @hh<HEB>עם אברהם@ee<ENG> (with Avraham). (@ITR. Meir Stern@it) @p1@p2And he did not betray him because he was sympathetic towards him@p3. @ITRe’m@it asks: Why is the [greater] kindness of Lot leaving his country and birthplace to follow [i.e., accompany] Avraham wherever he went, not mentioned [instead]? It seems to me that this is no question on @ITChazal’s@it statement [that Hashem remembered only Lot’s kindness to Avraham in Egypt], because the answer is: When Lot went with Avraham, he did not go for Avraham’s good but for his own good. For if Avraham would die, Lot would inherit his property! As Rashi explains [that Lot’s herdsmen thought] as much, on (13:7), “There was a quarrel between the herdsmen of Avram’s flocks<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” But when Lot did not reveal who Sarah was, this was indeed considered to be for Avraham’s good. The whole reason he went with Avraham was to inherit him, so he should have told them that Sarah was Avraham’s wife, so they would kill Avraham, and he would inherit him. After all, he had set his eyes on Avraham’s money. Therefore, [because Lot did not reveal this to Pharaoh,] it was considered a [true] kindness.<QC>
@p1[33]@p2<TIE>Wine presented itself to them in the cave<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 The @ITRe’m@it asks: Why does Rashi disregard the opinion in Bereishis Rabbah (51:8) that says Lot’s daughters had wine in the cave because the people of Sedom had a lot of it, and would store it in caves? Instead, Rashi follows R. [Yehudah] bar Simon, who says that something resembling [the World to Come] was done for them, [as it says (Yoel 4:18): “And it shall come to pass on that day that the mountains shall drip with wine,”] showing that the intention of Lot’s daughters was for the sake of Heaven. But Rashi later comments that the older daughter initiated @ITzenus@it—implying that their intention was for @ITzenus@it, not for the sake of Heaven! @ITRe’m@it answers: Rashi’s opinion is that even according to the one who says their intention was for @ITzenus@it would agree that Hashem presented them with wine so that two nations might come forth from them, as Rashi explains on @hh<HEB>ותשקין@ee<ENG>.<QC>
@p1@p2To tell us that once she arose he was aware<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 You might ask: Is it not written, “He was @ITnot@it aware that she lay down or got up”? The answer is: At first he was not aware of her lying down or getting up, but when he began drinking the second night he remembered what he had done, yet he drank anyway. (@ITMaharshal@it) [Alternatively:] You might ask: Why is it written, “He was not aware that<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. she got up,” if he was aware? The answer is: Lot surely was aware she got up from his bed. But he was not aware he had relations with her. (@ITGur Aryeh@it) But this answer is difficult, for if he was aware that she got up from his bed, the original question stands: Is it not written, “He was @ITnot@it aware that she<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. got up”? Rather, it means that at the moment she got up from his bed he was not aware [immediately of her having lied down]. And the dot tells us that later he became aware of both her lying down and getting up. And so we must say, simply speaking, that when she got up he was aware of this, and consequently he became aware of her lying down as well, for one cannot get up without having lied down. And when Rashi writes that “once she arose he was aware,” this is as opposed to between the lying down and the getting up, he was not aware. (@ITR. Meir Stern@it)<QC>
@p1[36]@p2<TIE>These did it with themselves<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 @hh<HEB>שלטו@ee<ENG> means “had relations,” since @hh<HEB>לרבעה@ee<ENG> is translated by Onkelos as @hh<HEB>למשלט@ee<ENG>. In other words, they “had relations with themselves” and removed their virginity [beforehand. This enabled them to conceive]. This is the meaning of @hh<HEB>והוציאו ערותן לחוץ@ee<ENG>. Some versions of Rashi say @hh<HEB>והוציאו ע@hbד@hhותן@ee<ENG> (“they removed their evidence”), which means the same. It refers to their virginity, which are the evidence they are virgins, as it is written (Devarim 22:17) @hh<HEB>אלה @hbבתולי@hh בתי@ee<ENG>, which Targum Yonasan explains as @hh<HEB>אלה @hbעדות@hh בתי@ee<ENG>.<QC>
@p1[1]@p2<TIE>When he saw that the cities were destroyed and the travelers ceased<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 This explanation raises the question: Why did he go to Gerar, which is very distant? Therefore Rashi brings the alternate explanation. Since he wished to distance himself from Lot, he traveled to Gerar which was an inhabited place. (@ITMaharshal@it)<QC>
@p1[4]@p2<TIE>The angel prevented him<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi needed to explain this so the verses do not contradict each other. It is written later (v. 6): “I also prevented you from sinning against Me,” implying that Hashem prevented him, whereas this verse implies that Avimelech refrained on his own from coming near her. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1[5]@p2<TIE>To include her servants, camel-drivers, and mule-drivers<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 @hh<HEB>גמלים וחמרים@ee<ENG> is the correct text. It refers to the men who drive the camels and donkeys, [not the animals themselves]. @p1[6]@p2<TIE>It is true that at first you had no intention of sinning<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Why is it not written, “I also know that you did this with an innocent heart @ITand clean hands@it,” as Avimelech said about himself? @p1@p2But, do not claim clean hands@p3. You might ask: After all, was Avimelech in fact not free of sin, since he did not transgress? The answer is: Hashem was saying, “Not due to yourself are you free of sin, as you say. Rather, it is due to Me. You would have lain with her even though she told you she was his wife!”<QC>
@p1[7]@p2<TIE>And do not think: perhaps she has become repugnant in his eyes<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi explains this because “Return the man’s wife, for he is a prophet” implies Avimelech should return her only because Avraham is a prophet @ITand@it Sarah is a married woman. But were he not a prophet, he would not return her although she is a married woman. How can this be? Illicit relations are forbidden to all Noach’s descendants! Therefore Rashi answers that “For he is a prophet” means: “And do not think<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”<QC>
@p1[9]@p2<TIE>A plague that is unusual to befall any beings<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., “Deeds that ought not to be done” cannot refer to Avraham, as he had not performed any deed. He only spoke.<QC>
@p1[12]@p2<TIE>In order to make his words truthful, he responded in this fashion<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., Avraham should have said, “She is my brother’s daughter,” and then he would not have needed to say, “But not the daughter of my mother.” He said as he did to make truthful what he had said earlier: “She is my sister.” You might ask: In 12:19, [Avraham was asked a similar question.] Why did Avraham not respond to Pharaoh at all? The answer is: Pharaoh had asked him only once, so he did not respond. But Avimelech asked twice, therefore he found it necessary to respond. (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1[14]@p2<TIE>So that he be mollified and pray for him.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because for taking his wife, [gifts were not necessary]. As Avimelech did not touch her, it is like he never took her. [You might ask:] Why did Avimelech need to mollify Avraham, while Pharaoh did not? The answer is: Pharaoh was completely unaware [that he had taken a married woman], because Avraham on his own craftily told Sarah (12:13): “Please say that you are my sister.” But here, @ITthey@it asked Avraham if she is his wife or his sister. He feared they would kill him and was compelled to say, “She is my sister.” That is why Pharaoh was smitten only with a disease for which relations are harmful, and after he returned her he no longer needed a cure. Whereas even after Avimelech had returned her, mollified Avraham and gave gifts, nonetheless it says: “Adonoy restrained every womb.” This was because Avimelech was considered a nearly deliberate sinner, since they interrogated Avraham: “Is she your wife?” As it says in Bava Kama 92a, “When a guest arrives in a city<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. is he asked about his wife?” [see Rashi, v. 11]. @p1[16]@p2<TIE>Avimelech said it was out of respect for her, in order to mollify her<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 This means as follows: Avimelech really gave them to Avraham so that Avraham would pray for him, as Rashi explained on v. 14. If so, why did Avimelech say to Sarah that it was to honor @ITher@it? [The answer is:] He said the opposite [of the truth] in order to mollify her. The @ITRe’m@it asks: How does Rashi know that Avimelech gave them to Avraham in order to mollify @IThim@it? Perhaps he really gave them in Sarah’s honor! The @ITRe’m@it answers: Since Hashem said, “Now return the man’s wife<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. and he will pray for you,” we learn that Avimelech’s goal [in returning Sarah] was to mollify Avraham so he would pray for him. Assumedly, Avimelech gave the gifts for the same reason. But it seems to me [that the answer is:] If Avimelech really gave for @ITher@it honor, why did he give to Avraham? According to what Avimelech said [his intentions were], he should have given them to Sarah, which would have honored her more! Perforce, the main [reason for] giving the gifts to Avraham was so Avraham would pray for him, and Avimelech said what he did to Sarah only to honor and mollify her.<QC>
@p1[18]@p2<TIE>According to Sarah’s words@p3. @hh<HEB>על דבר@ee<ENG> cannot mean “because of,” as it does in Devarim 23:5 @hb<HEB>על דבר@hh אשר לא קדמו אתכם@ee<ENG>, because [of the following difficulty:] it is written earlier (v. 6), “Also, I prevented you from sinning against Me.” This implies that Hashem deprived Avimelech alone of the ability to have relations. Yet in our verse it is written, “For Hashem had restrained @ITevery@it womb.” Perforce, in our verse @hh<HEB>על דבר@ee<ENG> means Adonoy did this “according to Sarah’s words.” And when it said (12:17) @hh<HEB>וינגע ה' את פרעה.<TIE>.<TIE>. @hbעל דבר@hh שרי@ee<ENG>, on which Rashi commented: “According to her commands,” this explanation was learned from here, based on the phrases’ similarity. (@ITauthor’s commentary@it) @p1[1]@p2<TIE>To teach you that whoever prays for mercy for another<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 You might ask: How does this prove it? Perhaps she was remembered now because this was the time Hashem set. She needed to give birth on Pesach, and she was remembered on Rosh Hashanah, so it had to be now. The answer is: Rashi himself answered this when he wrote, “He had already remembered her @ITbefore@it He cured Avimelech.” And what is the verse teaching us by saying that Hashem cured Sarah first? Perforce, “To teach you that whoever prays for mercy for another<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (@ITRe’m@it) The @ITRe’m@it objects: Rashi implies that this section is out of place, for he says, “This section was placed here to teach you<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” But this is not so, for on the fifteenth of Nisan the angel foretold to Sarah, and on the sixteenth, Sedom was overturned and Lot was rescued with his daughters. And right after the incident of Lot with his daughters, Avraham traveled to reside in Gerar, where Sarah was taken and Hashem restrained every womb of Avimelech’s house, whereupon Avraham prayed for them and they were cured. And on Rosh Hashanah, Sarah was remembered. Everything is in chronological order! He answers: @hh<HEB>וה' פקד@ee<ENG> implies He remembered her before He cured Avimelech. [Had Sarah conceived after, it would say @hh<HEB>ויפקוד ה'@ee<ENG>.] Thus, Avimelech’s curing should not have been written before. And why was it? In order “to teach you that whoever prays for mercy for another<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1@p2To Avraham@p3. Not to Sarah, as it says nowhere that Hashem spoke to her [about this]. The @ITRe’m@it asks: Why did Rashi not explain that also Hashem’s @ITsaying@it was to Avraham and not to Sarah? He answers: Perhaps because it is written there (17:19), “God said, ‘Indeed your wife Sarah will bear you a son,’” [so it is obvious] that this was said to Avraham; Rashi did not need to explain it. And Rashi did not need to explain it even for Hashem’s @ITspeaking@it, since it is written there (15:1), “The word of Adonoy came to @ITAvram@it.” Rather, Rashi comes to tell us the difference between “Hashem did for Sarah as He @IThad spoken@it,” and “At the designated time that Elokim @IThad spoken@it” (v. 2). The former refers to Avraham, while the latter refers to [His declaration of] the designated time, as Rashi explains there. You might ask: Why does Rashi explain this? The answer is: Rashi means that Hashem said only to Avraham, “That one [Yishmael] will not be your heir” (15:4), and never promised that the heir will come from Sarah. Nevertheless, “Hashem did for Sarah,” although He had spoken only to Avraham. (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1[2]@p2<TIE>The designated time that He spoke.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Why is it written @hh<HEB>אֹתו@ee<ENG>? It should be vowelized @hh<HEB>אִתו@ee<ENG>, since it was spoken to Avraham. Therefore Rashi explains that @hh<HEB>אֹתו@ee<ENG> refers to the designated time. And since it cannot be said that one “speaks” a time, Rashi needed to add the phrase “and set” so that the speaking refers to the @ITsetting@it of the designated time. @p1[7]@p2<TIE>An expression of praise and esteem<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi is saying] that the word @hh<HEB>מי@ee<ENG> is similar to the word @hh<HEB>מה@ee<ENG>, which infers greatness and honor, such as (Tehillim 31:20): “How (@hh<HEB>מה@ee<ENG>) great is Your goodness!” and (ibid. 92:6): “How (@hh<HEB>מה@ee<ENG>) great are Your works!” (@ITRe’m@it) But it seems to me that [Rashi explained as he did] because if the verse follows its plain meaning, why did Sarah ask, “Who said to Avraham?” Hashem clearly said it to him! Perforce, it is “An expression of praise<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1[8]@p2<TIE>After he was twenty-four months old@p3. [Rashi knows this because otherwise] it should have written @hh<HEB>ותגמל@ee<ENG> (she weaned him). Perforce, @hh<HEB>ויגמל@ee<ENG> means the child weaned himself. [And Rashi deduced that this happened] because he was twenty-four months old, when a child rejects his mother’s milk and stops nursing. (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1@p2Because the great people of the time were there<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 @ITRe’m@it explains that [Rashi knows this because] for a prophet [such as Avraham, unlike for a king such as Achashveirosh,] it makes no difference if his feast was great in its number of days or guests. Perforce, it means that the world’s great people were there.<QC>
@p1[9]@p2<TIE>And make sport before us<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi brings all three explanations] because if Scripture meant only one, Scripture should have stated it expressly. Perforce, the general term @hh<HEB>מצחק@ee<ENG> was used to refer to all of them. (@ITR. Meir Stern@it) @ITRe’m@it asks: When Hashem asked, “What is Yishmael now, righteous or wicked?” the angels responded: “He is righteous” (see Rashi on v. 17). But according to Rashi here, on the contrary, Yishmael was exceptionally wicked! @ITRe’m@it answers: Hashem was asking only about the particular sin for which the angels were condemning him [i.e., killing the Jews through thirst]. And similarly Yishmael was not judged as a @hh<HEB>בן סורר ומורה@ee<ENG> [who is killed for his future sins] because a @hh<HEB>בן סורר ומורה@ee<ENG> has already become involved in activities leading to his eventual death penalty, whereas Yishmael did not as yet do anything to deserve to die of thirst.<QC>
@p1[10]@p2<TIE>That he is my son even if he were not as deserving as Yitzchok<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because otherwise, why does it say @hh<HEB>עם@ee<ENG> twice? It should say: @hh<HEB>עם בני יצחק@ee<ENG>. Perforce, it means that being “my son” is reason enough to exclude Yishmael from the inheritance, as is being “Yitzchok,” each on its own. [Rashi considered this explanation] preferable to that of Targum Yonasan. (@ITR. Meir Stern@it) @p1[11]@p2<TIE>For he heard that he fell into bad ways@p3. Rashi brings both the Midrashic and the simple explanation because with the simple explanation alone, a question arises: In v. 12, Hashem tells Avraham, “Do not consider this wrong on account of the boy @ITand your slave-woman@it.” This implies that Avraham was perturbed also about his slave-woman. So why does our verse mention only “his son”? Thus Rashi explains our verse [Midrashically,] that Yishmael fell into bad ways—something not relevant to Avraham’s slave-woman. But without the simple explanation, another question arises: [Since Avraham was not perturbed about sending Yishmael away,] why does Hashem then say to Avraham in v. 12: “Do not consider this wrong<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. regarding all that Sarah tells you, listen to her<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”? What does listening to Sarah have to do with Yishmael’s fall into bad ways? Furthermore, the reason that Scripture then gives, “For only through Yitzchok will seed be considered yours,” is irrelevant to Avraham’s concern over Yishmael’s falling into bad ways. This is why Rashi needed the simple explanation as well. It seems that [Rashi learned] the two explanations from @hh<HEB>על אודות בנו@ee<ENG>, for it appears to be repetitious. Since @hh<HEB>אודות@ee<ENG> means the same as @hh<HEB>על@ee<ENG>, why say @hh<HEB>על@ee<ENG> twice? It could have simply said @hh<HEB>על בנו@ee<ENG>, as in the next verse: @hh<HEB>אל ירע .<TIE>.<TIE>. על הנער@ee<ENG>. Perforce, it comes to tell us that Avraham was perturbed about two things. But only for sending them away did Hashem say (v. 12), “Do not consider this wrong<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (@ITR. Meir Stern@it) @p1[12]@p2<TIE>To the voice of prophecy that was within her.@p3 [Note: although this phrase is absent from our version of Rashi here, it parallels an extant comment of Rashi on 16:2.] Rashi deduced this because it could have said, “Listen to her words,” as it said before, “Regarding all that Sarah tells you.” Or [it could have said] @hh<HEB>שמע אליה@ee<ENG>, as in (Devarim 11:13): @hh<HEB>והיה אם שמוע תשמעו @hbאל@hh מצותי@ee<ENG>. Furthermore, a voice without words is just a meaningless sound. How could Avraham be told to obey a mere sound? Thus Rashi explains that it means the voice of prophecy. I.e., she did not say it on her own; it was the voice of prophecy. The expression @hh<HEB>יצאה בת קול@ee<ENG> is somewhat similar to this. And for this reason, @hh<HEB>כי שמעת לקול אשתך@ee<ENG> (3:17), written concerning Adam HaRishon, is interpreted in Bereishis Rabba 19:5 to mean that she was wailing over him with her voice. (@ITR. Meir Stern@it) @p1[14]@p2<TIE>But no silver and gold because he despised him<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 But according to the simple explanation [see Rashi on v. 11] he did not fall into bad ways. Why did Avraham not give him silver and gold? An answer is: Avraham assumed that shortly, after Sarah’s anger subsides, he will bring him back. (@ITMaharshal@it) But according to @ITR. Meir Stern’s@it explanation on v. 11, the question does not arise, because the simple explanation does not conflict with the Midrash. Both are needed; see there. Furthermore, @ITMaharshal’s@it answer cannot be correct. For if it was, Rashi himself should have explained thusly, that Avraham intended to bring him back—as this would satisfy both the simple explanation and the Midrash. Rashi should not have given a reason that satisfies only the Midrash. @p1@p2He also placed the child on her shoulder<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 @hh<HEB>ואת הילד@ee<ENG> refers to what immediately preceded [@hh<HEB>שם על שכמה@ee<ENG>] rather than to @hh<HEB>ויתן אל הגר@ee<ENG>. [Rashi knows this] because if Avraham did not place the child on her shoulder, Scripture should state that she picked him up before saying, “And she threw the lad<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”<QC>
@p1@p2She returned to her family’s idolatry@p3. Rashi deduced this because @hh<HEB>ותלך@ee<ENG> connotes going along deliberately and willingly, as @hh<HEB>הליכה@ee<ENG> always means. Yet then it says @hh<HEB>ותתע@ee<ENG>, connoting that she did not know where she was going, as she lost her way in the desert. One term contradicts the other. And we cannot say that at first she knew where she was going but then lost her way, because why should Scripture tell us she went deliberately? It is obvious that she went where she was going before she lost her way! Furthermore, the verse’s intent is to recount how she lost her way in the desert and therefore had no water, etc. There is no reason to say she went deliberately on the way. Therefore Rashi explains that her @hh<HEB>ותתע@ee<ENG> was deliberate, and that is why it says @hh<HEB>ותלך ותתע@ee<ENG> — she deliberately went astray. How? She returned to her family’s idolatry. Rashi explained @hh<HEB>ותתע@ee<ENG> as idolatry, based on @hh<HEB>ויהי כאשר @hbהתעו@hh אותי@ee<ENG> (20:13), translated by Onkelos as: “When the nations went astray after idolatry.” (@ITR. Meir Stern@it) @p1[15]@p2<TIE>Because the sick drink a great deal.@p3 Rashi deduced this because it should have said,@BO@p3 The @ITbread@it and the water were used up.” For it said before, “He took bread and a skin pouch of water,” and Avraham assumedly gave them food and drink proportionally, so both should have finished together. Thus Rashi explains that Scripture is telling us that Yishmael drank disproportionately to his eating, as the sick drink a great deal, and that is why it says, “The water was used up,” but not the bread. (@ITR. Meir Stern@it) But it seems to me that Rashi knows this because it does not say, “And they had no more water to drink.” The expression “the water was used up” implies that it happened unexpectedly, ahead of time. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it)<QC>
@p1[16]@p2<TIE>From afar.@p3 Here, @hh<HEB>נגד@ee<ENG> does not follow its simple meaning (“in front of”) for if so, why would Scripture need to tell us this? But it is understandable if it means “from afar,” because the verse goes on to give a reason: “She said, ‘Let me not see the lad die.’” We find @hh<HEB>נגד@ee<ENG> meaning “in front of,” as in (Tehillim 16:8): “I have placed Hashem in front of me (@hh<HEB>לנגדי@ee<ENG>) constantly,” where it has the connotation of closeness. Yet in our verse, following @hh<HEB>נגד@ee<ENG> comes the word @hh<HEB>הרחק@ee<ENG>, meaning “distant,” one term contradicting the other. Therefore, Rashi explains that @hb<HEB>מִ@hhנגד@ee<ENG> means the opposite of @hh<HEB>נגד@ee<ENG>. It is like saying @hh<HEB>מִן נגד@ee<ENG>, the prefix @hh<HEB>מִ@ee<ENG> is like @hh<HEB>מִן@ee<ENG>. It conveys that she did not sit close, in front of the child. She sat from afar, about two bow-shots away.<QC>
@p1[17]@p2<TIE>The prayer of the sick person is more effective than the prayers of others<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Hagar also cried, as it is written (v. 16), “She wept in a loud voice.” Why did Hashem not hear her voice? [You might object:] The Gemara asks in Berachos 5b, “Why was R. Yochanan unable to heal himself [through prayer]?” and answers, “A prisoner cannot free himself from jail.” The reason must be that R. Yochanan was not able to concentrate [in prayer]. But if he were able to do so, his own prayer would be better. (@ITRe’m@it) @p1@p2He is judged according to his present deeds<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 The question this raises on @hh<HEB>בן סורר ומורה@ee<ENG>, who is killed for his future sins (Sanhedrin 71b), will be answered in Parshas Ki Teitzei (Devarim 21:18). @ITRe’m@it asks: Why did the angels not condemn him for the sins he already did, rather than for those of the future which will be done not by him but by his descendants? He answers: Perhaps this Aggadah is according to R. Shimon, who differs with R. Akiva and all those who interpret @hh<HEB>מצחק@ee<ENG> (v. 9) as speaking of [Yishmael’s] misdeeds. But to answer that the Aggados are in disagreement seems to me forced, unless we see clearly that it is so. Thus it seems the answer is: The angels could not condemn Yishmael for his present deeds because the Heavenly Court punishes only from the age of twenty, and Yishmael was just seventeen. [You might ask:] Why did they not condemn him for his present deeds, but in terms of the future [when he will be of punishable age]? The answer is: At the end of his life he repented for his present deeds, as Rashi explains on (25:9): “His sons Yitzchok and Yishmael buried him [Avraham].” @p1@p2One whose descendants will eventually kill Your children with thirst, You will provide for him a well?@p3 You might ask: Is it not written (Devarim 24:16), “Fathers shall not be put to death because of sons”? The answer is: Hashem asked the angels if Yishmael had sinned through water. Regarding water, was he righteous or wicked? They answered he was righteous regarding water but was otherwise wicked, and moreover, “His descendants will kill Your children with thirst. Will You then provide him a well?” Hashem answered: “Since now he is righteous regarding water, I will provide him the well.” (@ITMaharshal@it)<QC>
@p1[30]@p2<TIE>The feminine form for “witness”<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is explaining that @hh<HEB>לעדה@ee<ENG> means “witness” (@hh<HEB>עדות@ee<ENG>), not “congregation” (@hh<HEB>עדה@ee<ENG>). And it is written @hh<HEB>לעדה@ee<ENG> rather than @hh<HEB>לעד@ee<ENG> because @hh<HEB>עדה@ee<ENG> is the feminine form of @hh<HEB>עד@ee<ENG>. @p1@p2They agreed among themselves that whoever appears at the well<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because otherwise, how did Avraham prove it [that he dug the well]? It could not have been through actual witnesses, for if Avraham’s servants had actual witnesses, why did they not make a legal claim before Avimelech?<QC>
@p1[34]@p2<TIE>That year preceded the binding of Yitzchok by twelve years.@p3 Rashi was brought to explain this due to the following verse, “After (@hh<HEB>אחר@ee<ENG>) these events,” which [ostensibly] means right after, since @hh<HEB>אחר@ee<ENG> always implies right after—as Rashi commented earlier on 15:1. Yet the binding of Yitzchok was 12 years later, so why does it say @hh<HEB>אחר@ee<ENG>? Thus Rashi explains (on the following verse) that it means “After the words of Satan,” not after the just-mentioned events of Avraham and Avimelech.<QC>
@p1[2]@p2<TIE>@HB<HEB>נא@ee@p1@p2<ENG> is an expression of a request<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., @hh<HEB>נא@ee<ENG> mentioned here means “request” although in many places it does not mean “request.” (@ITRe’m@it) @p1@p2So that He not confuse him suddenly, and become bewildered<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., so people will not say that Hashem confused him and that is why he did it, but otherwise he would have refrained. It seems that [Rashi added the second explanation, “To endear the mitzvah to him,”] because the first explanation is insufficient on its own, as then it should say@hh<HEB>את בנך יחידך אשר אהבת@ee<ENG>. The fact that @hh<HEB>את@ee<ENG> is repeated, implies a division [of the verse into separate parts]: each time, Hashem was answering another question of Avraham’s. And the second explanation is insufficient on its own, as then the verse should be reversed [and follow its logical order]: @hh<HEB>קח את יצחק את בנך את יחידך אשר אהבת@ee<ENG>. For also [in this order, the use of many expressions would] endear the mitzvah. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1[3]@p2<TIE>Yishmael and Eliezer@p3. [Rashi knows this] because otherwise, what does “his two assistants” mean? Did Avraham have only two assistants? Perforce, it means his special assistants Yishmael and Eliezer. See Bamidbar 22:22 where I answered why Rashi explained Bilaam’s [need for] two assistants differently, [saying: “An esteemed person who travels should take along two people to serve him, and for one to serve the other.”] But the @ITMaharshal@it answered that Rashi explained that Bilaam’s assistants served one another because Bilaam was arrogant and needed service. But Avraham was humble and did not require service; he took care of himself. He took along two assistants only so he would not be alone when one of them needs to relieve himself. Thus Rashi explained here as he did. @p1@p2Onkelos translates it @HB<HEB>וצלח@ee@BO<ENG> [he split] as in @HB<HEB>וצלחו@BO<ENG> [they split]<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. @boIt seems that Rashi is not proving from Onkelos [that @hh<HEB>ויבקע@ee<ENG> means “splitting”]. Rather, he is explaining that [also Onkelos’s translation of] @hh<HEB>צלח@ee<ENG> is “splitting,” as in (Shmuel II 19:18): “They split (@hh<HEB>וצלחו@ee<ENG>) the Jordan.”<QC>
@p1[6]@p2<TIE>Because Israel eats of its reward.@p3 Rashi brought both explanations because according to the first one [“it consumes”] a question arises: Why not call it @hh<HEB>אוכלת@ee<ENG>? Thus Rashi explains, “it prepares.” But according to this [second] explanation, it should be called @hh<HEB>סכין@ee<ENG>, which is its simple meaning. Thus Rashi explains further: “Because Israel eats of its reward.” And the last explanation alone is insufficient, although it answers why it is called @hh<HEB>מאכלת@ee<ENG> and not @hh<HEB>אוכלת@ee<ENG> or @hh<HEB>סכין@ee<ENG>, because why does it say @hb<HEB>ה@hhמאכלת@ee<ENG>, connoting something already known? Until this point a knife was not called a @hh<HEB>מאכלת@ee<ENG>! Scripture calls it so only now, because of this incident. Therefore, Rashi explains that “it consumes” and “it prepares,” and therefore it is a term that is used for every knife. (@ITR. Meir Stern@it)<QC>
@p1[12]@p2<TIE>I will make a cut in him and draw a little blood<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Question: Why does drawing blood make a @hh<HEB>מום@ee<ENG> (blemish)? The answer is: Avraham said, “I will draw blood and offer it up. Hashem said: “Do not draw blood.” Avraham thought that just drawing blood was insufficient and said, “If so, I will offer up one of his limbs.” Hashem said: “Do not cause him any @hh<HEB>מום@ee<ENG>.” (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1[13]@p2<TIE>It was prepared for this purpose from the Six Days of Creation.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because it should have said @hh<HEB>וירא איל אחר נאחז@ee<ENG>. Why does it say @hh<HEB>והנה@ee<ENG>? Perforce, to teach that “it was prepared for this purpose<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”@BO @bo @p1@p2After the angel had said to him<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., @hh<HEB>אחר@ee<ENG> is connected to an earlier phrase. It is out of place. The verse means to say: “Avraham looked up @ITafterward@it, and beheld a ram that had been caught<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Rashi proves it from Onkelos, who translates: “And Avraham looked up @ITafter these@it [words].” @p1@p2For it was running towards Avraham<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because it says @hh<HEB>נאחז@ee<ENG> in singular, which must refer to the ram itself. If so, why does it say @hh<HEB>בקרניו@ee<ENG>? Rashi answers that it tells us that the ram’s face, meaning its horns, was towards Avraham, as it was running to Avraham to be sacrificed, but the Satan entangled it to impede it. Perhaps the @ITRe’m,@it too, meant this. (@ITR. Meir Stern@it)<QC>
@p1[17]@p2<TIE>One for the father and one for the son@p3. It seems to me that Rashi means that both blessings are for Yitzchok: one in his own merit and the other in Avraham’s merit. This is the meaning of “One for the father and one for the son.” (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it)<QC>
@p1[20]@p2<TIE>The words of the thoughts that came about as a result of the akeidah.@p3 The @ITRe’m@it writes: I do not know what brought Rashi to depart from the simple meaning of Scripture, that @hh<HEB>אחרי הדברים האלה@ee<ENG> refers to the words spoken previously — the angel’s words promising “I will make your descendants as numerous” — as indicated by the word @hh<HEB>האלה@ee<ENG> (these). And after these words, Avraham was informed of Yitzchok’s destined mate. Rashi instead follows the Midrash of, “[After] the @ITwords@it of the thoughts that came about as a result of the @ITAkeidah@it.” [But these “words”] are not mentioned in Scripture at all! Continues the @ITRe’m@it: [Rashi says,] “Therefore, Hashem announced to him that Rivkah, Yitzchok’s destined mate, had been born.” It is implied that this was immediately [after the @ITakeidah.@it But is it not written @hh<HEB>אחרי@ee<ENG>, which Rashi states in many places that it always means “after a long time”? The answer is: It is called “after a long time” if it is not immediate and without delay.<QC>
@p1[1]@p2<TIE>The reason @HB<HEB>שנה@BO<ENG> is written with every set<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. @boI.e., and Scripture does not gather the ones and the tens in a set, and the hundreds in a separate set, as it did in Parshiyos Bereishis and Noach. Rashi’s is not asking why it says @hh<HEB>שנה@ee<ENG> for 100 years whereas it says @hh<HEB>שנים@ee<ENG> for seven years, for also in Parshiyos Bereishis and Noach it is always written @hh<HEB>שנה@ee<ENG> for hundreds, and @hh<HEB>שנים@ee<ENG> for smaller numbers. Rather, Rashi’s question is about the middle @hh<HEB>שנה@ee<ENG>, written after twenty, for @hh<HEB>שנה@ee<ENG> is never written three times. Perforce, it is meant to be expounded upon. Since one of them is to be expounded, so too are the rest to be expounded. @p1@p2That every set is to be explained by itself@p3. I.e., each set bears its own meaning and does not join with the other sets to form a single sum, as numbers composed of ones, tens and hundreds usually do. This is because the repetitive @hh<HEB>שנה@ee<ENG> divides them, placing the ones on their own, and so the tens and the hundreds. According to this [Midrashic interpretation], it is not twenty-seven plus one hundred. Rather, twenty-seven represents the first years @ITwithin@it the one hundred. @p1@p2At one hundred years old she was like a twenty year old, regarding sin.@p3 Rashi implies that from this comparison we learn that all Sarah’s days were good. But Rashi’s next comment — “‘The years of Sarah’s life,’ they were all equally good” — implies that “The years of Sarah’s life” comes to teach that all her days were good. If so, Rashi seems to be contradicting himself! But in fact, this is not a question. On the contrary, from the comparison of one hundred to twenty regarding sin, we would not know that at one hundred she was beautiful as at twenty, since we learn only one quality from each set by itself. Therefore, we still need “‘The years of Sarah’s life,’ they were all equally good.” A further answer: Since @hh<HEB>שנה@ee<ENG> is repeated in order to compare one hundred to twenty, which are the first twenty years counting from her birth [see previous entry], therefore, the “twenty-seven” years are @ITwithin@it the one hundred and are not the additional years @ITafter@it the one hundred that the verse’s simple meaning infers. If so, we might think that during the twenty-seven years after the one hundred, she had sin and not beauty. This is why we need “The years of Sarah’s life,” to tell us that they were all equally good. And from “The years of Sarah’s life” alone, we would know just that her years were equally good in one quality. Thus it says @hh<HEB>שנה@ee<ENG> after each set, to compare them in both qualities: lack of sin and that she possessed beauty. And “The years of Sarah’s life” applies to both [qualities, telling us that in @ITall@it her years she possessed beauty and she was without sin]. (@ITR. Meir Stern@it) @p1@p2Just as when she was twenty she was not considered as having sinned<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Question: Here, Rashi implies that right after turning twenty she was subject to [Heavenly] punishment. But regarding “Noach produced Sheim<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (5:32), Rashi said that before the Torah was given, people were not subject to [Heavenly] punishment until the age of one hundred? The answer is: Sarah was subject to punishment right after turning twenty because they accepted the Torah upon themselves—and after the Torah was given, people were subject to punishment from the age of twenty. Thus, Scripture is telling us that even by post-Torah standards, she was without sin. (@ITRe’m@it) @p1[2]@p2<TIE>So called because of the four giants that were there<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 @ITRe’m@it writes: However, I do not know what brought @ITChazal@it to say that Kiryas Arba was named after the four giants [or the four couples], when the city’s ruler was himself named Arba! It is written: “And the name of Hebron previously was Kiryas Arba; he was the greatest man among the giants” (Yehoshua 14:15). @ITChazal@it should have said that Kiryas Arba means “the city of the man named Arba,” and then explain why @IThe@it was named Arba, rather than why the @ITcity@it was named Arba. The @ITRe’m@it answers: Perhaps it is because @ITChazal@it found a reason for the city to be called Arba, but not for its ruler to be called Arba. Therefore they explained that the city was so called because of [the four giants or] the four couples — and the city’s ruler was also called Arba, after his city’s name. @p1@p2Another explanation: So called because of the four couples that were buried there<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Both explanations are needed, because each on its own raises the question: Why does the city’s name not reflect the reason for its origin? If after the four giants, it should be named Kiryas Anakim, and if after the four couples, it should be named Kiryas Zugos — but not Kiryas Arba. Since it makes no difference that there were exactly four giants, or couples, the city should not be called after a number which is not the reason for its name. That is why Rashi uses both explanations — to say that Kiryas Arba is called after the fact that it contains certain things which relate to the number four. E.g., it has four giants and four couples. But it was not called after one thing alone. Furthermore, we could even say it was called after the thing itself, but was called a number for the sake of brevity. The word “Arba,” alludes to two things the city has, both related to the number four. And since both are equally alluded to, both are included. (@ITR. Meir Stern@it) @p1@p2From Beer Sheva.@p3 You might ask: How does Rashi know this? The answer is: Since the verse does not specify where he came from, it must be from where he dwelled before. And Beer Sheva, written in 22:19, is the only place mentioned by Scripture in which Avraham dwelled after the @ITAkeidah@it. @p1@p2Sarah’s death immediately follows the Akeidah of Yitzchok<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi does not mean that the sections are juxtaposed, because if so he should have said this at the beginning of the Parshah. Furthermore, how does he know that this is not the section’s proper place, [so that the juxtaposition is significant]? Rather, [Rashi means that the events] are juxtaposed in time, as @ITChazal@it had an oral tradition that Sarah died close to the @ITAkeidah@it, and they found support for this in the phrase, “Avraham came.” [Although Avraham came from Beer Sheva, he was there for just a short while (see Rashi on 22:19), so it is as if he came straight from the @ITAkeidah@it.] (@ITRe’m@it) @p1@p2As a result of the news of the Akeidah, that her son had been prepared for slaughter<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Otherwise, why does the Torah write, “Avraham came,” teaching that he came from Mount Moriah? [See end of previous entry.] Perforce it is to tell us, “As a result<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1@p2And almost @BInot@BO been slaughtered, her soul departed from her and she died.@p3 You might ask: Should Rashi not have said, “Almost @ITbeen@it slaughtered”? The answer is: An emissary came from Mount Moriah, told her about the @ITAkeidah@it, and began to say how her son had been prepared for slaughter. He delayed the end of his account that Yitzchok was actually saved from slaughter. He “almost” told her that Yitzchok had “not been slaughtered,” but a moment before, she became so shocked by his words that her spirit and soul departed. (@ITMahara’i@it)<QC>
@p1[4]@p2<TIE>For God has told me, “To your descendants I will give this land.”@p3 You might ask: Rashi explained in Parshas Lech Lecha, on “The Canaanites and the Perizzites were then living in the land” (13:7), that Avraham did not yet have possession of the land. Does this not imply that Avraham did not have a portion in it as yet? The answer is: In the above verse, Avraham did not yet have children, but now he did. This is why Rashi states here that Hashem said to him: “To your@IT descendants@it I will give this land” — and now he had descendants. Accordingly, [Avraham said to them]: “At least grant me the possession of a grave site, although my descendants are not yet ready to inherit the land, as they are still few.” @p1@p2The possession of land to serve as a burial place@p3. Rashi is answering the question: How can the word @hh<HEB>אחוזה@ee<ENG> apply to a grave, which is a cavity in the ground? The word @hh<HEB>אחוזה@ee<ENG> applies only to an object with substance! Therefore Rashi says an @hh<HEB>אחוזה@ee<ENG> of land to serve as a burial place. Accordingly, @hh<HEB>אחוזה@ee<ENG> refers to the land. But @ITRe’m@it explains that [Rashi is answering the question:] The word @hh<HEB>אחוזה@ee<ENG> applies to land that is at a person’s disposal. How then can it apply to a grave, which is set aside for the dead? Therefore Rashi explains that [Avraham asked] them to give him land for an @hh<HEB>אחוזה@ee<ENG>, and he will make graves there.<QC>
@p1[6]@p2<TIE>Will not withhold as in, “You will not withhold (@HB<HEB>לא תכלא@ee@BO<ENG>) <TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”@p3 Although the word in our verse ends with a @hh<HEB>ה@ee<ENG>, and the word cited by Rashi ends with an @hh<HEB>א@ee<ENG>, they still mean the same: “will not withhold.” [Rashi is saying that] our verse does not mean “destruction” (@hh<HEB>כליון@ee<ENG>), as in “Destruction (@hh<HEB>כלה@ee<ENG>) shall come upon them” (18:21), or “For destruction (@hh<HEB>כלה@ee<ENG>) and annihilation” (Yeshayahu 10:23), although those words indeed end with a @hh<HEB>ה@ee<ENG> like the word in this verse (@hh<HEB>יכלה@ee<ENG>). This is because this verse would not be understandable if @hh<HEB>יכלה@ee<ENG> meant “destruction.”<QC>
@p1[9]@p2<TIE>Another explanation: It is doubled with couples@p3. [You might ask: Why did Rashi need to bring two explanations? The answer is:] These two explanations reflect two opinions in Eiruvin 53a. They are telling us not to mistakenly think that the cave itself was double—one cave within the other, or one cave on top of the other—for then it should have said @hh<HEB>מער@hbה@hh הכפולה@ee<ENG>, “the double cave.” Since @hh<HEB>מער@hbה@ee<ENG> lacks the @hh<HEB>ת@ee<ENG> of the construct state, @hh<HEB>כפולה@ee<ENG> [would consequently be an adjective and] its feminine @hh<HEB>ה@ee<ENG> would refer back to [the feminine] @hh<HEB>מער@hbה@ee<ENG>. But with @hh<HEB>מער@hbת@ee<ENG> in the construct state, @hh<HEB>המכפלה@ee<ENG> is a noun meaning “doubleness.” Thus, @hh<HEB>מערת המכפלה@ee<ENG> denotes “a cave of some other doubleness.” One opinion is that it was so named for the doubleness of the building (a house with an upper level above it) and the other opinion is that it was so named for the doubleness of the couples. And since Rashi does not decide which is closer to the plain meaning of Scripture, he cites both; they are equally good. A further answer: Rashi held that each explanation on its own raises the question: Why was the cave called @hh<HEB>מכפלה@ee<ENG>, after its doubleness, thereby omitting the main reason for its name? It should have been called after the main reason: according to one opinion, “Cave of House and Upper Level” or “Cave of Double Building”. And according to the other opinion, “Cave of Couples” or “Cave of Doubled Couples.” This is why Rashi brings both explanations—to say that it was called after the fact that it has certain things which relate to doubleness. These are: building and couples. But it was not called so for relating to only one matter. Alternatively, it was [so called] for the sake of brevity, to include two things in the word @hh<HEB>מכפלה@ee<ENG>. [Since both are equally hinted to,] both are included. We explained the name “Kiryas Arba” along similar lines. @p1[10]@p2<TIE>On that day they appointed him an officer over them<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 If it were written @hh<HEB>י@hbו@hhשב@ee<ENG> it would be in the present tense, denoting that he once lived as an equal in the midst of the sons of Cheis, and he still does. But it is written @hh<HEB>ישב@ee<ENG>, in the past tense, denoting that he once lived in their midst as an equal but no longer. [Therefore, Rashi deduces] that on that day they appointed him to be an officer. @p1@p2For they all left their work and came<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 It seems that Rashi deduced this from the fact that here it is written, “Who @ITcame to@it the city gate,” whereas in the story of Shechem it is written, “Who @ITleft@it the city gate” (34:24). Each verse makes a different point: Here, it teaches that even if someone had to do work, he left it to come pay respects to Sarah. There, it teaches that even if someone urgently needed to leave, he did not, but first circumcised himself—in order to cleave to the offspring of Yaakov. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it)<QC>
@p1[13]@p2<TIE>I do not wish this<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi needed [to add] this phrase, due to the word @hh<HEB>אך@ee<ENG> which always comes to exclude something stated previously. Here it excludes [Ephron’s previous offer, by saying]: “I do not wish this<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1@p2And I wish that I had already given it to you@p3. [Rashi makes this comment] because here it is speaking of money, which must be actually handed over [to validate the transaction]. However [in v. 11 it speaks of] land, which is at one’s disposal [one can say] “@ITas though@it I have already given it to you.” This is because land [is readily available and] doe need to be collected. (@ITMaharshal@it) But @ITR. Meir Stern@it writes: Here it says @hh<HEB>נתתי כסף@ee<ENG>, past tense, although it should have used future tense and said: “I @ITwill@it give you the money.” And Rashi explains it as: “I @ITwish@it that I had already given it to you.” And also in v. 11 it said @hh<HEB>השדה נתתיה@ee<ENG>, past tense, although it should have used future tense. Yet, Rashi explained it as: “@ITAs though@it I have already given it to you.” Why does Rashi explain it differently? [The answer is:] Here, Avraham said afterward: “Take it from me.” If @hh<HEB>נתתי כסף@ee<ENG> meant, “@ITAs though@it I have already given it to you,” he would not then say, “Take it from me.” If he already “gave” Ephron the money, then Ephron already “received” it, since by definition, giving entails receiving. That is why Rashi explains it as: “I @ITwish@it that I had already given.” Then it understandable for Avraham to say: “Therefore, now, take it from me.” But on v. 11, Rashi could not explain as he does here, because here it is written @hh<HEB>לו שמעני נתתי@ee<ENG>, and @hh<HEB>לו@ee<ENG> means “if only.” Here, @hh<HEB>לו@ee<ENG> can refer both to @hh<HEB>שמעני@ee<ENG>, “@ITIf only@it you would listen to me,” and to @hh<HEB>נתתי@ee<ENG>, “@ITIf only@it I had already given.” But in v. 11 it does not [say @hh<HEB>לו@ee<ENG>]. However, if it were not written here, “Take it from me,” we would not be forced to say that @hh<HEB>לו@ee<ENG> refers also to @hh<HEB>נתתי@ee<ENG>; we would say it refers only to @hh<HEB>שמעני@ee<ENG>. And we would rather have explained @hh<HEB>נתתי@ee<ENG> as in v. 11: [“@ITAs though@it I have already given it to you.”]. @p1[15]@p2<TIE>Between two friends such as we are, what significance does it have<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Why did Ephron say, “Between me and you”? How was Avraham different from anyone else? Rashi answers: “Between two friends such as we are.” Rashi then answers another question: Why did Ephron say: @hb<HEB>ו@hhאת מתך קבור@ee<ENG> (“@ITAnd@it bury your dead”? Rashi answers: Ephron was saying: “Disregard the sale, @ITand@it bury your dead.” @hb<HEB>ו@hhאת@ee<ENG> relates to, “Disregard the sale.”<QC>
@p1[16]@p2<TIE>Without a vav because he said much<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [You might ask:] Are not @hh<HEB>יעקב@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>אהרן@ee<ENG> also spelled without a @ITvav@it? [The answer is:] @hh<HEB>עפרון@ee<ENG> is spelled with a @ITvav@it throughout the parshah, and only here is written missing a @ITvav@it. Therefore, it is to be expounded. But @hh<HEB>יעקב@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>אהרן@ee<ENG> are always without a @ITvav@it. Where they have a @ITvav@it, it is to be expounded. @p1[17]@p2<TIE>It was elevated for it left the possession of a commoner to the possession of a king.@p3 [Accordingly,] @hh<HEB>ויקם@ee<ENG> does not mean acquisition, as in (Vayikra 25:30): “The house in the walled city shall be established (@hh<HEB>וקם@ee<ENG>), to the one who bought it,” where Rashi explains that possession is transferred from the seller to the buyer’s control. This is because there, the verse mentions the buyer after @hh<HEB>וקם@ee<ENG>, unlike here. [You might object: Here too, the next verse says]: “This became @ITAvraham’s@it through a purchase” — [thus mentioning the buyer after @hh<HEB>ויקם@ee<ENG>. The answer is:] That is not a continuation of the previous verse, since the @ITta’amei hamikra@it divide [it into a separate verse].<QC>
@p1@p2The simple meaning of the verse is: The field came into<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 It seems we could ask either way: If the simple meaning works well, [why do we need the first explanation?] Rashi does not usually bring a Midrash without reason! And if the simple meaning does not work well, why bring it? This question should be asked whenever Rashi brings both. The answer is: The simple meaning, on its own, raises a question. It is redundant to say, “The field @ITof Ephron@it<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. became Avraham’s through a purchase.” Why say, “Of Ephron”? Do we not already know it was his field? Perforce, an elevation took place specifically for the field of Ephron—it previously belonged to a commoner, Ephron. However, the exposition by the Midrash of “elevation,” when on its own, also raises a question. The verse already said, “The @ITfield@it of Ephron was established.” Why say again, “The @ITfield@it and the cave<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”? A further problem with the Midrash, [when on its own, is that] the next verse @hh<HEB>לאברהם למקנה@ee<ENG>. becomes somewhat disjointed Thus Rashi brings also the simple meaning: the field, etc, came into Avraham’s possession. It says, “The @ITfield@it of Ephron,” and then repeats, “The @ITfield@it and the cave<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” in order to indicate both explanations. Accordingly, @hh<HEB>ויקם@ee<ENG> applies to both. It applies to “The field of Ephron” to indicate “elevation.” And it applies to “The field and the cave” to indicate that it came into Avraham’s possession. In the simple meaning, @hh<HEB>ויקם@ee<ENG> denotes that possession of the field was transferred from the seller’s control and was established to the buyer, as Rashi exsimpleed on (Vayikra 25:30), “The house in the walled city shall be established (@hh<HEB>וקם@ee<ENG>)<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” The questions of @ITRe’m@it, and of the @ITMinchas Yehudah@it who came after him, are thus resolved. There is no need for their forced explanations, as @hb<HEB>ויקם@hh שדה@ee<ENG> and @hb<HEB>וקם@hh הבית@ee<ENG> both mean the same. In the simple meaning, @hh<HEB>ויקם השדה@ee<ENG> means that possession of the field was established in the buyer’s control, the same as Rashi exsimpleed for @hh<HEB>וקם הבית@ee<ENG>. Rashi understands the word @hh<HEB>וקם@ee<ENG> to mean “shall be established,” and only says “in the control of the buyer” to exsimple that verse’s following phrase: “To the one who bought it.” The same applies here: @hh<HEB>ויקם@ee<ENG> means the field was established to Avraham. Whereas @ITRe’m@it and @ITMinchas Yehudah@it understood that according to Rashi there, @hh<HEB>וקם@ee<ENG> means “acquisition” [and thus conflicts with its meaning here]. But this is not so, and it is difficult to understand why they said this. (@ITR. Meir Stern@it) @p1[18]@p2<TIE>And in the presence of all, he gave him possession@p3. [The prefix] @hh<HEB>ב@ee<ENG> usually denotes “within.” But since “within” or “inside” does not fit here, Rashi says: “In the presence of all.” Rashi did not wish to explain here as in v. 10, that everyone left their work, because then Scripture should have written @hb<HEB>ל@hhכל@ee<ENG>, as it does there. Why is it written @hb<HEB>ב@hhכל@ee<ENG>, implying he was amongst them? Perforce, it is to be interpreted as “in the presence of all.”<QC>
@p1[1]@p2<TIE>Since he had a son he needed to find a wife for him@p3. Otherwise, why does it say this here? The reason Scripture does not write outright [that he had a son] is to teach us that the son was considered like “all things.” Before he had a son, he said (15:2), “What will You give me since I continue to be childless?” But now all his blessings were complete. (@ITGur Aryeh@it)<QC>
@p1[7]@p2<TIE>Whereas, above he did say, “And I will have you swear<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”@p3 I.e., it says in v. 3: “[God of heaven] and @ITGod of earth@it.”<QC>
@p1@p2From Ur Kasdim.@p3 @ITRe’m@it and @ITRamban@it discuss this at length. But it is clear that Rashi holds that @hh<HEB>ארץ מולדתו@ee<ENG> refers to Ur Kasdim, while @hh<HEB>מולדתו@ee<ENG> [without @hh<HEB>ארץ@ee<ENG>, as in v. 4] refers to his family in the city of Charan. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1[8]@p2<TIE>And you may take a wife for him from the daughters of Aner, Eshkol and Mamrei.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because Avraham said (v. 3), “[You shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites] @ITamong whom I live@it.” Avraham commanded Eliezer from the daughters of the Canaanites @ITamong whom I live@it.” Avraham commanded Eliezer not to take a wife from the people they lived among, i.e., Aner, Eshkol and Mamrei, who were Avraham’s allies. So when it is written here, “You are @ITabsolved@it from this oath,” it also refers to Aner, Eshkol and Mamrei. @p1[10]@p2<TIE>They would go out only muzzled, out of concern for robbery<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because it is written (v. 32): “And he removed the muzzles the camels,” which implies that until now they were muzzled. [You might ask: Why was muzzling necessary?] Hashem does not bring wrongdoing to the animals of the righteous, as it says in Chulin 7a! An answer is: Hashem surely does not bring them wrongdoing but Eliezer muzzled them so they will not eat even [what is lying near] the sides of the road. Although the produce there is considered abandoned since the owners assumedly gave up hope [of recovering it], Eliezer the servant of Avraham was very pious and did not wish to benefit from another’s property even when permitted. But @ITRe’m@it answers that one should not rely on a miracle. [Although Hashem usually protects,] it is different where harm is sure to happen, as the camels were going among other people’s fields. @p1@p2He wrote a gift-deed to Yitzchok of all his possessions<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because when the verse says: “He departed, and all the property of his master was in his hand,” a new point is being expressed: even though Eliezer departed, all his master’s property was still in his hand. If all the verse means is that the property remained in Eliezer’s possession, why does the verse even need to tell us this? [It would be obvious, so] what is the new point? Furthermore, why did Scripture not tell us this in the previous section, that all his master’s property was in his possession? Perforce, it means that Avraham gave a gift-deed to Yitzchok. But @ITRe’m@it writes that [Rashi knows this] because there is no other way that all his master’s property would be “in his hand.” Avraham surely would not grant all his money to Eliezer! We need not ask: It is written later (25:5), “Avraham gave all that he possessed to Yitzchok.” Does this not imply that he did not give a gift-deed to Yitzchok beforehand? [An answer is:] Rashi explained there in the name of R. Nechemia [that Avraham gave Yitzchok] the blessing of Hashem, Who had said to Avraham, “And you will be [in control of the world’s] blessing.” Avraham then entrusted the blessings to Yitzchok. A further answer: Avraham acquired possessions after his gift-deed to Yitzchok, during the ten years following Sarah’s death. Avraham, upon his death, bequeathed them to Yitzchok.<QC>
@p1[17]@p2<TIE>Because he saw the water rise toward her@p3. Rashi is answering the question: Why does the verse say: “Toward her”? Since she already filled the pitcher and came up from the well, it should say he ran @ITafter@it her, as he had been standing by the well next to her, as it is written (v. 13): “Behold, here I stand by this well of water.” Perforce, “toward her” means he ran after her because of the @ITwater@it which rose @ITtoward@it her. (cited in the name of R. Avraham of Prague) @ITMaharshal@it explains: It seems that Eliezer was not standing right at the well, but some distance from it. And Rashi deduced [his comment] from the fact that it is written, “The @ITservant@it ran.” Why is it not written, “He ran,” similar to the preceding verses? Perforce, [it comes to say] that since he was Avraham’s servant he knew that Avraham was used to such miracles, as seen in (21:30) @hh<HEB>שבע כבשות האלה@ee<ENG> [where Rashi explains: “And the waters rose towards Avraham.” Thus,] Eliezer ran toward her, thinking: “She is worthy for the House of Avraham since the water even rises toward her, like for Avraham.”<QC>
@p1[19]@p2<TIE>Because that is the end of their drinking—when they have had enough to drink.@p3 Accordingly, @hh<HEB>כלו@ee<ENG> is not from @hh<HEB>כלייה@ee<ENG> (“finished off”), as the Targum for that word is @hh<HEB>גמירא@ee<ENG>. @p1[21]@p2<TIE>Because the verb “drink” does not take an @HB<HEB>א@ee<ENG>. Rashi is saying: [If it means “drinking”] why is there an @hh<HEB>א@ee<ENG>? It is plausible according to Onkelos, who said it means @hh<HEB>שהייה@ee<ENG> (waiting), for the verb root is @hh<HEB>שהי@ee<ENG> or @hh<HEB>שהה@ee<ENG>. Thus, the @hh<HEB>א@ee<ENG> replaces the third letter of the root, which is @hh<HEB>י@ee<ENG> or @hh<HEB>ה@ee<ENG>. But if it means @hh<HEB>שתייה@ee<ENG> (drinking) whose root is @hh<HEB>שתה@ee<ENG>, then all three letters of the root are found in @hh<HEB>משתאה@ee<ENG>. [Why is there an @hh<HEB>א@ee<ENG>?]. @p1[22]@p2<TIE>This is symbolic of the shekels of Israel, a @HB<HEB>בקע@ee@BO<ENG> per head@p3. Otherwise, why does it tell us, “Weighing half a shekel”? It was not a tremendous weight! The same is true for, “Weighing ten gold shekels.” @ITChazal@it interpreted “two bracelets” as they did because of the question: Why does it need to say “two”? [We always assume the minimum, and] the least number that the term “bracelets” could be referring to is two. @p1[23]@p2<TIE>He asked her this after giving her<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Although in Eliezer’s recount to Lavan (v. 47) it is written that he first asked and then he gave, Rashi explained there that Eliezer changed the story so they would not catch [something incongruous] in his words. Eliezer’s recount to Lavan cannot be the primary version, while here [we apply the rule that] Torah narratives are not always in chronological order, because within one topic the Torah observes chronological order. (@ITRe’m@it) A question on the @ITRe’m@it: In the beginning of Parshas Vayeira, Rashi explains on, “He said, My Master<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (18:3), that the Torah is not following chronological order. Yet there, it is within one topic! And Rashi there brings proof from, “My spirit will not continue to judge man forever” (6:3). @p1@p2One night’s lodging@p3. Otherwise, why does it not say the same in both places: either @hh<HEB>ללין@ee<ENG> or @hh<HEB>ללון@ee<ENG>? @d1@HB<HEB>לין@BO<ENG> is a noun.@d2 This noun is similar to @hh<HEB>שיר@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>ניר@ee<ENG>. But @hh<HEB>ללון@ee<ENG> is an infinitive that can mean many lodgings or one lodging.<QC>
@p1[28]@p2<TIE>And a daughter confides only in her mother.@p3 Although it is written about Rachel: “She ran and told her @ITfather@it” (29:12), that was because her mother had died. (@ITBereishis Rabbah@it) @p1[29]@p2<TIE>Why did he run and for what did he run?@p3 Rashi is not asking why Lavan ran, and answering, “He said, ‘This one is rich<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>..’” Rather, Rashi is arranging the verses, as they are not written in chronological sequence. It should have said first, “When he had seen the nose ring and the bracelets on the hands of his sister, and heard the words of his sister<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” and then, “He ran.” That is the sequence: Lavan saw the ring, heard his sister’s words, and ran. Also, it is not feasible that [the sequence follows the order of the verses]: first he ran, then he saw the ring and heard his sister’s words, and then he went out to the man. An even greater [break in sequence is that] in the middle, it says Lavan saw the ring. [On the contrary,] “He ran” and “He came” should be next to one another, not interrupted by, “When he had seen<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” All this brought Rashi to explain, “‘He ran.’ Why did he run<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.?” Rashi is saying that the verses are written in this order so they will [state that Lavan ran, and then] explain @ITwhy@it he ran. Furthermore, there are two [possible] reasons why Lavan ran: seeing the ring, and hearing his sister’s words. When Rashi says, “And for what did he run?” he is asking: for which reason did he run? [Rashi answers:] “He saw” and “He ran” are written next to each other to show that he ran because, upon seeing the ring, he said: “He is rich.” It was not because he heard Rivkah’s words, [in which case we could] judge him favorably, that he ran to honor Eliezer or for some other reason, and not out of his lust for money. Whereas if “He saw” and “He heard” would have been written before “He ran,” [in chronological sequence,] we would not know what he ran for, or if it was for both reasons. This is why Rashi carefully quotes the wording of the verse: “Why ‘He ran’? ‘When he had seen the nose ring<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.’” From this we see that Rashi’s true intention is to arrange the verses so they will be orderly and connected. He does this by inserting a few [explanatory] words into the verses, which is his practice in most places, as known by those familiar with Rashi’s ways. Whereas if Rashi merely intended to ask and answer, as certain commentators explained, then he should [have paraphrased] and said: “Why did he run? He said, ‘This one is rich’<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>..” [According to them,] that which Rashi quotes, “When he had seen the nose ring,” before explaining, “This one is rich<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>..” is completely not understandable. (@ITR. Meir Stern@it) @p1[30]@p2<TIE>To watch over them<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Otherwise it should say @hh<HEB>רוכב על הגמלים@ee<ENG> rather than@hh<HEB>עומד על הגמלים@ee<ENG>. @p1[31]@p2<TIE>Of idols@p3. Otherwise, it would be sufficient to say there is a place for the camels, or a place to lodge, [without mentioning, “I have emptied the house.”] @p1[33]@p2<TIE>Here @HB<HEB>אם@ee@BO<ENG> is used as a term for @HB<HEB>אשר@ee@BO<ENG> as well as @bo@hh<HEB>כי@ee@BO<TIE><ENG>.<TIE>.<TIE>. @boRashi is answering the question: @hh<HEB>אם@ee<ENG> [in its usual sense of “if”] implies uncertainty whether Eliezer spoke. Yet, he surely spoke! Rashi answers: @hh<HEB>אם@ee<ENG> [also] means “that,” [as seen from the] @hh<HEB>כי@ee<ENG> in @hh<HEB>עד @hbכי@hh יבא שילה@ee<ENG> (49:10), where @hh<HEB>כי@ee<ENG> means “that.” [And since @hh<HEB>כי@ee<ENG> means @hh<HEB>אם@ee<ENG>, as Rashi explains here, it follows that] @hh<HEB>אם@ee<ENG> means “that.” @p1@p2This is what is meant when our Sages said<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: [@hh<HEB>אם@ee<ENG> means “that”] because @hh<HEB>אם@ee<ENG> is like @hh<HEB>כי@ee<ENG>, [and @hh<HEB>כי@ee<ENG> means “that”]. But @hh<HEB>כי@ee<ENG> has only four meanings, @hh<HEB>אלא דילמא אי דהא@ee<ENG>, and @hh<HEB>אם@ee<ENG> is not one of them! If so, how do we know that @hh<HEB>אם@ee<ENG> means “that”? Rashi answers: “This is what is meant when our Sages said<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. and one is @hh<HEB>אי@ee<ENG> @ITwhich means@it @hh<HEB>אם@ee<ENG>.” Thus we see that @hh<HEB>כי@ee<ENG> means @hh<HEB>אם@ee<ENG>. Here too, @hh<HEB>אם@ee<ENG> is like @hh<HEB>כי@ee<ENG>, and means “that.”<QC>
@p1[37]@p2<TIE>And she will not be willing to follow you@p3. [This comment] solves three problems. First, [in v. 38] it connects @hh<HEB>תלך@ee<ENG> to @hh<HEB>לא@ee<ENG>, as if it were written @hh<HEB>אם לא תלך אל בית אבי@ee<ENG>. [This solves the problem] that @hh<HEB>לא@ee<ENG> does not fit with [its following word] @hh<HEB>אל@ee<ENG>. Second, [Rashi’s addition of] “And she will not be willing to follow you” [solves the problem] that otherwise it would imply: as soon as you go to my father’s house you will be absolved of the oath not to take a wife from the Canaanites, whether or not she is willing to follow you. [Third, in the phrase, “Unless you @ITfirst@it go<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”] Rashi adds the word “first” [to solve the problem] that otherwise it would imply: if you take a wife from the Canaanites, and @ITafterwards@it go [to my family,] and she is not willing to follow you, you still will be absolved of my oath. But this is not so, as Eliezer was not allowed [to take a Canaanite wife] unless he @ITfirst@it went [to Avraham’s family] and she would not be willing to follow him. [Accordingly, the final phrase in v. 38,] “Take a wife for my son,” begins a new sentence. It is as if saying: “Rather, you should take a wife for my son from my family, as mentioned above.” @p1[39]@p2<TIE>It is written @HB<HEB>אלי@ee@BO<ENG>. Eliezer had a daughter<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 You might ask: Above (v. 5), when Eliezer first said to Avraham, “Perhaps (@hh<HEB>א@hbו@hhלי@ee<ENG>) the woman will not be willing,” why was it not spelled @hh<HEB>אלי@ee<ENG> there, for this exposition? The answer is: There, it is followed by, “Shall I bring your son back to the land from where you came?” There, it does not imply that Eliezer was looking for an excuse. Rather, he was asking: if she will not come with me, should I bring Yitzchok to them? But here, since this is not written afterwards, it is for this exposition. (@ITMahara’i@it) Another answer: After Lavan said to Eliezer (v. 31), “Come, you who are @ITblessed@it of Hashem,” Eliezer thought: “Now I am blessed! Perhaps Yitzchok will marry my daughter.” Thus here, it is spelled @hh<HEB>אלי@ee<ENG>, for this exposition. But above, Eliezer was not yet blessed. The @ITMaharshal@it answers: Eliezer never thought he would become Avraham’s in-law, because Avraham was blessed but he was cursed. Rather, Eliezer feared that once he told them he was under oath to take a wife specifically from Avraham’s family, they would extort him for a great sum of money. Thus he told them @hh<HEB>אלי@ee<ENG>, to hint to them that he had a daughter. @p1@p2And one who is cursed cannot cleave to one who is blessed@p3. I.e., Eliezer came from Canaan, of whom it is written (9:25): “Cursed be Canaan.” You might ask: Aner, Eshkol and Mamrei were also cursed, as they were Amorites, [who also come from Canaan]. The answer is: The curse was actualized in Eliezer, as he was a slave. Thus, he was more cursed than they. This resolves the difficulty of @ITRe’m@it on v. 8.<QC>
@p1[52]@p2<TIE>From here [we learn] that thanks should be given for good tidings.@p3 You might ask: Why did Rashi not make this comment above, on: “The man bowed his head and prostrated himself” (v. 26)? An answer is: Above, it is followed by: “He said, ‘Blessed is Hashem, God of my master, Avraham.’” Perhaps there, he prostrated himself because he mentioned Hashem’s Name in a @ITbrocho@it, as “blessed” means a @ITbrocho@it. But here, no @ITbrocho@it follows. The @ITKitzur Mizrachi@it answers: The Bereishis Rabbah (60:7) made this comment on, “The man bowed his head and prostrated himself” (v. 26). But Rashi makes it here, because Eliezer could not have given thanks until after they said (v. 51), “Take her and go.” But, when he first spoke to Rivkah, he did not yet know if she would agree to go with him!<QC>
@p1[55]@p2<TIE>He wanted to prevent .<TIE>.<TIE>. [therefore] an angel came and killed him.@p3 Besueil poisoned the food in Eliezer’s plate, and then he rushed Eliezer to eat before he would notice it. For it is written here (v. 33), “Food was @ITset@it before him,” and about Yosef also it is written (50:26), “He was @ITset@it in a coffin.” Here, too, they sought to kill Eliezer and put him in a coffin. But Eliezer realized it and said (v. 33), “I will not eat until I have spoken my words.” In the meantime, the angel moved the plate and the poison ended up in front of Besueil, who ate the poisoned food and died. (@ITsource unknown@it)<QC>
@p1[57]@p2<TIE>From here [it is derived], that a woman may not be given in marriage unless it is with her consent@p3. Rashi is answering the question: They said before (v. 50), “We cannot say anything to you, bad or good,” as it is clearly ordained by Hashem. [Why then did they now need to ask her?] @p1[58]@p2<TIE>Of my own accord<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Why did she answer, “I will @ITgo@it,” instead of simply saying, “Yes”? For they had asked her, “Will you @ITgo@it with this man?” (@ITRe’m@it)<QC>
@p1[60]@p2<TIE>May you and your descendants receive the same blessing<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi said, “May it be His will that those @ITdescendants@it<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” [but did not speak directly of her,] because the blessings were given to Yitzchok, not to Rivkah. [You might ask:] Is it not written [that they said to her, “May @ITyou@it become thousands of myriads,” even though she was not included in the blessings [to Yitzchok]? The answer is: If her descendants receive the blessing, it is considered as though she received it herself.<QC>
@p1[62]@p2<TIE>It is between Kadeish and Bered.@p3 Bered and Shur are the same place, as Onkelos translates both as @hh<HEB>חגרא@ee<ENG>. Since it is written about one of them, “To the land of the Negev” (20:1), and it is written about the other that the well was there (16:14), they derived that the land of the Negev [where Yitzchok lived] was close to that well. @p1[63]@p2<TIE>A term for prayer, as in, “He pours out his prayer.”@p3 Question: For the verse @hh<HEB>ישפוך שיחו@ee<ENG> (Tehillim 102:1), the Gemara in Avodah Zarah 7b uses the verse over here @hh<HEB>לשוח בשדה@ee<ENG> as a source that @hh<HEB>שיח@ee<ENG> means prayer [as if @ITour@it verse was the source]?! Tosafos answer (in Berachos 26b) that this is the way of the Gemara. For we see that the Gemara (Megillah 13a) proves Esther was righteous because it is written about her (Esther 2:7), “He brought up @ITHadassah@it,” and it is written (Zechariah 1:7), “And he was standing among the @IThadassim@it.” Just as in Zechariah 1:7 it refers to the righteous, so too in Esther 2:7. Yet, in Sanhedrin (93a) the Gemara brings the proof the other way around. But this does not seem right to me. Rather, the answer is: Both verses are needed [to prove that @hh<HEB>שיח@ee<ENG> means prayer.] With @hh<HEB>ישפוך שיחו@ee<ENG> alone, we would think that @hh<HEB>שיח@ee<ENG> means speech, not prayer, since that same verse already said @hh<HEB>תפלה לעני@ee<ENG>. But @hh<HEB>לשוח בשדה@ee<ENG> [must mean prayer, for] with whom was Yitzchok speaking? Perforce, he established [the afternoon] prayer. And with @hh<HEB>לשוח בשדה@ee<ENG> alone, we would think that @hh<HEB>לשוח@ee<ENG> means as it does in Demai 1:1: “@hh<HEB>בנות שוח@ee<ENG> (white figs).” I.e., Yitzchok went for a walk among the trees in the field. This is why Rashi brings a proof from @hh<HEB>ישפוך שיחו@ee<ENG>. (@ITMaharshal@it)<QC>
@p1[64]@p2<TIE>She saw that he was majestic and was astonished at his sight.@p3 Otherwise, how did she know it was [someone important like] Yitzchok, so that she let herself down from the camel? @p1@p2She leaned towards the ground but did not reach the ground@p3. [Rashi knows this] because it is written @hh<HEB>ותפול מ@hbעל@hh הגמל@ee<ENG>, rather than @hh<HEB>מהגמל@ee<ENG> @hh<HEB>ותפול@ee<ENG> or @hh<HEB>ותפול לארץ@ee<ENG>. Consequently, it implies that she let herself down from the camel’s back, but not to the ground. @p1@p2Similarly, @HB<HEB>כי יפול לא יוטל@ee@BO<TIE><ENG>.<TIE>.<TIE>. @boEven though he falls he will not be cast to the ground, as Rashi goes on to explain: “He will not reach the ground.” @p1[65]@p2<TIE>As in @HB<HEB>ותקבר@ee@BO<ENG> and @HB<HEB>ותשבר@ee@BO<ENG>. @boThese verbs refer to the object of the action, and are in the @hh<HEB>נפעל@ee<ENG> (passive) form. So too with @hh<HEB>ותתכס@ee<ENG>: it is reflexive, and she was the object of the action.<QC>
@p1[67]@p2<TIE>That is, she became the image of his mother Sarah.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because it should have said @hh<HEB>ויביאה @hbל@hhאהל שרה אמו@ee<ENG>, in which case @hh<HEB>אהל@ee<ENG> would be connected to @hh<HEB>שרה@ee<ENG>, [meaning “Sarah’s tent.”] But @hh<HEB>האהלה@ee<ENG> is an independent phrase. @p1@p2For, as long as Sarah was alive a candle burned<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 They correspond to the three mitzvos which women are commanded (Shabbos 2:6). Corresponding to challah, there was a constant blessing. Corresponding to Shabbos candles, a lamp burned. And the cloud which hung [over the tent] represented the Shechinah. It was there due to the holiness of purity: she carefully observed [the laws of] @ITnidah@it and would purify herself. And purity brings @ITruach hakodesh@it (Avodah Zarah 20b). (@ITGur Aryeh@it) @p1@p2As long as one’s mother is alive<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Otherwise, why does it say @hh<HEB>אחרי אמו@ee<ENG>? @p1[1]@p2<TIE>Because her deeds were as beautiful as @HB<HEB>קטורת@BO<ENG>.@p3 But [the first explanation] raises a question: Why was she not named Ketores? Thus Rashi offers the [second] explanation: “Because she ‘tied her womb.’” And the second explanation raises a question: Why was she not named Keshurah, which means “tied” in Hebrew, instead of Keturah, which means “tied” in Aramaic? Therefore, Rashi offers the first explanation. (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1@p2Did not mate with any man from<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. she separated from Avraham.@p3 [You might ask: Why were her deeds so beautiful?] Rashi explained above (21:14), “She returned to her family’s idolatry”! The answer is: She had in mind to return to idolatry because she thought, “Since I was rejected from the House of Avraham, his God has also left me.” But when she saw the miracle of the well for her son, and the angel revealing himself to her, she did not abandon Hashem. (@ITKitzur Mizrachi@it)<QC>
@p1[3]@p2<TIE>The name of the heads of nations.@p3 I.e., from one of Dedan’s sons descended all the Ashurim, and so from the second one [descended all the Letushim]. Otherwise, it should say Ashur and Latush, [in singular]. (@ITRe’m@it) But @ITGur Aryeh@it explains: Otherwise it should say @hh<HEB>ובני דדן אשורים ולטושים@ee<ENG>. Why does it say @hh<HEB>היו@ee<ENG>? Perforce, because they are “the name of the heads of nations.” @p1[5]@p2<TIE>He gave him @HB<HEB>ברכת דייתיקי@ee@BO<ENG>.@p3 [According to the first approach, @hh<HEB>ברכת דייתיקי@ee<ENG> means “the blessing of Hashem,” and] Rashi is answering the question: Did not Avraham already give Yitzchok all he had (see Rashi on 24:10)? The word @hh<HEB>דייתיקי@ee<ENG> comes from @hh<HEB>עתיק יומין@ee<ENG>, which means “Hashem.” Alternatively, @hh<HEB>דייתיקי@ee<ENG> comprises three words, @hh<HEB>דאי תהא קאי@ee<ENG>, and means, “the gift will be established.” In other words, Avraham now gave Yitzchok active possession of the property he had previously granted him. @p1[6]@p2<TIE>It is written lacking<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. there was only one concubine.@p3 Rashi knows this because other concubines were not written of, only Hagar. (@ITsource unknown@it) @p1@p2Wives are with a kesubah, concubines are<TIE>without a kesubah.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: If the concubine mentioned here is Hagar, why before (v. 1) is she called a wife? The answer is: Scripture called her a wife because she had a kesubah like a wife. And it calls her a concubine because Avraham took her only for conjugal relations and not for child-bearing. The word @hh<HEB>פלגש@ee<ENG> connotes @hh<HEB>פלג אשה@ee<ENG> (a half wife): one who is for conjugal relations and not for child-bearing. @p1@p2Our sages explained that he transmitted to them impure names<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 This means [names for] handling demons. Alternatively, it means names [of Hashem] that may be uttered in a state of impurity, as he knew that these sons will not keep themselves pure, so he did not transmit to them Names that require a state of purity. @p1@p2He transmitted to them impure names.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because Avraham had already given all his possessions to Yitzchok.<QC>
@p1[9]@p2<TIE>From here .<TIE>.<TIE>. that Yishmael repented<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Why does Scripture mention Yitzchok before Yishmael, when Yishmael was older?<QC>
@p1[11]@p2<TIE>He comforted him .<TIE>.<TIE>. for comforting the bereaved.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because if you think “Elokim blessed” follows its simple meaning, why does Scripture say, “After Avraham died”? What does it matter if He blessed Yitzchok during Avraham’s lifetime or after? (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1@p2He was afraid to give the blessings to Yitzchok<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 You might ask: Did not Rashi say before (v. 5) that Avraham gave the blessings to Yitzchok? The answer is: Avraham empowered him to bless others, but Yitzchok himself was not blessed [until now]. And so wrote @ITNachalas Yaakov@it.<QC>
@p1[13]@p2<TIE>In order of their birth, one after another@p3. Rashi is saying that @hh<HEB>בשמותם לתולדותם@ee<ENG> means, [“Their names] in the order of their birth.” Otherwise, why is this phrase said?

@p1[19]@p2<TIE>Yaakov and Eisov who are discussed in this parshah.@p3 Meaning: wherever it is written, “@ITAnd@it these,” it is a continuation of that which preceded. Just as Avraham fathered a righteous son and a wicked one, so too did Yitzchok father a righteous son and a wicked one. @p1@p2Because the scoffers of the generations were saying<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 @ITRe’m@it writes: The reason that Scripture needed to verify that Yitzchok was Avraham’s son was because [the Torah’s writing of, “@ITAnd@it these are the descendants of Yitzchok son of@IT Avraham@it,”] brought about the scoffers of the generation to claim that Sarah conceived from Avimelech. But @ITRe’m’s@it reason is not correct. Because if so, let it not write the “and” [which connects it to the preceding narrative.] And let it not write the @hh<HEB>ה@ee<ENG> [of @hh<HEB>אבר@hbה@hhם@ee<ENG>, but rather omit mention of Avraham altogether]. It should say simply, @hh<HEB>אלה תולדות יצחק@ee<ENG>, as it says @hh<HEB>אלה תולדות נח@ee<ENG> (6:9) and @hh<HEB>אלה תולדות יעקב@ee<ENG> (37:2). [This way, Scripture would not elicit the scoffing in the first place.] Rather, Rashi means as follows: Our @ITParshah@it discusses Yaakov and Eisov, one of whom was righteous, and the other, wicked. Due to them, our verse needs to offer explanation. So we need not ask why it writes “@ITAnd@it these,” and @hh<HEB>אבר@hbה@hhם@ee<ENG>, because [the answer is:] The scoffers of the generations were already claiming at the time of Yitzchok’s birth [that Sarah conceived] from Avimelech. And now, they found support for their claim! One son [of Yitzchak’s] was righteous like Sarah, and the other, wicked like Avimelech. [They claimed] that both sons would be righteous if they came from Avraham. [Our P@ITarshah@it is thus connected to an earlier narrative, explaining why it says, “@ITAnd@it these.”] This is the reason it was necessary to say, “Yitzchok son of @ITAvraham@it,” and support it by saying, “Avraham was the father of Yitzchok,” [implying that Yitzchok’s face resembled Avraham’s]. And this is why Rashi concludes by saying: “This is the meaning of what is written @IThere@it<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>..” It is written @IThere@it because one son was righteous and the other wicked, [as discussed in our @ITParshah@it]. Otherwise, it would be written in another place.

Rather, Rashi is answering the question: Why did Yitzchok not marry when he was eighteen or twenty? He fulfilled all the Torah, and was a beloved, only son to his father and mother. They should have married him off as soon as he was fit to have children. Rashi answers [that they waited for his destined mate to be born]: “For when<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (@ITRe’m@it) @p1@p2And at that time Rivkah was born.

[This question arises] because properly speaking, Yitzchok should have married earlier — but could not, as Avraham did not want to marry him to a Canaanite woman. We see this from, “After these words.<TIE>.<TIE>. Milkah has also born children to Nachor” (22:20). There Rashi comments, “The words of the thoughts that came about as a result of the Akeidah.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1@p2Until she was fit for marriage — three years — whereupon he married her.@p3 Although she was not fit to conceive, he married her nonetheless, so he would not have improper thoughts. @p1@p2That she was the daughter of a wicked person and the sister of a wicked person<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 You might object that the question still stands. When it said before that she was Besueil’s daughter and Lavan’s sister, we could have learned the same lesson, [so why is our verse needed?] The answer is: By writing this verse, Scripture is testifying that she truly was righteous and did not learn from their deeds.<QC>
@p1[21]@p2<TIE>To be implored and to be placated and swayed by him.@p3 [Rashi says this] because @hh<HEB>וַיֵrָתֶר@ee<ENG> (He granted his prayer) cannot mean “increase.” Rather it means “implore,” whose meaning is close to that of “increase.” [Although @hh<HEB>וַיֵrָתֶר@ee<ENG> comes later on in the verse,] this is why Rashi explains it before @hh<HEB>לנוכח אשתו@ee<ENG>: [in order to explain the meaning of the root @hh<HEB>עתר@ee<ENG>]. Since @hh<HEB>נתפצר@ee<ENG> [implies giving in due to pressure] and may not to be used for Hashem, Rashi adds the word @hh<HEB>נתפתה@ee<ENG>, conveying that Hashem “consented” to his request. @p1@p2It means imploring and increasing<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is explaining that @hh<HEB>עתר@ee<ENG> does not [generally] denote prayer, rather imploring. [Here,] it means he implored and increased his prayers. @p1@p2And similarly: “Exorbitant are the kisses of the enemy,” meaning, they@p3 @BO@ITseem@bo@it@BO exorbitant<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. @boRashi is answering the question: It was explained above that @hh<HEB>ונעתרות@ee<ENG> also means “increasing.” But why would an enemy increase his kisses? Thus Rashi explains that they @ITseem@it exorbitant and are burdensome. I.e., an enemy kisses only once, but it seems as if he kissed exorbitantly, and even the one kiss is burdensome. [You might ask:] Why did Rashi not mention @hh<HEB>נעתרות נשיקות שונא@ee<ENG> above, when he was explaining @hh<HEB>וַיֶrְתַר@ee<ENG> which also means increasing? The answer is: Above, we could have said that @hh<HEB>עתר@ee<ENG> has two [separate] meanings: imploring and increasing. This would be similar to @hh<HEB>וישבר למצרים@ee<ENG> (41:56), where Rashi explains that @hh<HEB>שבר@ee<ENG> can mean either selling or buying. Thus @hh<HEB>וַיֵrָתֶר@ee<ENG> could be explained as imploring, since increasing does not apply to Hashem — Heaven forbid we should say He “increased”! If so, @hh<HEB>נעתרות נשיקות שונא@ee<ENG> could also mean imploring: one must implore the enemy to kiss his adversary. But now that Rashi explained that even @hh<HEB>וַיֵrָתֶר@ee<ENG> means [something similar to] increasing, and that @hh<HEB>עתר@ee<ENG> @ITalways@it means increasing, we are forced to explain @hh<HEB>נעתרות נשיקות שונא@ee<ENG> as, “They seem exorbitant.” @p1@p2He was standing in one corner and praying<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Although @hh<HEB>לנוכח@ee<ENG> usually means “facing,” Rashi explains it differently here] because it is not normal to pray facing one another. @p1@p2“His” but not hers. For it is not comparable<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Why does it not say, “He granted @ITtheir@it prayers”? They both prayed! He answers: “‘His’ but not hers. For it is not comparable.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1[22]@p2<TIE>For it does not clarify what this struggle was<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Meaning: since Scripture does not explain the @hh<HEB>רציצה@ee<ENG>, assumedly it was [the standard @hh<HEB>רציצה@ee<ENG>,] like that of other pregnant women. But if so, why is it written afterwards, “If this is so, why did I desire this?” Did she not know she would have pregnancy pains? Perforce, as the Midrash says, @hh<HEB>רציצה@ee<ENG> means moving quickly, not what other women experience. About this Rashi later commented: “She said, ‘If this is so, that the pain of pregnancy is so great’” — more than that of other women — “‘Why did I desire this?’” @p1@p2To the house of study of Sheim@p3. [Rashi knows this] because otherwise it should simply say, “She inquired of Hashem.” Why does it say, “She went”? Hashem fills the whole world! And while Sheim was still alive, she would not go to the house of study of his grandson Eiver. We need not ask why she did not go to Avraham, as he too was a prophet, for the answer is: Hashem hid the meaning of her pregnancy from Avraham so he would not be pained [over his wicked grandson-to-be, Eisov]. We see that before Eisov fell into to evil ways, Avraham died, so that his death would be “in a @ITgood@it old age” (25:8). @p1[23]@p2<TIE>Through an intermediary@p3. We cannot say that Hashem told her Himself, as she did not speak to Hashem herself. Furthermore, Rashi knew this since it is written @hh<HEB>ויאמר ה' לה@ee<ENG>, rather than @hh<HEB>ויאמר לה ה'@ee<ENG> as it says for Hagar @hh<HEB>ויאמר לה מלאך@ee<ENG> (16:9) and for Rus @hh<HEB>ויאמר לה בועז@ee<ENG> (Rus 2:14). Perforce, @hh<HEB>ויאמר ה' לה@ee<ENG> means that Hashem told her through an intermediary. @hh<HEB>גיים@ee@p1@p2<ENG> is written. This refers to Antoninus and Rabbi<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 @hh<HEB>גיים@ee<ENG> means @hh<HEB>גאים@ee<ENG> (great and princely persons) because the @hh<HEB>י@ee<ENG> is in place of the @hh<HEB>א@ee<ENG>.<QC>
@p1@p2Whose tables never lacked radish or lettuce<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., Antoninus was a scion of Eisov, and Rabbi [referring to R. Yehudah HaNasi] was a scion of Yaakov. Question: Does it not say in Kesubos 104a that when Rabbi was dying, he lifted his ten fingers toward Heaven and said, “I did not benefit from this world even my little finger’s worth”? The answer is: Rabbi’s household would eat [the special foods], and his table was never lacking. This was the princeliness. But Rabbi himself did not eat them. (@ITRe’m@it) See @ITNachalas Yaakov@it. @p1@p2The word @HB<HEB>לאום@ee@BO<ENG> always means kingdom@bo. Otherwise, why does it say @hh<HEB>ושני לאומים@ee<ENG> [after it already said @hh<HEB>שני גוים@ee<ENG>]? But @ITR. Noson@it explained that Rashi knew this from the word @hh<HEB>יאמץ@ee<ENG>, which is used only for kings, as Rashi clearly states on Avodah Zarah 12b. @p1@p2Already from the womb they are separated<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 @ITRe’m@it writes that according to Rashi, @hh<HEB>יִפָרֵדו@ee<ENG> is to be understood as present tense, for Rashi writes @hh<HEB>הם נפרדים@ee<ENG> (they @ITare@it separated). Here, Hashem is not telling her what is in her womb. He already told her, “Two nations are in your womb.” He is rather telling her the nature of these nations. While still in the womb, as yet unborn, they are exceptionally separated from one another — one to his evil ways and the other to his wholesomeness. This is why Rashi writes @hh<HEB>נפרדים@ee<ENG>, present tense, rather than @hh<HEB>יִפָרֵדו@ee<ENG>, future tense. He is saying that already in the womb, they are separated. You might ask: Does the Sifrei not say that the evil inclination does not affect a person while he is his mother’s womb? For it is written (8:21), “The inclination of man’s heart is evil @hh<HEB>מנעריו@ee<ENG>,” meaning [that he has the evil inclination only] after he is shaken (@hh<HEB>ננער@ee<ENG>) from his mother’s womb. The answer is: Before a person is born, the evil inclination does not cause him to lust sins. But Eisov was drawn to the sin of idolatry because it was his nature. He sought out his own kind. (@ITGur Aryeh@it) @p1@p2When one rises the other falls<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., both of them cannot be great at the same time because when one rises the other falls. The @hh<HEB>מ@ee<ENG> of @hb<HEB>מ@hhלאום@ee<ENG> is [not] like the @hh<HEB>מ@ee<ENG> of @hb<HEB>מ@hhכל מלמדי השכלתי@ee<ENG> (Tehillim 119:99), which means “more than.” [In other words, @hb<HEB>מ@hhלאום@ee<ENG> does not imply a comparison, that one government has “more” power than the other.] Rather, the @hh<HEB>מ@ee<ENG> of @hb<HEB>מ@hhלאום@ee<ENG> means “from.” I.e., one government seizes power “from” the other [and thereby acquires its greatness.] Tyre is the kingdom of Eisov. @p1[25]@p2<TIE>A sign that he will be a murderer.@p3 [Rashi knows that] this was written here to be a sign, because otherwise, why would Scripture tell us he was reddish? Whereas it is understandable that it says he was hairy — this explains why his name is “Eisov.” Although it is written also about Dovid that “He was reddish” (Shmuel I 16:12), the earlier sages have explained in Bereishis Rabbah 63:8 that concerning Dovid it is written (ibid), “With beautiful eyes” — teaching that David shed blood according to the directives of the Sanhedrin, who are called “Eyes of the congregation” (Bamidbar 15:24). @p1@p2Full of hair like a woolen garment@p3. Rashi is answering the question: How can it say @hh<HEB>כאדרת שער@ee<ENG>, implying that a robe has hair? A robe is made of wool! Thus Rashi explains: “Full of hair like a woolen garment.” Rashi is saying that @hh<HEB>שער@ee<ENG> does not refer to @hh<HEB>אדרת@ee<ENG>. Rather, it conveys that Eisov was full of hair like a robe is full of @ITwool@it. (@ITRe’m@it) But @ITNachalas Yaakov@it writes: @ITRe’m@it forgot about the verse in Zechariah 13:4 which clearly states, “They will not wear a hairy robe (@hh<HEB>אדרת שער@ee<ENG>).” Thus, @hh<HEB>שער@ee<ENG> indeed refers to @hh<HEB>אדרת@ee<ENG>! Rather, our verse means that Eisov was completely full of hair like a robe that is full of @IThair@it. The verse should have said @hh<HEB>כולו @hbשער@hh כאדרת שער@ee<ENG>, but [did not because in the word @hb<HEB>כ@hhאדרת@ee<ENG>,] the @hh<HEB>כ@ee<ENG> conveys this point, since @hh<HEB>כ@ee<ENG> means “like.” And so explains @ITRadak@it in his entry on the word @hh<HEB>שער@ee<ENG>: “A robe has hair.” See there. @p1[26]@p2<TIE>I heard an Aggadaic exposition that interprets it according to its plain meaning<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: If it is written, “The first one came out,” why then is it not written, “The second one came out”? Rashi answers: I heard an Aggadah that explains why it does not say, “The second one.” Yaakov rightfully should have come out first, just as he was conceived first!<QC>
@p1@p2A sign that this one will not yet have completed his dominion<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Otherwise the verse should have [omitted all mention of “the heel of Eisov,” and] just said, “His hand grasping him.” @p1@p2God called him<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Why is it not written who named him? Furthermore, since it says [right afterward], “Yitzchok was sixty years old,” it is implied that until now the verse was not speaking of Yitzchok. Thus Rashi explains that Hashem named him. @p1@p2Another explanation: his father called him<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Question: If so,] why is Yitzchok not written? [The answer is:] So the gentiles will not say that Yaakov’s father called him so because he knew Yaakov would deceive Eisov twice. @p1@p2On account of his holding the heel.@p3 When Rashi said before that [holding the heel of Eisov is] “a sign that this one will not yet have completed his dominion,” this is according to the first explanation, that @ITHashem@it named him Yaakov. For if Hashem named him, we ask: “Why does it need to mention Eisov’s heel?” [And we answer:] “Perforce, it is a sign that<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” But according to the alternate explanation, that his @ITfather@it named him, it means that Eisov’s heel is not mentioned superfluously at all. It is needed to explain why his father named him Yaakov, [so it is not a sign]. @p1@p2And the following ten years he hoped and waited for her<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Why did Yitzchok wait until he was sixty before praying? Avraham waited only ten years, as Rashi explained in Parshas Lech Lecha (16:3), while Yitzchok waited twenty years. This is why Rashi explains as he does. And lest we say that from here we can learn that a husband who waits ten years [without children] should pray, not take another wife, Rashi explains: “He refused to marry a hand-maid because he was sanctified<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>..” It was not just a hand-maid [that Yitzchok did not take; it was any other wife]. @p1[27]@p2<TIE>As long as they were little<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: [Did not v. 23 teach us] that they were separated already from the womb, one to his wickedness and the other to his wholesomeness? Thus Rashi explains, “As long as they were little<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” I.e., even though Eisov was doing evil, people assumed it was due to childishness and did not recognize who he was until he turned thirteen. You might object: Eisov did not fall into bad ways until he was fifteen, which is why Avraham’s life was shortened by five years, as Rashi explains on v. 30. The answer is: During those two years [between thirteen and fifteen], Eisov was secretly wicked. Later, he did so publicly. @p1@p2Entrap and deceive his father with his mouth<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because it says @hb<HEB>יודע@hh ציד@ee<ENG>, implying that it requires wisdom. Otherwise it would mean the same as, “A man of the field.” Furthermore, [Rashi knows this] because @hh<HEB>איש ציד@ee<ENG> is the opposite of @hh<HEB>איש תם@ee<ENG>, just as @hh<HEB>איש שדה@ee<ENG> is the opposite of @hh<HEB>יושב אוהלים@ee<ENG>. And if @hh<HEB>איש ציד@ee<ENG> meant trapping animals, it would not be the opposite of @hh<HEB>איש תם@ee<ENG>. A wholesome man could also trap animals!<QC>
@p1@p2How is salt tithed<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Since these things need not be tithed even Rabbinically, [Eisov’s question implied that] he observed mitzvos meticulously. [You might ask:] Why does Rashi say that Eisov deceived Yitzckok [specifically] in the mitzvah of tithes? The answer is: Since it is written expressly that Avraham observed this mitzvah, as it says (14:20), “[Avram] gave him a tenth of everything,” it is certain that his descendants continued to keep this mitzvah. For it says so about Yitzchok (26:12): “A hundred-fold,” [which was for the purpose of tithing; see Rashi there]. And it says so about Yaakov (28:22): “I will surely give a tenth to You.” (@ITKitzur Mizrachi@it) @p1@p2Who uses his bow to hunt animals and birds@p3. It does not mean he worked in the fields, for then it should say: “Man of the soil,” as it did for Noach (9:20). Or it should say: “Worker of the soil,” as it did for Kayin (4:2).<QC>
@p1[29]@p2<TIE>As a result of committing murder<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Otherwise, it should say he was hungry. @p1[30]@p2<TIE>Red lentils<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because it is written here @hh<HEB>ויזד יעקב @hbנזיד@ee<ENG>, and in v. 34 it is written @hb<HEB>נזיד@hh עדשים@ee<ENG>. Just as there it is lentils, so too here it is lentils. And just as here they are red, as it is written, “Please give me a swallow of this @ITred@it,” so too there they are red. @p1@p2For this reason God shortened his life by five years<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 You might ask: Perhaps his time to die had arrived? The answer is: About Avraham it is written @hh<HEB>זקן ושבע@ee<ENG> (25:8), omitting the word @hh<HEB>ימים@ee<ENG>. Whereas about Yitzchok it says (35:29): @hh<HEB>זקן ושבע ימים@ee<ENG>, [connoting fullness of days,] and so is it said about other righteous men.<QC>
@p1[32]@p2<TIE>Said Eisov: “What is the nature of this Service?”@p3 If he said it due to hunger, he should have said, “I @ITam@it dying,” [rather than, “I am @ITgoing@it to die”].<QC>
@p1[34]@p2<TIE>Scripture testifies to his wickedness<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Meaning: we know he did not desire his birthright since it is written that he sold it to Yaakov. If so, why does Scripture need to write, “Eisov scorned the birthright”? Perforce, Scripture is testifying to his wickedness. In other words, we would anyway know that he was wicked, but here Scripture is testifying to it. We similarly explained the verse, “The daughter of Besueil, the Aramite, of Padan Aram” (v. 20).<QC>
@p1[2]@p2<TIE>For you are a burnt-offering without blemish and being outside the [Holy] Land does not befit you.@p3 I.e., a burnt-offering is a @ITkodshei kodoshim@it sacrifice and may not be taken outside the Temple Courtyard. Similarly, the Land of Israel is your “Temple Courtyard”; you may not go outside the Land.<QC>
@p1[4]@p2<TIE>A man will say to his son, “May your children be like the children of Yitzchok.”@p3 Rashi is explaining that the nations will receive oral blessings [from one another], not that they will become blessed because your children [are a source of blessing for them]. For then it should say @hh<HEB>והתברכו @hbמ@hhזרעך@ee<ENG>. @p1[5]@p2<TIE>To include the Oral Law — laws given by God to Moshe at Sinai.@p3 You might ask: Since they fulfilled the entire Torah, why did Yaakov marry two sisters, (and Shimon his sister Dinah), and Amram his aunt Yocheved? The answer is: They only accepted upon themselves to fulfill the mitzvos in the Land of Israel, but they were outside the Land [when these events occurred]. (@ITRamban@it) @p1[7]@p2<TIE>Concerning his wife@p3. [Rashi explains this] because [the word @hb<HEB>ל@hhאשתו@ee<ENG> in] the verse makes it sound as if they asked Rivkah, and Yitzchok answered. But this is not plausible. Perforce, [it means they asked him, @ITconcerning@it his wife].<QC>
@p1[8]@p2<TIE>He thought, “From now on I have no need to worry<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 The explanation of @hh<HEB>וישקף@ee<ENG> is that Yitzchok unconcernedly left open the place where people could look in. Consequently, “Avimelech looked.” @p1@p2He saw him having marital relations@p3. [Rashi knows this] because otherwise, how did Avimelech know she was his wife? But [Rashi’s proof] is not readily understood, as Avimelech could [have known this by just] seeing an embrace and a kiss. (@ITRe’m@it) [Another approach:] It seems that Rashi deduced this from the superfluous word @hh<HEB>אשתו@ee<ENG>, which implies that Yitzchok was amusing himself in a way pertaining to his wife, i.e., marital relations. [Another approach:] Rashi makes his comment on “Avimelech looked,” not on “Avimelech saw,” so we will not say that Avimelech actually saw him having marital relations. Heaven forbid that a tzaddik like Yitzchok would leave the window open! Rather, Yitzchok @ITclosed@it the window — and that led Avimelech to understand [that she was his wife]. “Avimelech @ITlooked@it” means he observed and understood. And the phrase @hh<HEB>בעד החלון@ee<ENG> [does not mean “through” the window. It] means “facing the window,” as this is the general meaning of @hh<HEB>בעד@ee<ENG> that appears in Scripture. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) See there for his proof against @ITRe’m@it.<QC>
@p1[10]@p2<TIE>The one singled out amongst the people, meaning, the king.@p3 Rashi knows this because it is written, “You would have brought guilt upon @ITus@it.” It is understandable if it refers to the king, as a king is referred to in the plural form, as is a prominent man. [Another approach:] It seems to me that Rashi knows this because otherwise it should say @hh<HEB>אֶחד@ee<ENG> rather than @hh<HEB>אַחד@ee<ENG>. And similarly Rashi explains the verse @hh<HEB>דן ידין עמו כאַחד@ee<ENG> (49:16). (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1@p2Had he had relations, you already would have brought guilt upon us.@p3 @hh<HEB>והבאת@ee<ENG> cannot be future tense because it says @hh<HEB>שכב@ee<ENG> which is [clearly] past tense. A further reason [it cannot be future tense]: Avimelech had them announce that she is Yitzchok’s wife [and that whoever touches her shall die]. As a result, no one would sleep with her. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1[12]@p2<TIE>Despite the fact that it is not as esteemed as Eretz Yisrael itself<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Is not Gerar also in Eretz Yisrael, as Rashi explained above (v. 2)?<QC>
@p1@p2They had estimated the amount it ought to produce<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 @hh<HEB>מאה שערים@ee<ENG> means @hh<HEB>מאה שיעורים@ee<ENG> (a hundred amounts), as they had estimated it (@hh<HEB>שערה@ee<ENG>). @p1@p2Our Sages said, the purpose of this estimate was for tithing.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Why did they measure [the produce after the initial estimate]? It is stated in Bava Metzia 42a that only something hidden from the eye is blessed, not something that is counted and measured! Thus Rashi explains that Yitzchok wanted to give tithes, and one may not give tithes based on a mere estimate (Avos 1:16). @p1[13]@p2<TIE>So that people would say: Rather the dung of Yitzchok’s mules<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Otherwise why does it say, “Until he became very great”? [The next verse details his wealth! Perforce,] it comes to tell us the extent [of his blessing]. Thus Rashi mentions mules, since mules [ordinarily] have no blessing at all, as Rashi explained in Devarim 15:14. @p1[15]@p2<TIE>Because they said, “They are a danger to us because the armies<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 But [the plugging was] not because of jealousy. For then Scripture should [connect the idea of their jealousy to their plugging, and] say: “And the Philistines were jealous of him. They plugged all the wells that his father’s servants had dug<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>..” (@ITRe’m@it) But it seems to me that they indeed plugged the wells because of jealousy, but to conceal their jealousy they mentioned the aspect of danger. Otherwise, “And the Philistines were jealous” should come right before, “Avimelech said to Yitzchok, ‘Go away from us.’” And afterward it should say, “All the wells<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.,” followed by, “Yitzchok returned and excavated the wells.” Why is, “All the wells<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” juxtaposed to, “And the Philistines were jealous”? To tell us that they plugged the wells because of jealousy! They thought Yitzchok would sense their jealousy, and leave [on his own]. When Avimelech saw that his plan failed, he told Yitzchok outright, “Go away from us.” (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1@p2@HB<HEB>טמונון פלשתאי@BO<ENG> meaning stopping up<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is telling us not to explain Onkelos along the lines of @hb<HEB>טמוני @hhחול@ee<ENG> (Devarim 33:19), denoting something hidden. That is why he explains that [this word] also means stopping up.<QC>
@p1[17]@p2<TIE>Far away from the city.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Avimelech told him, “Go away from us,” i.e., from Gerar. Why then did Yitzchok camp in the valley of Gerar, close to the city? @p1[18]@p2<TIE>Those wells that<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. in the days of his father Avraham<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the questions: Yitzchok already left, so how could he dig the wells, [which were in Gerar]? Furthermore, if Avraham already dug them, [and nothing happened in between, see next question,] why did Yitzchok dig them again? Also, why is it written: “And were plugged by the Philistines,” implying that the Philistines went and plugged them @ITafter@it Yitzchok dug them? Yet this is not so — nowhere does it say they plugged them after Yitzchok’s digging. Thus Rashi answers: “Which the Philistines had stopped up @ITbefore@it Yitzchok departed from Gerar, he again dug them [before departing].” The @ITNachalas Yaakov@it writes at length, and maintains that the text of Rashi should say: @hh<HEB>ופלשתים סתמום קודם שנסע יצחק מגרר חזר וחפרן@ee<ENG>. Written like this, it is evident that [before Yitzchok left, the Philistines stopped them up, and] @ITafter@it he left and camped in the valley of Gerar, far from the city, he then returned and dug the wells.<QC>
@p1[20]@p2<TIE>They disputed with him<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is telling us not to explain the word @hh<HEB>עשק@ee<ENG> as meaning “dispute.” Rather, it means an actual @hh<HEB>עסק@ee<ENG> (matter). I.e., it was a matter of dispute.<QC>
@p1[22]@p2<TIE>As Onkelos translates it: “And we @BIwill@BO increase in the land.”@p3 The word @hh<HEB>ופרינו@ee<ENG> cannot be past tense, because Yitzchok said: “For @ITnow@it, Adonoy has made room for us.” How could he then say they were @ITalready@it fruitful in the land? Perforce, it is future tense. Thus Rashi disagrees with our version of Onkelos which says @hh<HEB>ויפשיננא@ee<ENG>, past tense, and explains that the text of Onkelos should read: @hh<HEB>וניפוש@ee<ENG>.<QC>
@p1[28]@p2<TIE>That oath that exists between us since your father’s times.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Is not the phrase @hh<HEB>בינותינו בינינו וביניך@hh@ee<ENG> redundant? He answers that the phrases in this verse are not written in sequence. It should say @hh<HEB>תהי אלה בינותינו, @hbנא@hh ביני וביניך@hh@ee<ENG>. This means: let that oath, which already exists between us, continue now. Rashi adds a @hh<HEB>ה@hh@ee<ENG> to @hh<HEB>אלה@hh@ee<ENG>, and inserts @hh<HEB>אשר@hh@ee<ENG>, because it is recounting what happened to Avraham. And he inserts @hh<HEB>גם@hh@ee<ENG> because Avimelech is seeking to make the same covenant with Yitzchok that he made with Avraham. Thus he says @hh<HEB>גם עתה@hh@ee<ENG>. It is evident that Rashi, when he says @hh<HEB>עתה@hh@ee<ENG> (now), is explaining @hh<HEB>נא@hh@ee<ENG>. [Accordingly, @hh<HEB>נא@hh@ee<ENG> means “now,” rather than “please.”] @p1[29]@p2<TIE>You, also<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi inserts the word @hh<HEB>גם@ee<ENG> to indicate that the Torah’s word @hh<HEB>אתה@ee<ENG> means @hh<HEB>גם אתה@ee<ENG> (“You, also, do with us likewise”). This is the prevalent version of Rashi’s text. Accordingly, @hh<HEB>עתה ברוך ה'@ee<ENG> is an independent phrase, [not to be read together with the preceding word @hh<HEB>אתה@ee<ENG>,] and comes to explain what was stated above: Why are we asking this of you? Because @ITnow@it we have seen that you are the blessed one of Hashem. question: Is not the phrase @hh<HEB>בינותינו בינינו וביניך@ee<ENG> redundant? He answers that the phrases in this verse are not written in sequence. It should say @hh<HEB>תהי אלה בינותינו, @hbנא@hh ביני וביניך@ee<ENG>. This means, “Let that oath, which already exists between us, continue now.” Rashi adds a @hh<HEB>ה@ee<ENG> to @hh<HEB>אלה@ee<ENG>, and inserts @hh<HEB>אשר@ee<ENG>, because it is recounting what happened to Avraham. And he inserts @hh<HEB>גם@ee<ENG> because Avimelech is seeking to make the same covenant with Yitzchok that he made with Avraham. Thus he says @hh<HEB>גם עתה@ee<ENG>. It is evident that Rashi, when he says @hh<HEB>עתה@ee<ENG> (now), is explaining @hh<HEB>נא@ee<ENG>. [Accordingly, @hh<HEB>נא@ee<ENG> means “now,” rather than “please.”]<QC>
@p1[35]@p2<TIE>An expression meaning: a spirit of rebellion, as in: “You were rebellious.”@p3 For if it meant @hh<HEB>מרירות@ee<ENG> (bitterness), it would not have a @hh<HEB>ת@ee<ENG> in the construct state, since the root would be @hh<HEB>מרר@ee<ENG>. Whereas the root of @hh<HEB>ממרים@ee<ENG> is @hh<HEB>מרה@ee<ENG>, and the @hh<HEB>ת@ee<ENG> of the construct state replaces the @hh<HEB>ה@ee<ENG>, since it is the third letter of the root. @hh<HEB>מרת רוח@ee<ENG> conveys that each of Eisov’s wives possessed a rebellious spirit, whereas bitterness does not relate to one’s spirit. @p1@p2Because they worshiped idols@p3. It seems that Rashi deduced this since Scripture mentions Yitzchok before Rivkah, to say that the pain was greater for Yitzchok. [Perforce,] this was because all his life he was not accustomed to idol worship. But Rivkah was accustomed to her father’s and brother’s idolatry. @p1[1]@p2<TIE>Because of the smoke of these.@p3 This follows its simple meaning: smoke is bad for the eyes. But Rivkah was used to it, as explained in the previous entry. It seems to me that all three reasons are needed, as follows. First Rashi explains that Yitzchok’s blindness was from the smoke, as Scripture juxtaposed it right afterward. But this raises the question: Why did Hashem bring this misfortune on him? [Rashi answers:] Perforce, Hashem did not save him from this cause [of blindness] so that Yaakov could receive the blessing. But a question remains: In any case, if there was smoke, why did not Rivkah, too, become blind? Thus Rashi explains that Yitzchok’s eyes were already weakened from the @ITakeidah@it, and the smoke caused him to lose his sight altogether. (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1[3]@p2<TIE>Sharpen your knife and slaughter properly<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Meaning: there should not be a nick in the knife. @ITRe’m@it asks: Granted that Yitzchok relied on Eisov, as he held him to be a good person. Nevertheless, since Eisov slaughtered birds in flight [with his bow], why was Yitzchok not concerned that the slaughter would be invalid because of @ITchaladah@it [when the @ITsimonim@it — windpipe or esophagus — are cut under the cover of the feathers or skin]? @ITRe’m@it answers as in Chulin 31a, [that the feathers around the neck were cut; see there]. But @ITRe’m’s@it discussion is unnecessary, as Yitzchok never asked Eisov to bring fowl, only animals [such as deer]. This is as Rashi explains in v. 9: “The taste of kid is similar to the taste of deer.” Although our verse mentions the bow, which implies that Eisov was asked to shoot arrows at birds, however, the bow could be used for animals: he could shoot the animal so it cannot flee, but in a manner that does not render it a @ITtreifah@it, and then he would slaughter it with a sword. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1@p2From the ownerless and not from the robbed@p3. Otherwise, why does it say, “For me,” when it is written (v. 4), “Bring it to me”? Thus Rashi explains: “From ownerless<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>..”<QC>
@p1[7]@p2<TIE>With His consent<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Question: How could Rivkah say, “In the presence of Hashem,” something which Yitzchok never said? The answer is that Rashi had a question: If Yitzchok considered Eisov righteous, why did he warn him so much on this day about @ITneveilah@it and robbery? Rashi, [by explaining, “With His consent,”] answers that Yitzchok intended the blessings to be with Hashem’s consent — that He should grant His approval. This is why Yitzchok especially exhorted Eisov on this day. [And when Rivkah heard his exhortation, she understood that Yitzchok intended to bless Eisov “in the presence of Hashem.”] Rivkah said [to herself] about this: Since Eisov is going to bring any animal, even a stolen one [see Rashi on v. 5], he also will not obey his father regarding @ITneveilah@it. If so, Hashem surely will not grant His approval. Thus she told Yaakov (v. 9, see Rashi there): “Take for me from there,” i.e., they are not stolen ones. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it)<QC>
@p1[9]@p2<TIE>One .<TIE>.<TIE>. his Paschal offering and one .<TIE>.<TIE>. as delicious food<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 You might ask: How does Rashi know it was Pesach? It seems the answer is: Yitzchok was born on Pesach, as Rashi explains in Parshas Vayeira (18:10). And Hashem completes the days of the righteous — they die on the same day they were born. This is as it says about Moshe (Devarim 31:2): “Today I am one hundred and twenty years old,” and Rashi explains: “Today, my days became complete. On this day I was born, and on this day I will die.” Since Yitzchok said (v. 2), “I do not know the day of my death,” i.e., perhaps I will die today, it must have been Pesach. (@ITMaharshal@it)<QC>
@p1[15]@p2<TIE>The ones he coveted from Nimrod.@p3 Meaning: These garments bore pictures of all kinds of animals, and when Nimrod would wear them and go out to the field, the animals would think the pictures were animals, and would approach him. Eisov killed Nimrod and took the garments.<QC>
@p1[19]@p2<TIE>I am the one who brings you, and Eisov is your first-born.@p3 Otherwise, Yaakov lied. You might object: He still lied, for Eisov had sold him the birthright. How could he say, “Eisov is your first-born”? The answer is: Yaakov bought only the rights, i.e., the sacrificial service entitled by the birthright, not the birthright itself. Eisov remained the first-born for the double inheritance. Another answer: Eisov was indeed the one born first [although he sold the accompanying rights].<QC>
@p1[21]@p2<TIE>It is unusual for Eisov to readily mention God’s Name<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 You might ask: Did not Yitzchok consider Eisov completely righteous? The answer is: For the very reason that he was completely righteous, he would not mention Hashem’s Name needlessly! [You might object:] This surely should be true of Yaakov, and Yitzchok considered him more righteous than Eisov, as explained above. [The answer is:] Yitzchok reasoned that Eisov cannot avoid filthy places, thus he is more careful than Yaakov about mentioning Hashem’s Name. For Yaakov dwelled in tents [of Torah study] and did not enter filthy places. @p1[22]@p2<TIE>He spoke gently and entreatingly<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because if it follows its simple meaning, i.e., Yitzchok recognized his voice, then Yitzchok immediately should have commented when hearing him say, “It is I, Eisov your first-born.” Furthermore, when Yaakov said to his mother, “Suppose my father touches me” (v. 12), why was he not worried [also] about being recognized by voice? Perforce, their voices were similar, and this is why Rashi explains “the voice of Yaakov” as speaking entreatingly. @p1@p2Spoke stridently<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Although Yitzchok considered Eisov completely righteous, this does not show Eisov’s wickedness. There are many people who speak stridently although they are good people.<QC>
@p1[27]@p2<TIE>This teaches that the smell of the Garden of Eden entered with him.@p3 This is because Eisov coveted these garments [and took them] from Nimrod, who inherited them from Adam, who wore them in the Garden of Eden. @p1@p2Which is that of an apple-orchard@p3. “Blessed by Hashem” refers to “field”, as if saying: Like the fragrance of a field to which Hashem has given a pleasant scent, i.e., an apple-orchard. @p1[28]@p2<TIE>May he give repeatedly@p3. Rashi is answering the question: Why is it written @hb<HEB>ו@hhיתן@ee<ENG>, with a @hh<HEB>ו@ee<ENG>? Perforce, it means as follows: He will give to you — @ITand@it even if sins cause the blessing to cease, He will give again. This explanation follows the Midrash. But according to the simple meaning, the @hh<HEB>ו@ee<ENG> connects it to what preceded, saying: Hashem gave you one blessing; may He give you another. And where did Hashem bless Yaakov before? The answer is: It is written (v. 27), “Blessed by Hashem.” Here, Hashem blessed Yaakov, as this phrase refers back to, “My son,” written earlier in the verse. It is as if saying: “See that the fragrance of my son, whom Hashem has blessed, is like the fragrance of a field to which Hashem gave a pleasant fragrance.” @p1[29]@p2<TIE>Whereas here that he married only one woman he says, “Your mother’s sons.”@p3 [Yitzchok said it in this manner] because he did not want to say that his sons will be slaves, relating the curse to himself. (@ITGur Aryeh@it)<QC>
@p1@p2Regarding Bilam it states, “Those who bless you<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. and those who curse you<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”@p3 Meaning: Concerning the righteous, the troubles come first. Thus Yitzchok mentioned the curses of the cursers first. The Ramban asks: Why is it written in Lech Lecha (12:3), “I will bless those who bless you, and he who curses you, I will curse”? He answers: Because it is written afterward, “And through you, will be blessed<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Thus, the curses of the cursers indeed precede the blessings of those who bless. Although Bilam said to B’nei Yisrael, “Those who bless you are blessed,” he spoke as he did because he was accustomed to addressing the wicked. Alternatively, he blessed them with the reward of the wicked: B’nei Yisrael too, should have tranquility at the beginning. @p1[30]@p2<TIE>As one went out the other came in@p3. Otherwise, why does it repeat: @hh<HEB>יָצֹא יָצָא@ee<ENG>? Perforce, Yaakov @ITleft@it his father’s tent while Eisov @ITleft@it the field and came to the house. But @ITRe’m@it explains that [Rashi knows this because] @hh<HEB>אך@ee<ENG> diminishes the leaving. [I.e., before Yaakov finished leaving, Eisov had come]. @p1[33]@p2<TIE>As Onkelos translates it @HB<HEB>ותוה@ee@BO<ENG>, meaning surprise. But its Midrashic<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 According to the Midrash, @hh<HEB>ויחרד@ee<ENG> means fear of the opening of Gehinom. It does not mean what it sounds like, i.e., surprise. Yet even according to the simple meaning, the word @hh<HEB>ויחרד@ee<ENG> denotes “fear” and not “surprise.” Rather, Rashi is explaining that [according to the simple meaning,] the fear came from the surprise of, “Who, then, is he?” as the verse sounds like it is saying. Whereas according to the Midrash, the fear was of Gehinom. @p1@p2He saw Gehinom open beneath him.@p3 It means beneath Eisov, [not beneath Yitzchok]. Yaakov entered accompanied by the Garden of Eden, and Eisov was accompanied by Gehinom. (@ITGur Aryeh@it) @p1@p2An independent word, used with many situations<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., it is not [always] a compound word from @hh<HEB>איה@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>פה@ee<ENG>. Rather, it [often] is a word on its own and has various meanings depending on its context.<QC>
@p1@p2Any taste that I wished to taste<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Otherwise, why does it say @hh<HEB>מכל@ee<ENG>? @p1@p2So you may not say: had Yaakov not tricked his father<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Question: [If so, why] was “He has deceived me” (v. 36) written after “He shall be blessed”? It seems the answer is: Eisov surely wailed immediately, “What has this brother done to me? He has deceived me twice!” Upon hearing this, his father said, “He shall be blessed.” When Eisov heard his father respond, “He shall be blessed,” to the claim of, “He has deceived me twice,” paying him no heed, Eisov exclaimed (ibid): “Is he not rightly called Yaakov?” I.e., I see that you like his deceit and trickery, and that is why you named him @hh<HEB>יעקב@ee<ENG> [“He will deceive”], in the future tense, rather than @hh<HEB>עקב@ee<ENG> [“he held the heel”] — because he would deceive me twice! (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1@p2Therefore he affirmed it and knowingly blessed him@p3. Otherwise, why does it say, “He shall be blessed”? He had already blessed him!<QC>
@p1[35]@p2<TIE>With cleverness@p3. Otherwise, [if it meant deceit], why should he be blessed? @p1[36]@p2<TIE>As in “Is it because you are my relative?”@p3 From what was said after “You shall work for me without pay,” it is clear [that it was an incredulous question,] and Lavan was not actually requesting this. For Lavan said right after: “Tell me, what should your wages be?”<QC>
@p1[39]@p2<TIE>This refers to the part of Italy belonging to Greece@p3. It was previously stated (v. 28), “Of the dew of heaven and of the @ITfatness of the land@it,” referring to the @ITfruit@it of the land. I.e., the grain and produce of your land should be rich and good. But here it refers to the place. I.e., that it should be located in the richness of the earth. Thus, here it says, “Your dwelling,” meaning the @ITplace@it he dwells in. Otherwise, [if it meant rich produce,] the question arises: Yitzchok had already given to Yaakov the blessing of the fatness of the land. [How then could Yitzchok now give it to Eisov?] @p1[40]@p2<TIE>And you will have reason to grieve over the blessings<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 You might object: It does not say anywhere that Yitzchok placed conditions on his blessings to Yaakov. The answer is: It is written, “And may @hh<HEB>האלהים@ee<ENG> give you” (v. 28). The word @hh<HEB>האלהים@ee<ENG> implies justice: “If you deserve it, ‘He will give to you.’” (@ITR. Noson@it)<QC>
@p1[41]@p2<TIE>So that I will not grieve my father<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Although he was wicked, he would never grieve his father. He treated his father with honor, as proved by (28:8): “Eisov realized that the daughters of Canaan were evil in the eyes of Yitzchok, his father<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”<QC>
@p1[42]@p2<TIE>The meaning of consolation<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 You might ask: Does it not mean consolation according to the Midrash as well? The answer is: Rashi is saying that if we explain it as the Midrash does, meaning consolation — rather than as regret — then the verse can be explained [quite simply]: Eisov will comfort and console himself over losing the blessings by killing you. Thus, we need not explain it as referring to the cup of consolation.<QC>
@p1[2]@p2<TIE>Any word that requires a @HB<HEB>ל@ee@BO<ENG> prefix<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 It does not mean just any word, as we find this rule applies only to names of places and countries, such as @hh<HEB>בבלה@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>חברונה@ee<ENG>, and sometimes to vessels, such as @hh<HEB>המזבחה@ee<ENG>. @p1[3]@p2<TIE>He who has sufficient blessings<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Otherwise, why is this particular Name of Hashem mentioned here?<QC>
@p1[4]@p2<TIE>May that nation descend from you as well as that blessed seed.@p3 Otherwise, [if it simply meant that Yaakov should be blessed as Avraham was,] it should say @hh<HEB>ויתן לך ברכת אברהם@ee<ENG>. But @hh<HEB>את@hh ברכת אברהם@ee<ENG> implies taking Avraham’s blessing and bequeathing it to Yaakov. Why does Rashi not relate @hh<HEB>ברכת אברהם@ee<ENG> to inheriting the Land, saying that Yaakov, over and above Yitzchok’s other sons, should receive the Land? Because inheriting the Land is a gift, not a blessing. (@ITRe’m@it) @p1[5]@p2<TIE>I do not know what this teaches us.@p3 Some ask: What is Rashi telling us — that he does not know? If he does not know, let him not comment! The answer is: Rashi knew a number of answers that could be given, but did not know which is true according to the simple meaning of Scripture. (@ITKitzur Mizrachi@it; see @ITTzeidah L’Derech@it)<QC>
@p1[9]@p2<TIE>We learn from this that he hid in the house of Eiver for fourteen years and afterwards went to Charan.@p3 Question: Why does Rashi here mention [only] Eiver, while when explaining the verse “She went to inquire of Hashem” (25:22), he mentions [only] Sheim, and when explaining the words “They clashed” (ibid), he mentions [both] Sheim @ITand@it Eiver? The answer is: “They clashed” is a blanket statement. When she would pass houses of Torah study, Yaakov would agitate and rush to come out. Sheim and Eiver had different study halls, as it is written (25:27): “Yaakov was a man without fault, dwelling in tents,” [in the plural form. See Rashi there.] Assumedly, Scripture means that Yaakov agitated by both tents. But regarding “She went to inquire of Hashem,” Rivkah went to [only] one of them, and surely she went to Sheim, since he was the grandfather of Eiver, and greater than him. While here, Rashi mentions only Eiver because, by this time, Sheim had already died.<QC>
@p1[10]@p2<TIE>When it finished it went back to the previous subject.@p3 I.e., Rashi’s original question was: Why does Scripture need to repeat the point and write, “Yaakov left,” when it had already written (28:5), “Yitzchok sent Yaakov on his way”? Rashi answers: Since the narrative of Yaakov was interrupted by the subject of Eisov—and proceeds to explain why it was interrupted: since [Yitzchok sent Yaakov away,] Eisov understood that Yitzchok considered the daughters of Canaan evil, so Eisov went to Yishmael. After explaining why the narrative was interrupted, Rashi goes back to complete his explanation of why Scripture repeats the point: “When it finished<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (@ITKitzur Mizrachi,@it see there) @p1@p2It had only to be written: “And Yaakov went to Charan<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”@p3 [Rashi knows this] because it is written in another place, “Yaakov<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. went to Paddan Aram” (28:5), without writing beforehand, “Yaakov left.” Perforce, if he went to Paddan Aram, he left Beer Sheva! Here too, Scripture should have written only, “Yaakov went.” @p1@p2This tells us that the departure<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. makes an impression<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi is answering the question:] Why did Scripture write two departures, so to speak? It says, “Yaakov left,” and also, “He went towards Charan,” [which itself implies that he left.] Perforce [the answer is]: One teaches that his person departed, and the other teaches that the brilliance, splendor and glory departed. (@ITRe’m@it) @ITMaharshal@it comments on this: @ITRe’m’s@it explanation differs from Bereishis Rabboh (68:7), which says: It is written @hh<HEB>ויצא@ee<ENG> (singular), and not @hh<HEB>ויצאו@ee<ENG>. But did not also camels and other animals leave with him? Perforce, it teaches: “Its brilliance has departed<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>..” [@ITMaharshal@it continues:] It seems that we need both the explanation of @ITRe’m@it and of Bereishis Rabboh, as follows: Since it is written “Yaakov left” and also “He went,” it is appears to be redundant. Perforce, it comes to say that @IThe@it left and not another. This raises a question: Did not also camels leave with him? Perforce, [it speaks specifically of him] because when Yaakov left, the glory and brilliance departed—which would not be so if someone else had left. @p1@p2While a righteous person is in the city, he is its glory<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., when a tzaddik is in the city, the men and people are also righteous because they are ashamed of him [and do not sin]. Also, because he reproves them. @p1@p2Once he has left there, its glory has departed<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., the people of the city commit sins. We need not object that Yitzchok was still there, as Bereishis Rabboh already answered: The righteousness of one tzaddik is not like the righteousness of two tzaddikim. @p1@p2“And she left the place,” which is written concerning Naomi and Ruth.@p3 Question: Why does Rashi bring a proof from Ruth, when in Ruth, he brings a proof from here? The answer is: Without the proof from Ruth, we might think that the two leavings written here are (1) the departure of his person and (2) the departure of his money, flock and cattle which left with him. Thus, Rashi brings proof from Ruth that the departure of a tzaddik makes an impression—as there, it cannot refer to the departure of their property. For it is written there that she said (Ruth 1:21), “Hashem has brought me back empty,” indicating clearly that she had no property. And in Ruth, Rashi brings a proof from here, because we might think that it makes an impression only if no tzaddik remains behind, as was the case there. But where there are tzaddikim, how do we know that the departure of a tzaddik makes an impression? Thus Rashi proves it from here, as Yitzchok and Rivkah remained, yet Yaakov’s departure still made an impression. (See @ITTzeidah L’Derech@it, who offers a lengthy explanation.) @p1@p2He left in order to go to Charan@p3. Rashi is answering the question: @hh<HEB>וילך חרנה@ee<ENG> seems to imply that he came to Charan. But how can this be? It is written after the verse, “He reached the place [of Mt. Moriah],” which occurred @ITbefore@it he came to Charan! It is difficult to say that @hh<HEB>וילך@ee<ENG> means what it sounds like, that he got to Charan, and then Scripture goes back to explain the place he reached while traveling—this is not the norm of Scripture. Thus Rashi explains: “He left @ITin order to go@it to Charan” [but he did not get there yet]. @p1[11]@p2<TIE>Scripture does not identify which place<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: The verse is written to explain, not to be indefinite. Why then does it not specify the place? Thus Rashi explains: “It refers to @ITthe place@it mentioned elsewhere.” @p1@p2As in, “And it reached Jericho”<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 There it means to come to rest, not to meet. @p1@p2The Sages explained it as a term for prayer<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Accordingly, @hh<HEB>במקום@ee<ENG> means “to Hashem,” Who is called @hh<HEB>מקום@ee<ENG> (“Place”) since He is the world’s place. (@ITRe’m@it) @p1@p2Scripture used an alternate word and did not write @HB<HEB>ויתפלל@ee@BO<ENG> to teach you<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. [@boRashi is answering the question:] In the verse @hh<HEB>אל תפגע בי@ee<ENG>, it is understandable [that it says @hh<HEB>תפגע@ee<ENG>], as it conveys: do not come to Me to entreat. But for [Yaakov praying to] Hashem, this meaning does not fit, so why does Scripture use the alternate word? [Rashi answers:] Perforce, because @hh<HEB>פגיעה@ee<ENG> also means to meet, thus teaching that the earth shrank [and Yaakov “met” Mount Moriah which came toward him]. But if our verse would have said @hh<HEB>ויפגוש@ee<ENG> [the usual word for “meet”], we would not have learned anything about prayer. Therefore the verse writes @hh<HEB>ויפגע@ee<ENG>, which conveys both meanings. (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1@p2It should have said “And the sun set” and he “spent the night there”<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Although there is no difference [in meaning] between @hh<HEB>ויבא השמש וילן שם@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>וילן שם כי בא השמש@ee<ENG>, [Rashi is saying that] it should have been in [chronological] order, as in (Shoftim 19:9) it is written: “Behold, now the sun has waned and it is setting. Please remain overnight.” Perforce, our verse conveys that the sun set suddenly. A further explanation: It is written, “He spent the night there @ITbecause@it the sun set,” implying that otherwise he would have traveled on. This proves there still was much daytime left. If so, why did the sun set [early]? Perforce, “The sun set<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. so that he should stay @ITthere@it overnight.” This is Rashi’s explanation in Sanhedrin 91b. @p1@p2He made them in the form of a drainpipe around his head<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Otherwise it should say, “He took a stone.” @p1@p2They began to argue with one another<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because otherwise, the verses contradict one another. Here it is written, “He took some of the stones of that place,” i.e., many stones. But then it is written (v. 18), “And he took @ITthe stone@it.” Perforce, at first there were many stones, but “they began to argue<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>..” You might ask: How does Rashi know he took many stones? Perhaps he took one stone from among (@hh<HEB>מאבני@ee<ENG>) the stones of that place, and that is why it is written later, “And he took @ITthe stone@it.” Tosafos answer this in Chulin 91b: then Scripture should have written @hh<HEB>ויקח אבן@ee<ENG>, as in (Shemos 17:12) @hh<HEB>ויקחו אבן וישימו תחתיו @ee<ENG>. This is because our verse is written to explain, not to be indefinite. Perforce, since it is written @hh<HEB>מאבני@ee<ENG> without further explanation, it means [he took] many stones. @p1[12]@p2<TIE>It states @HB<HEB>עולים@ee@BO<ENG> first and @HB<HEB>יורדים@ee@BO<ENG> afterwards<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. @boRashi is answering the question: Why does it not say “descending” first, since the angels dwell in heaven? @p1[13]@p2<TIE>To guard him@p3. [Rashi knows this] because otherwise, what does @hh<HEB>נצב עליו@ee<ENG> mean? [“Above the ladder.” But this cannot be, as] the whole world is filled with His Glory! Perforce, it refers to [guard] Yaakov. You might ask: Why did Hashem need to guard him now, and not before? The answer is: Yaakov’s image is inscribed on the Throne of Glory. The angels now saw Yaakov and realized that it was his image [inscribed on the Throne]. They were jealous of him, as he was closer to the Throne than they were, and wanted to harm him. Thus, Hashem protected him. Another answer: The angels of the Land were ascending, and the angels of outside the Land, descending. In between [the changing of the guard], while no angels were with him, Hashem guarded him. (@ITRe’m@it) @p1@p2Hashem folded the entire Eretz Yisrael beneath him<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Otherwise, what was so great about giving him the land he was lying on, which was just four cubits? Thus Rashi explains, “Hashem folded<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Question: @ITWhy@it did Hashem fold it beneath him? The answer is: To make the whole land as easy to conquer as the four cubits he was lying on, as all of Eretz Yisrael was included in it. This is similar to (Melachim II 13:17): “And Elisha said, ‘Shoot!’ And he shot. And he said, ‘This is an arrow of salvation from Hashem<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>..’” @p1[14]@p2<TIE>“You will become strong,” as in @HB<HEB>וכן יפרוץ@BO<ENG>.@p3 The meaning is not as in @hh<HEB>פן @hbיפרץ@hh בם@ee<ENG> (Shemos 19:25), where it means destruction. @p1[15]@p2<TIE>Because he feared both Eisov and Lavan.@p3 Otherwise, why does it say, “I am with you,” which implies, “I will protect you”? Yaakov was afraid on his way there, lest Eisov pursue him, and on his way back, lest Lavan do so, as it actually happened. That is why the verse continues, “I will guard you wherever you @ITgo@it, and I will bring you @ITback@it.” (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @hh<HEB>אם@ee@p1@p2<ENG>, here, is used in the sense of @HB<HEB>כי@BO<ENG>. @boRashi is answering the question: “I will not forsake you until” implies He @ITsurely@it will not forsake him until then. So why does it say @hh<HEB>אם@ee<ENG>, which implies uncertainty? Thus Rashi explains that @hh<HEB>אם@ee<ENG> means @hh<HEB>כי@ee<ENG>, which conveys certainty. Rashi is saying that since @hh<HEB>כי@ee<ENG> can mean @hh<HEB>אם@ee<ENG>, it follows that @hh<HEB>אם@ee<ENG> can mean @hh<HEB>כי@ee<ENG>. @p1@p2For He had not spoken to Yaakov prior to this.@p3 You might ask: Perhaps @hh<HEB>אשר דברתי לך@ee<ENG> refers to what He just spoke to Yaakov: “I am Hashem<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (v. 13)? The answer is: If it referred to what He just spoke, it should have said @hh<HEB>כל אשר אני מְדַבֵר עמך@ee<ENG>, rather than @hh<HEB>דִבַרְתִי@ee<ENG> which is past tense. This is because it is one prophecy, and everything was in one dream; Yaakov did not wake up in between. @p1[16]@p2<TIE>For had I known I would not have slept<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: What difference does it make that he did not know? @p1[17]@p2<TIE>This ladder stood in Beer Sheva<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Yaakov said, “This is<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. @hh<HEB>בית אלהים@ee<ENG>,” implying he was in Beis Eil, as it is written later (v. 19): “He named that place Beis Eil.” This indicates that the ladder stood in Beis Eil. Yet, Scripture implied before that the ladder stood in Beer Sheva. For it is written (v. 12), “He dreamed, and behold, a ladder was set up on the earth.” And since it does not state the location of the ladder, we interpret it as referring to the place mentioned just before, which is Beer Sheva. If so, the verses appear to be contradictory. Thus Rashi explains that the ladder was standing in Beer Sheva, as Scripture implies, and the middle of its slope reached opposite the Beis Hamikdosh, which is Yerushalayim. And its top was in Beis Eil, as the verse also implies. It cannot be that the top of its slope is opposite the Beis Hamikdosh, for then Yaakov would be outside of the ladder. This is because Beer Sheva is in southern Yehudah, while the Beis Hamikdosh is in its north. If so, by what merit would Luz, [far away in northern Binyamin,] be called the House of God and the gate of Heaven? Neither the foot nor the top of the ladder is there! Thus Rashi explains that the middle of its slope is opposite the Beis Hamikdosh, and the top of the ladder is opposite Beis Eil, which is Luz. @ITMaharshal@it writes: It seems to me that the verse and Rashi’s commentary on it mean as follows. Rashi says, “Our Sages have stated<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. ‘This righteous person has come to My Dwelling Place.’” [Rashi is saying that this raises the question:] Hashem’s “Dwelling Place” is Yerushalayim. Yet, Scripture implies here that Yaakov slept in Beis Eil, [not in Yerushalayim! Rashi continues:] “And they stated furthermore: ‘Yaakov called Yerushalayim, Beis Eil.’” [Rashi says that this raises the question:] “Yet, this place that he called Beis Eil was Luz, not Yerushalayim!” [Rashi knows this] because it is written (v. 19), “But Luz was the original name of the city.” And even if we answer it all by saying that Luz @ITis@it Yerushalayim, [Rashi continues that] a question remains: “From where did they derive that [this was the site of the Beis Hamikdosh, and it is all the same place?” Rashi then rejects the idea that Beis Eil is Yerushalayim, and explains:] “I say that Mount Moriah was uprooted and came here, [to Beis Eil].” Accordingly, Yaakov gave the name of “Beis Eil” to both places at once: to Luz, which was the original name of the city, and to Yerushalayim, which came there. This properly explains the statements of our Sages [quoted by Rashi]. This explanation opposes the approach of @ITRe’m@it, [who writes that Rashi is answering two questions: 1.<TIE>Perhaps Luz is Yerushalayim? 2.<TIE>How did our Sages @ITknow@it Luz that is not Yerushalayim?] In our text of Rashi it is written that Yaakov called Yerushalayim, “Beis Eil,” but according to @ITRe’m,@it this is not needed. Furthermore, @ITRe’m@it says that the phrase, “Yet this place was Luz and not Yerushalayim,” is part of the Sages’ statement—but we do not find it written anywhere. Furthermore, even according to Rashi’s answer [that the ground “shrank”] the question would remain: Perhaps Luz really is Yerushalayim, and when Yaakov reached half way there, it came to him. It is without doubt that Rashi was always certain that Yerushalayim is not Luz. This is evident from the verses, as I explained. @p1@p2Should you ask: When Yaakov passed the Beis Hamikdosh why did He not detain him there?@p3 This is a quote from the Gemara, and is posing a question: Why did Hashem not detain him? The Gemara answers: “If it did not enter his mind<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. should Heaven detain him?” I.e., since Yaakov did not pray of his own accord, why should Hashem detain him? Hashem does not force a person to perform a mitzvah. @p1@p2The Targum translates it: How @HB<HEB>דחילו@ee@BO<ENG> is this place<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. @boRashi is proving that the word @hh<HEB>דחיל@hbו@ee<ENG>, which is Onkelos’ translation of @hh<HEB>נורא@ee<ENG>, [is a noun. It means “awesome.” Despite the @hh<HEB>ו@ee<ENG>, it] is not a plural [verb]. Rather, it is Onkelos’ way [to add a @hh<HEB>ו@ee<ENG>], such as with the noun @hh<HEB>תבונה@ee<ENG> (understanding), which Onkelos translates as @hh<HEB>סוכלתנ@ee@hhו@ee<ENG>. And so he translates the noun @hh<HEB>בגד@ee<ENG> (garment) as @hh<HEB>וכס@ee@hhו@ee<ENG>. This shows that it is usual for Onkelos to do so. @p1@p2Its Midrashic .<TIE>.<TIE>. the Heavenly Beis Hamikdosh is situated directly<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 It seems that the Midrash is not disagreeing. It is explaining @ITwhy@it this is the place where prayers ascend: because it is right below the Heavenly Beis Hamikdosh. Nonetheless, “the gate of heaven” is allegorical; heaven has no gate or window. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1[20]@p2<TIE>If He will keep these promises that He promised me<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Is not the verse repetitive? It is written @hh<HEB>אם יהיה אלקים עמדי@ee<ENG>, which is the same as @hh<HEB>ושמרני@ee<ENG>. Thus he explains that @hh<HEB>אם יהיה אלקים עמדי@ee<ENG> refers to keeping the promises. You might ask: How could Yaakov Avinu have been in doubt whether Hashem would keep His promise? The answer is: Yaakov was afraid his sins might cause Hashem not to guard him. Another answer: Yaakov thought the promise might be a [mere prophetic] dream, and every dream includes some nonsense (Berachos 55a). Therefore he said, “If He will keep these promises<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” You might ask: Since Rashi is showing where the promises are written, where did Hashem promise Yaakov “clothing to wear”? The answer is: If Yaakov was promised bread, surely he was promised clothing. For @ITChazal@it say (Bava Metzia 52a): “Exploit for your back, but only its worth for your belly.” This means: exploit (i.e., misuse) your money to buy overpriced clothing [if necessary]. “But only its worth for your belly.” For your stomach, do not pay more [for food] than it is worth. It also says in Chulin 84b: “A person should always eat below his means, but dress above his means.” So if Hashem promised him food, surely He promised him clothing as well. Otherwise, Yaakov would have to cut down on food in order to buy clothing, and would not have [sufficient] food to eat — yet, Hashem promised him [sufficient] food! (@ITMahara’i@it) @p1[21]@p2<TIE>Completely free from sin<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 This too was part of Hashem’s promises. He said (v. 15), “<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.Until I have done what I spoke to you,” on which Rashi explains: “In your interest and concerning you.” And if Yaakov would not be free of sin, but would learn from Lavan, then Hashem’s promises surely would not be fulfilled. For all Hashem’s promises are on condition that sin should not cause [their nonfulfillment]. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1[22]@p2<TIE>As it is translated <TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. And he, indeed, did so upon his return<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi says, “And he indeed did so<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” so that we will not ask: How does Onkelos know that “become a House of God” means specifically that Yaakov will serve@IT@it Hashem on this monument, [i.e., will bring offerings on it?] Rashi answers: We see that Yaakov brought offerings in the end. Evidently, this was his intention from the beginning. The phrase, “And Hashem will be my God” (v. 21), is part of the condition [that Yaakov set for his vow,] not part of [his promise in] the vow. Therefore Onkelos says here, “I shall serve Hashem @ITupon it@it,” implying: Even if Hashem does not keep His promise, I surely will bring offerings to Him—but not on @ITthis@it altar. You might object: It says @hb<HEB>ו@hhכל אשר תתן לי עשר אעשרנו לך@ee<ENG>, implying: “And if You do not keep the promise, I will not give You a tenth.” The answer is: [The @hh<HEB>ו@ee<ENG> of @hh<HEB>וכל@ee<ENG> denotes “but”. Accordingly,] this phrase means: “But of all that You give, I will surely give a tenth to You, even if You do not keep the promise.” However, the @ITMaharshal@it writes: It seems that Yaakov was saying as follows: “If You keep the promise—@hh<HEB>עשר אעשרנו@ee<ENG>, I will give two tenths. And if not, I will give one tenth.” And so he did. @p1[2]@p2<TIE>The shepherds give the flocks to drink<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Meaning: They would give them to drink [regularly]. Similarly with @hh<HEB>ונאספו@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>וגללו@ee<ENG> [in the next verse]; the future tense is used in place of the present tense, to convey that they would regularly gather and roll the stone. @p1[3]@p2<TIE>Because the stone was large@p3. Rashi is explaining [how the phrases fit together, as logically they should be ordered differently.] When it said, “There were three flocks of sheep lying beside it,” it should have immediately explained @ITwhy@it they were lying there, and say it was because “all the flocks would gather.” [And why would they gather? Because “there was a large stone.”] Therefore Rashi says on our verse, “Because<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” He is explaining how, “There was a large stone over the mouth of the well,” [fits in with the other phrases]. @p1@p2Every expression in the present tense<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. in the future tense as well as in the past <TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Why did Rashi not explain this before, on @hh<HEB>ישקו העדרים@ee<ENG> — “The shepherds give (@hh<HEB>משקים@ee<ENG>) the flocks to drink”? Furthermore, why did Rashi not bring the Targum there? [The answer is:] Here it is written @hh<HEB>וגללו@ee<ENG> (past tense) and the Targum is @hh<HEB>מגנדרין@ee<ENG>, present tense—while in v. 8, again it is written @hh<HEB>וגללו@ee<ENG>, and the Targum there is @hh<HEB>ויגנדרון@ee<ENG>, future tense! The [varying] Targum clearly shows that the verses are speaking in present tense. But the Targum of @hh<HEB>ישקו@ee<ENG> does not show this, as the word is not repeated. Before, it is written @hh<HEB>ישקו@ee<ENG>, and here it is written @hh<HEB>והשקינו@ee<ENG>. And so too all the other words are all different, except for @hh<HEB>וגללו@ee<ENG>. @p1[7]@p2<TIE>Nevertheless, it is not yet time for the sheep to be gathered.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Is not this point expressed backwards? Once Yaakov said, “The day is yet long,” Scripture does not need to write, “It is not yet time for the sheep to be gathered,” as it is obvious! Thus Rashi explains that Yaakov is making two points. @p1[8]@p2<TIE>To give them drink because the stone is large@p3. Rashi is explaining that they cannot roll it due to its weight, as Rashi said on v. 3, and not because they had so agreed among themselves. @p1[10]@p2<TIE>As one removes a @HB<HEB>פקק@ee@BO<ENG> from a bottle opening<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 This means a cover from a bottle. Rashi is saying that Yaakov did not roll the stone [with difficullty] as the shepherds did, but [he removed it] with ease. Rashi deduced this because it is written @hh<HEB>ויגל@ee<ENG>, “he revealed,” and not @hh<HEB>ויגלל@ee<ENG> (“he rolled”). @p1[11]@p2<TIE>Because he foresaw<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. she would not be buried with him.@p3 There is a question on this explanation: If she would ask him, “Why are you crying?” he surely would not mention her death to her. What @ITwould@it he answer? Therefore Rashi brings another explanation. And with the second explanation alone, a question arises: Why would this great tzaddik cry because he came empty-handed? (@ITMaharshal@it)<QC>
@p1[12]@p2<TIE>Because her mother had died<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Regarding Rivkah it is written (24:28), “The girl told her mother’s household.” [Why here did Rochel tell her father?] Thus Rashi explains that Rochel’s mother had died. @p1[13]@p2<TIE>He thought that he was loaded with money<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Otherwise, why would he run? @p1@p2He thought: “Maybe he has brought gold coins<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”@p3 Since Lavan did not run [to greet Yaakov because of affection] but only because [he thought that Yaakov was loaded with] money, why then did Lavan embrace him? Thus Rashi explains as he does. @p1@p2He thought: “Maybe he has brought pearls and he has them in his mouth.”@p3 [Question:] Is it normal to carry jewels in one’s mouth?! The answer is: Someone carrying jewels hides them and does not reveal them. Lavan thought: “I will kiss him and appease him so that he will reveal to me what he has.” (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1@p2That he came only under duress, because of his brother.@p3 Otherwise why does it say, “@ITAll@it that had happened”? @p1[14]@p2<TIE>Now I have no reason to take you into the house<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., every @hh<HEB>אך@ee<ENG> comes to exclude something. What does it exclude here? Therefore Rashi explains, “Now I have no reason<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1@p2I will put up with you for a month@p3. You might ask: How does Rashi know [that Lavan said] specifically for a month? The answer is: Since he actually did so, as it says, “Yaakov lived with him for a month,” this surely is [what he said] at the beginning. @p1[15]@p2<TIE>Because you are my brother, should you work for me for nothing?@p3 Rashi is saying that the incredulity is not on the phrase, “You are my relative (@hh<HEB>אחי@ee<ENG>),” as they indeed were @hh<HEB>אחים@ee<ENG>, as in (13:8): “We are kinsmen (@hh<HEB>אחים@ee<ENG>).” Furthermore, if this is the meaning, then it should say @hh<HEB>הֲאָחִי אתה@ee<ENG>. Rather, the incredulity is on the phrase: “Should you work for me for nothing?” @p1[17]@p2<TIE>Because she thought she would fall to the lot of Eisov.@p3 [Rashi is answering the question:] Why does the verse speak badly about this righteous woman? He answers: “Because she thought<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” I.e., from her bad point we learn her good point. You might ask: The verse implies that Leah also was of beautiful form, but had tender eyes. If so, why does the verse contrast her with Rochel by saying, “Rochel was of beautiful form”? It should rather say, “The eyes of Rochel were beautiful.” The answer is: Since Leah’s eyes were not beautiful, @ITshe@it was not beautiful either. For it says in Taanis 24a: “If a bride’s eyes are beautiful, her entire body need not be checked.” Thus it was rightly said that “Rochel was of beautiful form.” @p1[18]@p2<TIE>These are the “few days” that his mother had told him<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Otherwise, he would be disobeying his mother’s command. @p1@p2And you may know<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. for it is written: They seemed to him<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is saying that by nature, Yaakov’s love of Rochel should make [even] a few days seem long—as it is written (Mishlei 13:12), “A delayed hope makes the heart sick.” [Why did seven years seem to him like a few days?] Perforce, it is referring to the “few days” that his mother had told him. @p1@p2And lest you say, “I will change Leah’s name<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” therefore, I say “the younger one.”@p3 You might ask: Why did he not just say, “Your younger daughter”? The answer is: Had he not said “Rochel,” Lavan would have given him Zilpah. She also was his daughter, but from a concubine, as Rashi explains on v. 31:50. And she was even younger than Rochel. But if so, why did Yaakov not fear Lavan might change Zilpah’s name to “Rochel,” and give her instead, since she was his youngest daughter? The answer is: Zilpah was not his true daughter as she was from a concubine. And her name was not really “Rochel” so he would have to change her name. Yaakov did not fear a double deceit by Lavan. Another answer [why Yaakov said “Rochel”]: If Yaakov had only said, “Your younger daughter,” perhaps Lavan’s wife would have another daughter, whom Lavan would give him. The marriage would be after seven years of work, and though she would be a minor, she would be fit for relations — as Yitzchok married Rivkah when she was just three. And then Lavan would not be tricking him at all, as the stipulation was to give his youngest daughter! Therefore Yaakov said: “For @ITRochel@it, your younger daughter.” @p1[21]@p2<TIE>Even the lowest of the low would not express himself in such a manner.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., it is not acceptable behavior for a hired worker to say, right when the years of his contract are up, “Give me my wages.” @p1[27]@p2<TIE>Immediately after the seven days of the marriage feast.@p3 For it is written, “And he completed the week for this one, and he gave him<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1[30]@p2<TIE>[The Torah] compares the others to the first<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi deduced this from the extra word @hh<HEB>אחרות@ee<ENG>. Alternatively, since it is written @hh<HEB>עוד@ee<ENG>, it implies “additional” ones similar to the first ones. Just as he was faithful in the first ones, as Lavan had not yet deceived him, so was he faithful in the latter ones, although he had deceived him. @p1[34]@p2<TIE>Since the Matriarchs were prophetesses<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 You might ask: [If so,] why does Megillah 14a mention only seven prophetesses — Sarah, Miriam, Devorah, Chan-nah, Avigayil, Chuldah and Ester? The answer is: Scripture testifies about Sarah [that she prophesized], as it is written (21:12): “Regarding all that Sarah tells you, listen to her,” teaching that Avraham was inferior to Sarah in prophecy. And so [Scripture testifies about] all of them. But we do not find [it written unequivocally] that the [other] Matriarchs prophesied, as our verse could follow to its simple meaning. @ITMaharshal@it answers that the Matriarchs prophesied only on matters pertaining to themselves: they knew what the future held for them but not for others. Therefore, they were not counted with the other prophetesses. @p1@p2With the exception of Leivi, because the Ark decimated them.@p3 I.e., the tribe of Leivi would carry the holy Ark and could not handle it with sufficient caution. Thus, many of them died.<QC>
@p1[1]@p2<TIE>She was envious of her good deeds.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because envy is [otherwise] forbidden. @p1@p2Did your father act this way to your mother.@p3 Rashi derives this from Yaakov’s answer: “Who has withheld @ITfrom you@it.” This implies, as Rashi says there, that Yaakov was saying: “You tell me to act as my father did. I am not like my father. It is from @ITyou@it that Hashem has withheld children, not from me,” implying that she had mentioned his father. @p1@p2From here, that one who has no children is considered as if dead.@p3 Otherwise, [if it meant that she is presently dying,] why did she ask for children? @hh<HEB>מתה@ee<ENG> is an adjective, not a present tense intransitive verb [conveying that she is dying]. And it is not a transitive verb [conveying that if Yaakov does not give her children, she will kill herself]. @p1[2]@p2<TIE>From you that He has withheld, not from me.@p3 Question: Many prophets prayed for others, such as Elisha (Melachim II 4:33), and [Eliyahu] for the Tzorphis woman. Why did not Yaakov, too, pray for her, although he had children? Furthermore, why was he angry? He should have answered her calmly, as the words of the wise are heard when spoken calmly. The answer is: Yaakov told Rochel that he had prayed for her, but Hashem did not accept the prayer. Rochel said, “If so, you must be wicked.” Thus he was angry with her, as she considered him wicked. He answered her: “I am not like my father. Both of them were childless, and his prayer was accepted because of both their merits. But I am not childless; Hashem has withheld children only from you. With us, only one person’s merit [is relevant]. That is why my prayer is not answered! (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1[3]@p2<TIE>She said to him, “Your grandfather Avraham, had children from Hagar<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”@p3 I.e., although he had children from Hagar he interceded for Sarah. So you too, although you have children, you should do the same for me. @p1[6]@p2<TIE>He has judged me and found me guilty, and found me innocent.@p3 In Bereishis Rabboh (71:7) it says: “He judged me and found me guilty — ‘Rochel was barren.’ He judged me and found me innocent — ‘And has given me a son.’” Accordingly, “Hashem has judged me” is one matter [i.e., “found me guilty”], and “He has also heard my voice” is another matter [i.e., “found me innocent”]. See @ITRe’m@it. @p1[8]@p2<TIE>Menachem ben Saruk explains it in the Machberes as @HB<HEB>צמיד פתיל@ee@BO<TIE><ENG>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Meaning: In his work that connects words of the same root, he connects @hh<HEB>נפתולי אלהים נפתלתי@ee<ENG> with @hh<HEB>צמיד פתיל@ee<ENG>.<QC>
@p1[11]@p2<TIE>He was born circumcised<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Accordingly, @hh<HEB>גד@ee<ENG> means “cutting,” that is to say that the cutting @p3of his circumcision was already done. @p1[15]@p2<TIE>With me.<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Otherwise, what does “in exchange for” mean? “Your son’s jasmines” clearly implies a complete trade, i.e., each gives something that is his. @p1@p2Because she made light<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. she did not merit being buried with him.@p3 [You might ask:] Does it not it say in Bereishis Rabboh 82:11 [that she was buried on the road] so she would assist her children when Nevuzaradan will exile them, as Rashi explains in Parshas Vayechi (48:7)? The answer is: Had she not made light of Yaakov, Leah would be buried there instead, and @ITshe@it would assist her children. Because Rochel made light, she did not merit being buried with him.<QC>
@p1[16]@p2<TIE>God helped him<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is saying that @hh<HEB>הוא@ee<ENG> refers to Hashem, for otherwise, [if it meant “that night,”] it should say @hb<HEB>ה@hhהוא@ee<ENG>. How did He help him? Yaakov came from the field riding a donkey, intending to ride to Rochel’s tent. Hashem caused the donkey to bray so that Leah would hear and go out to meet Yaakov, so he would come to her tent. And so it was. He came to Leah’s tent, and that night, Yissachar was conceived. Thus it says @hh<HEB>יששכר חמור גרם@ee<ENG>(49:14). I.e., how did @hh<HEB>יששכר@ee<ENG> come to be born? @hh<HEB>חמור גרם@ee<ENG>. I.e., the donkey was the cause (@hh<HEB>הגורם@ee<ENG>). @p1[17]@p2<TIE>She desired and sought to increase the number of tribes.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because normally the phrase @hh<HEB>וישמע אלהים@ee<ENG> pertains only if one prayed. But here it is not stated that she prayed for sons. Thus Rashi explains, “Because she desired<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” I.e., since she so wished to increase the tribes, it was considered as if she prayed for this — and Hashem granted her wish. @p1[20]@p2<TIE>Having a similar meaning as @HB<HEB>בית זבול@ee@BO<TIE><ENG>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Meaning: his dwelling will be with me. The suffix @hh<HEB>ויזבל@hbני@ee<ENG> denotes “with me.” It does not mean he will take me to his dwelling. @p1@p2His main dwelling place will not be other than with me<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 @ITRe’m@it writes: I do not know why Rashi states it as a negative, “Will not be other than,” rather than as a positive, as the verse itself implies: “Now his main dwelling @ITwill@it be with me.” @p1[22]@p2<TIE>He remembered that she gave her signs to her sister<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Otherwise, what did He remember about her? In Scripture, @hh<HEB>זכירה@ee<ENG> always refers to a deed. For example (8:1), “And Hashem remembered Noach and all the beasts<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” which Rashi explains there: “That they did not cohabit in the ark.” And so with the @hh<HEB>זכירה@ee<ENG> of Lot (19:29), he did not tell [the Egyptians] that Sarah was Avraham’s sister. @p1@p2She was concerned lest she fall to Eisov’s lot<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [The reward] is measure for measure. Since Rochel acted so that her sister would not be sent away in shame from her husband, it is not fitting that she should be barren and be sent away in shame from her husband. (@ITGur Aryeh@it) @p1@p2This is what the poet alluded to: “When the Red One<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”@p3 @hh<HEB>האדמון@ee<ENG> refers to Eisov. @hh<HEB>כבט@ee<ENG> means, “When he saw.” @hh<HEB>שלא חלה@ee<ENG> means, “That Rochel did not have birth pangs.” @hh<HEB>צבה@ee<ENG> means “he desired” to take her as wife, and she was petrified.<QC>
@p1[23]@p2<TIE>He has brought it into a place where it will not be seen.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., @hh<HEB>אסף@ee<ENG> does not mean that her shame was [previously scattered and now] gathered into one place, as that would be to her detriment — her shame would be seen more. @p1@p2As long as a woman has no child she has no one to blame for her faults<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Accordingly, “my shame” means my fault and my sin for breaking my husband’s household utensils.<QC>
@p1[27]@p2<TIE>Is it possible that he had sons and would send his daughter<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.?@p3 You might ask: Perhaps he had younger boys [who were too young to be sent]? The answer is: If so, he would have sent Bilhah or Zilpah, who were from a concubine, rather than Rochel who was his daughter from his true wife. If he had no sons, it is understandable to send Rochel, for then she will inherit him. [According to the laws of inheritance] daughters from a true wife come before daughters from a concubine. Consequently, she would surely guard [his flock] well. But if he had sons, she would not inherit any property, as sons come before daughters according to the laws of inheritance. Were that the case, he would not have sent Rochel. Perforce, he had no sons at all. (@ITMahara’i@it) @p1[29]@p2<TIE>The meager amount<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., it does not mean that Lavan knew his livestock was with Yaakov, rather that he knew of the livestock’s meager amount. @p1[30]@p2<TIE>For the needs of my household.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is explaining that @hh<HEB>לביתי@ee<ENG> does not mean as it seems to, that Yaakov is saying he will go “to my home,” i.e., return to his father’s house and stay there. For Lavan said afterwards, “What shall I give you? <TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” [And Yaakov replied], “I will continue to tend<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>..” This shows that he did not intend to leave Lavan, but to [stay and] guard his flock. Perforce, @hh<HEB>לביתי@ee<ENG> means “for the @ITneeds@it of my household.” @p1@p2Now only my sons provide my needs<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi explains this since @hh<HEB>גם אנכי@ee<ENG> implies that previously, some else was doing for the needs of his household. Thus Rashi explains: “Now only my sons<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1[32]@p2<TIE>Dark brown, similar to red.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., Onkelos translates @hh<HEB>חום@ee<ENG> as @hh<HEB>שחום@ee<ENG>, which means red.<QC>
@p1@p2Speckled and spotted among the goats and dark brown among the sheep<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 @ITRe’m@it asks: If so, speckled and spotted was the sign for goats, but not for sheep. Yet, does not the verse say, “I will remove from them every @hh<HEB>שה@ee<ENG> that is speckled or spotted,” [ostensibly referring to sheep]? He answers: The word @hh<HEB>שה@ee<ENG> in our verse refers to goats. For it is written (Devarim 14:4): @hh<HEB>שה כבשים ושה עזים@ee<ENG>, showing that goats too, can be called @hh<HEB>שה@ee<ENG>. @ITMaharshal@it objects: On the contrary, since Scripture needed to specify (in Devarim 14:4) that @hh<HEB>שה@ee<ENG> also refers to goats, this indicates that wherever @hh<HEB>שה@ee<ENG> appears without specification, it refers to sheep and not goats! Furthermore, our verse should have combined the phrases and said only, “And every goat that is spotted and speckled.” Also, why does the verse speak first of goats and then switch to sheep? Furthermore, it is written in v. 35, “That day he removed the @hh<HEB>תישים@ee<ENG>.” Why when referring to goats does Scripture sometimes say @hh<HEB>שה@ee<ENG> and other times @hh<HEB>תיש@ee<ENG>? @ITMaharshal@it answers: It seems to me that @hh<HEB>שה@ee<ENG> means sheep, not goats. Nevertheless, the sign [of Yaakov’s wages] was speckled or spotted for goats, and dark brown for sheep, [as Rashi says]. And when Yaakov said, “Remove from them every @hh<HEB>שה@ee<ENG> that is speckled or spotted,” he meant as follows: You surely should take away the speckled and spotted goats, and the dark brown sheep, [as those kinds will be my wages]. And take away @ITeven@it the speckled or spotted sheep, [kinds] which should have been mine [but in fact are not]. This way I will not have any of the speckled or spotted goats, or any of the speckled, ringed or spotted sheep. Only those that will be born from now on, i.e., the speckled or spotted goats, and the dark brown sheep, will be mine. But Yaakov did not say to take away the dark brown goats because there were none to be found. This answers all the questions. @p1@p2Furthermore, that you may not say<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. because of the speckled and spotted males<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 According to the first explanation, they could simply count how many there are now, and know that all above this number were born later. Thus Rashi says: “Furthermore, that you may not say<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (@ITRe’m@it) @p1[33]@p2<TIE>For my righteousness will come and testify before you<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi is saying that] @hb<HEB>ת@hhבוא@ee<ENG> is third person feminine, not [masculine] second person. The proof is: it is written the righteousness will come “before you,” as if Yaakov said: “For my righteousness will come before you and testify concerning my wages.” @p1@p2And it is through theft that it is in my possession@p3. On the phrase, “Is stolen if it is in my possession,” why did Rashi need to offer an explanation: “It will be obvious that I have stolen it from you”? [The answer is:] So we will not think it means, “I bought it properly, but it turned out to be stolen merchandise, which I did not know.” Thus Rashi explains as he does. @p1[34]@p2<TIE>A term indicating acceptance of terms@p3. [Rashi is explaining that here it is] not like @hb<HEB>הן@hh לי לא נתת זרע@ee<ENG> (15:3), which means @hh<HEB>הנה@ee<ENG> (behold). @p1@p2If only you remain satisfied with this.@p3 I.e., although Yaakov said it verbally, Lavan thought: perhaps he does not mean it in his heart, or he will change his mind. @p1[35]@p2<TIE>Lavan, on that day<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows that our verse speaks of Lavan and] not Yaakov, for it is written afterwards, “And he gave them to his sons and he placed a three days’ journey between @IThimself@it and @ITYaakov@it.” @p1[37]@p2<TIE>It is a tree called @HB<HEB>לבנה@ee@BO<TIE><ENG>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Otherwise, [if @hh<HEB>לבנה@ee<ENG> meant white], it should be written@hh<HEB>לְבָנָה @ee<ENG>. @ITRe’m@it explains that if [it meant] the tree was white, why did Yaakov need to peel it to make it white? It already was white! @p1@p2He also took a stick from @HB<HEB>לוז@ee@BO<TIE><ENG>.<TIE>.<TIE>. @boRashi is answering the question: @hh<HEB>לבנה@ee<ENG> is not @hh<HEB>לוז@ee<ENG>; [so why does the verse describe it as such?] Thus Rashi explains, “He @ITalso@it took a stick from @hh<HEB>לוז@ee<ENG>. @ITRe’m@it explains that “were fresh” interrupts between “poplar” and “hazel”, thus [Rashi explains that the phrase] “hazel and chestnut” is a separate point. @p1[38]@p2<TIE>Where the water was running<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows that @hh<HEB>רהטים@ee<ENG> means running] because the Targum of [(Bereishis 18:2)] @hh<HEB>וירץ@ee<ENG> (he ran) is @hh<HEB>ורהט@ee<ENG>. @p1@p2In the ducts where the flock came to drink<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 @hh<HEB>אשר תבאן הצאן@ee<ENG> forms one phrase with @hh<HEB>שקתות המים@ee<ENG>, so that @hh<HEB>נוכח הצאן@ee<ENG> refers back to @hh<HEB>ויצג המקלות@ee<ENG>. Rashi is saying that Yaakov stuck the rods into the ducts and watering troughs so the rods would be in front of the flock when it drank, so the animals will become heated.<QC>
@p1@p2The female animal would see the sticks<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Otherwise, [if they were not startled backwards,] why does it say, “They became heated”? Water does not usually cause animals to become heated. And according to R. Hoshaya, “heated” means “pregnant.” @p1[39]@p2<TIE>To the appearance of the sticks@p3. [Rashi explains this] because the @ITsticks@it did not make the animals have ringed, speckled and spotted offspring. It was the sticks’ @ITappearance@it that did this, i.e., the uncovered white. You might ask: How could Yaakov commit this trickery? There are many explanations, but it seems to me that Yaakov did it with his own flock, [not with Lavan’s.] The offspring of Yaakov’s flock rightfully belonged to Yaakov even without these signs, but Lavan wanted to take even those offspring from him. Yaakov thought: I will make sticks so that the offspring of my flock will all be speckled and spotted, to gain what is rightfully mine. (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1[40]@p2<TIE>So that the flock faced the<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. the brown ones that he found among Lavan’s flock.@p3 The [second] flock mentioned here means the goats, as Lavan had taken away all the brown sheep, as it says in v. 35. But Lavan did not separate the brown goats since this [kind] was not Yaakov’s wages. Similarly, he did not separate the speckled and spotted from the sheep, only from the goats, as I [@ITRe’em@it] wrote above. This is because these [kinds of sheep] were not Yaakov’s wages. (See the @ITRe’m’s@it elaboration here.) @ITRe’m@it writes further that [when Rashi says, “Those that were born spotted and speckled,”] the phrase “those that were born” is likely a misprint [and should be omitted], unless we say it refers to those already born @ITbefore@it Lavan took away [part of his flock]. Then, Rashi would be saying: Those speckled and spotted [sheep] already born to Lavan’s flock, which Lavan did not take away because these [kinds] were not Yaakov’s wages. @p1[43]@p2<TIE>Fruitful and multiply more than other flock.@p3 @hh<HEB>צאן רבות@ee<ENG> cannot mean what it sounds like, that he had many flocks, for it is already written, “The man became tremendously prosperous” — which surely refers to the flocks mentioned before. Rather it means, “That are fruitful<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (@ITRe’m@it) @p1@p2He would sell his flock at a high price and buy for himself all these@p3. [Rashi knows it means this] because otherwise, why does Scripture mention slaves while recounting [how the rods increased] the flock? @ITR. Meir Stern@it writes: [Rashi knows it means this] because otherwise, it should have mentioned people before animals. Moreover, why does Scripture go back and speak of animals, saying: “Camels and donkeys”? Thus Rashi says, “He would sell<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” to explain that the flock was mentioned first because he owned it first. Then Scripture mentions what he bought by selling the flock, placing people before animals. And since everything is now in proper order, we need not say, [to explain the order in which they are listed,] that he sold the slaves to buy camels and donkeys, as he did with the flock [to buy the slaves]. Therefore Rashi says, “And buy for himself @ITall@it these” — all was bought with the money he received from selling the flock. @p1[3]@p2<TIE>And there I will be with you<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 This was not a stipulation: “If you return, I will be with you. And if not, I will not be with you.” Rather, Hashem was telling him the reason: Because here it is not possible [to rest My Divine Presence upon you]. @p1@p2It is not possible to rest My Divine Presence upon you@p3. “I will be with you” cannot mean, “To guard you on the way,” because Yaakov had already been promised this (28:15): “I am with you, and I will guard you wherever you go.” Rather it means, “There I will rest My Divine Presence upon you,” which necessarily includes the promise that he will not be killed on the way. This explains Rashi’s comment in Parshas Vayishlach (32:10): “You made two promises to me<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” implying that when it says here, “I will be with you,” it means, “I will guard you on the way.” @p1[7]@p2<TIE>@HB<HEB>מונים@ee@BO<ENG> is no less than ten@p3. @hh<HEB>מונים@ee<ENG> is a term of counting, which is [done in sets of] ten. It is written, “Ten @hh<HEB>מונים@ee<ENG>,” i.e., 10 x 10 =100. But @hh<HEB>מונים@ee<ENG> does not mean “times.” @p1@p2We thus learn that he changed his conditions 100 times.@p3 Rashi explains it as changing the conditions rather than changing the form of payment because it would cause no loss if Lavan changed the wages. For example, if Lavan owed cash but gave movables, [thereby changing the form of payment,] this would not be a loss. Thus Rashi explains that Lavan changed the actual conditions, as Rashi says on v. 41: “You kept changing the condition between us, from speckled to spotted<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”<QC>
@p1[10]@p2<TIE>The angels would bring them<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is saying that the spotted males going upon the flock surely were not those males born [after the agreement, which rightfully belonged] to Yaakov. For if so, what is the verse coming to teach us? Perforce, they were Lavan’s flock. And [if you ask:] How did they get here? Rashi explains, “Although Lavan<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. the angels would bring them.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1@p2A white strand encircled its body<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., one could run one’s hand along the white strand, for the black did not interrupt. The white strand stretched around its entire body. @p1[15]@p2<TIE>For he withheld the wages for your work.@p3 I.e, of the six years that you worked for pay. @p1[17]@p2<TIE>Whereas Eisov put the females ahead of the males<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Because he was lustful, and his wives were his primary interest. (@ITRe’m@it)<QC>
@p1[18]@p2<TIE>That which he had obtained for his sheep<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [@hh<HEB>מקנה קנינו@ee<ENG>] means the purchases resulting from his livestock: what he bought by selling his flock. “He led away all his livestock” refers to the [spotted] livestock that was born and constituted his wages. @p1[19]@p2<TIE>That he had given to his sons<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. three-days’ travel<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi says this because of the coming verse (v. 22): “Lavan was told on the third day<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” And why didn’t Lavan know until the third day? Perforce it was because, “A distance of three-days’ travel<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1@p2She intended to remove her father from idol-worship.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because it is written, “That belonged to her father,” an apparent superfluous phrase. It should simply say, “His idols.” Perforce, she intended to remove her father from idolatry. @p1[23]@p2<TIE>The entire distance that Yaakov traveled in seven days<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi means: if Yaakov would have traveled from the place of Lavan’s flock, it would have taken him seven days.<QC>
@p1[24]@p2<TIE>All that is considered good by the wicked is bad as regards to the righteous.@p3 [Accordingly,] it seems that the verse means: Do not speak with Yaakov that which is good for you, that he should return with you to Charan, since for him that is bad — for as long as Yaakov associates with a wicked person, the Divine Presence will not rest upon him. @BO @bo @p1[26]@p2<TIE>An army going to war is called “sword.”@p3 [Rashi explains this] because “prisoners” are not of a @hh<HEB>חרב@ee<ENG> (sword). It should have said, “Prisoners of an army.”<QC>
@p1[33]@p2<TIE>Because Yaakov was constantly with her.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Why does it say, “Yaakov’s tent”? Did Lavan suspect Yaakov of idol worship?! Especially as Yaakov was returning to his father’s house, about which Lavan himself said (v. 30): “For you yearned for your father’s house, but why did you steal my gods,” when your father’s house is not idolatrous? Thus Rashi explains that it is the same as Rochel’s tent.<QC>
@p1@p2When he left Leah’s tent he returned to Rochel’s tent<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Yaakov’s tent is Rochel’s tent, as Rashi just explained. If so, why does it say, “And came into Rochel’s tent,” when he already searched it? Furthermore, why is it written, “He left Leah’s tent and came into Rochel’s tent”? It should have written: “He left the tent of the @ITtwo handmaidens@it and came into Rochel’s tent,” as he already left Leah’s tent and came to the tents of the handmaidens. Thus Rashi explains, “When he left Leah’s tent he returned to Rochel’s<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1[37]@p2<TIE>Let them determine who is right@p3. The meaning of this expression is similar to (24:14), “The girl will be the one whom You have determined (@hh<HEB>הוכחת@ee<ENG>) for your servant.” Its meaning is not similar to (21:25), “Avraham then reprimanded (@hh<HEB>והוכיח@ee<ENG>) Avimelech.” For if so, it should have said @hh<HEB>ויוכיחו @ee@hhאותנו@ee<ENG>.<QC>
@p1[38]@p2<TIE>From here they derive that even a one-dayold ram is called @HB<HEB>איל@ee@BO<TIE><ENG>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [You might ask:] Doesn’t Rashi comment on Bamidbar 15:11 that if it is under a year old it is called @hh<HEB>כבש@ee<ENG>, and only after 13 months it is called @hh<HEB>איל@ee<ENG>? [The answer is:] That is true only in regard to sacrifices. See Tosafos, Bava Kama 65b. @p1[39]@p2<TIE>I will suffer its loss. If it be missing<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi adds the words, “@ITIf@it it be missing,” because you might ask: Yaakov declared, “Your she-goats never miscarried<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. I never brought you a mutilated animal<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>..” If so, why did he then say, “I would take the blame for it,” [when no animal was missing]? Therefore Rashi explains, “@ITIf@it it be missing.” Yaakov was saying: If something ever happened and any animal was missing, I would take the blame for it. I.e., I would cover the loss. @p1[40]@p2<TIE>The same meaning as a consuming fire.@p3 @hh<HEB>אוכלה@ee<ENG> denotes destruction (@hh<HEB>כלייה@ee<ENG>), [not eating (@hh<HEB>אכילה@ee<ENG>)].<QC>
@p1[42]@p2<TIE>Yaakov was afraid to say @HB<HEB>אלהי@ee@BO<ENG> and instead said @HB<HEB>ופחד@ee@BO<ENG>.@p3 Question: Did he not say @hh<HEB>אלהי יצחק@ee<ENG> in Parshas Vayishlach (32:10)? The answer is: There, Yaakov was recounting how Hashem had said “@hh<HEB>אלהי יצחק@ee<ENG>.” @p1[43]@p2<TIE>“How could it enter my heart to cause them any harm?”@p3 [I.e.,] it cannot mean that Lavan asked Yaakov, “What do you want me to do to them?” because Yaakov never asked him [to do anything].<QC>
@p1[44]@p2<TIE>God [being the witness].@p3 Since @hh<HEB>והיה לעד@ee<ENG> is written without specifying [its subject], perforce it refers to the preceding phrase: “The God of my father.” Furthermore, if it referred to the pact, it should say @hh<HEB>והיתה@ee<ENG> (feminine form). @p1@p2 @p1[49]@p2<TIE>This Mitzpah is the one on Mount Gilad.@p3 Rashi means as follows: Why is Mount Gilad called Mitzpah, as seen from the verse in Shoftim 11:29, which mentions Mitzpah? [The answer is:] The verse itself explains that Gilad is called also Mitzpah because they said to one another, “May Hashem watch (@hh<HEB>יצף@ee<ENG>)<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1[52]@p2<TIE>Here @HB<HEB>אם@ee@BO<ENG> is used to mean “that”<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., @hh<HEB>אם@ee<ENG> [in its usual meaning of “if”] implies uncertainty. But here it cannot be explained so. Thus Rashi explains, “Here, @hh<HEB>אם@ee<ENG> is used to mean ‘that’.” It comes in place of [the prefix] @hh<HEB>ש@ee<ENG>, as if it said @hh<HEB>ועדה המצבה @hbש@hhאני לא אעבור@ee<ENG>. @p1[54]@p2<TIE>For his friends who were with Lavan@p3. Here Rashi does not explain “his brethren” as “his sons” as he did on v. 46, “Yaakov said to his brethren,” because here he would not make a feast for his sons. [You might ask:] Why did Rashi not explain there as he does here? The answer is: There Yaakov issued a command and said, “Gather stones.” He would say so only to those under his authority. Therefore Rashi explained it there as “his sons.” @p1@p2Food, in general, is called bread<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Why does it not say, “To eat meat,” as he slaughtered animals for them? @p1[3]@p2<TIE>Two camps—from outside Eretz Yisrael<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Question: Rashi explained on, “Ascending and descending” (v. 28:12), that the two [groups of angels] were not together. Rather, one ascended and only then the other descended. [Why were both groups together here?] The answer is: Rashi explains at the beginning of Parshas Vayishlach that Yaakov sent actual angels [to Eisov]. Accordingly, it means as follows: Here too, the angels of outside Eretz Yisrael wanted to ascend before the angels of Eretz Yisrael would descend. But Yaakov forced them to stay because he wanted to send them to Eisov. If so, this implies that [the messengers sent by Yaakov] were actual angels.<QC>
@p1[4]@p2<TIE>Actual angels.@p3 Otherwise, why does it need to say @hh<HEB>לפניו@ee<ENG>? The verse is saying that Yaakov sent the messengers [i.e., the angels] who were @hh<HEB>לפניו@ee<ENG>. In other words, he sent the ones mentioned before: “And the angels of Elohim met him” (v. 2). (@ITRe’m@it) Much more has been said regarding this. See @ITGur Aryeh, R. Noson@it and @ITNachalas Yaakov.@it @p1[5]@p2<TIE>I have not become an officer or anyone of importance.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Otherwise it should simply say, “With Lavan I was delayed.” @p1@p2Another explanation: The @BIgematria@BO of @HB<HEB>גרתי@BO<TIE><ENG>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@BO I have kept @HB<HEB>תרי"ג@BO<ENG> commandments.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Thus, you cannot defeat me. When your father blessed you that “you shall live by your sword” (27:40), that is only “When you have cause to be grieved” (ibid). [I.e., “When the Israelites will transgress the Torah.”] But I kept the whole Torah! @ITMaharshal@it explains that Rashi is answering the question: Why did Yaakov say, “I have not become an officer<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”? For this actually would allow the wicked Eisov to claim, “If the blessings were not fulfilled for you, you surely did not keep the mitzvos! Thus I should fulfill regarding you, ‘When you have cause to be grieved, you will throw off his yoke from your neck.’” Therefore Yaakov told him, “I kept all the 613 mitzvos. Nevertheless, I have not become an officer.” @p1[6]@p2<TIE>These are neither from the heavens nor from the earth.@p3 Although they are nourished from the earth, they do not actually grow from the earth. Otherwise, [if Yaakov meant as follows, a contradiction arises.] First he said, “I lived as a stranger,” to convey that the blessings were not fulfilled. Then he said @hh<HEB>ויהי לי שור וחמור@ee<ENG>, [detailing his many blessings. And he must have meant @hh<HEB>שור וחמור@ee<ENG> in plural,] as is customary to refer to many oxen as “ox.” This is obviously so, for he sent Eisov a whole camp as a gift, and would be proven a liar if he meant, “I acquired one ox [and one donkey].” According to Rashi’s other explanation above, Yaakov was saying: “Although I kept the 613 mitzvos, my father’s blessing has not been realized. I have only oxen and donkeys, not the rest of my father’s blessing, which is “from the fat of the land.” Therefore, [since my merits have not been offset by my rewards,] I do not fear you. @p1@p2To announce that I am coming to you.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because if Yaakov was sending [the messengers] to tell him, “I lived as a stranger with Lavan<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. I acquired oxen and donkeys<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” then [the next phrase,] “To find favor in your eyes,” would also refer to this. And that cannot be, for such a message is not a reason to find favor; it is merely [a reason] that Eisov should not hate him. Therefore Rashi explains, “To announce that I am coming to you” to be subservient to you — and through this will I find favor in your eyes. @ITMaharshal@it writes that Rashi is answering the question: Yaakov said before, “This is what you should say.” Why does he say [again], “To tell my master”? Perforce it means, “To announce that I am coming.” In this way I will find favor, because when people send [messages] to appease someone, they do not come themselves. But I will even come myself! All this is because I am at peace with you. @p1[7]@p2<TIE>But he acts towards you as the wicked Eisov.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Otherwise, why does it say, “Eisov”? Yaakov had only one brother! Perforce, “Eisov” connotes he who is famous for extreme wickedness. (@ITRe’m@it) A further explanation: Rashi is answering the question: It should say @hh<HEB>באנו אל עשו אחיך@ee<ENG>, like it is written @hh<HEB>אל עשו אחיו@ee<ENG> at the beginning of the @ITparshah@it. Why does it say @hh<HEB>אל אחיך אל עשו@ee<ENG>? @ITMaharshal@it explains [that Rashi is answering the question:] Why does it say @hh<HEB>אל@ee<ENG> twice? We need not object: [Accordingly,] why did Yaakov say @hb<HEB>ל@hhאדוני @hbל@hhעשו@ee<ENG> (v. 4)? For the answer is: There, Yaakov was commanding them to speak with honor. But here, where they are reporting the reply to Yaakov, why did they speak in this fashion? Thus Rashi explains as he does.<QC>
@p1[8]@p2<TIE>@HB<HEB>ויירא@ee@BO<ENG> lest he be killed.@p3 You might ask: Had Hashem not promised him when he left his father’s house, “And I will bring you back to this land” (28:15)? The Gemara (Berachos 4a, Sanhedrin 98b) answers: [He feared that] sin might cause [the promise not to be fulfilled]. Another answer: The promise was only, “And I will bring you back to this land,” meaning to Eretz Yisrael, but not to his father’s house. See @ITRe’m@it, @ITR. Noson, Gur Aryeh@it and @ITMinchas Yaakov@it. @p1@p2@HB<HEB>ויצר לו@BO<ENG> that he might kill others.@p3 [Question: Why did this distress him?] The answer is: Yaakov feared he might kill Eisov, and Yitzchok loved Eisov and considered him a good person. It would pain Yitzchok greatly and bring him to curse Yaakov. (@ITMidrash Tanchuma@it) An alternative answer: Yaakov surely did not fear killing Eisov, for it says in Sanhedrin 72a: “If someone comes to kill you, kill him first.” Rather, Yaakov feared that he might kill Eisov’s men, who came to kill not Yaakov but Yaakov’s men. Only Eisov came to kill Yaakov. Indeed, Eisov’s men would be attacking Yaakov’s men, and one may save the attacked even by taking the attacker’s life. But if injuring the attacker’s limb would suffice to save the one being attacked, then for killing the attacker [instead of just injuring him] one is liable for the death penalty. Thus, Yaakov feared he might kill them in the confusion of war even where injuring a limb would suffice. Some ask: Why did Yaakov fear being killed? Eisov said, “When the mourning days for my father approach, I will kill my brother Yaakov” (27:41), and Yitzchok was still alive. A further question: Why did Eisov send Elifaz to kill Yaakov [at the time that Yitzchok was alive]? It seems the answer is: When Eisov said he will not kill Yaakov while his father is alive, this applied only if Yaakov was with Yitzchok. But if he was elsewhere, Eisov would kill him. See @ITMinchas Yaakov@it. @p1[9]@p2<TIE>Against his will, because I will do battle with him.@p3 I.e., while I will do battle with him, the second camp surely will have time to escape. @ITMaharshal@it writes that Rashi inferred this because it is not written, “@ITPerhaps@it the remaining camp will survive,” but, “The remaining camp @ITwill@it survive.” This implies, “Against his will, because I will do battle<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>..” Rashi said all this, based on Scriptural inferences, to support @ITChazal’s@it teaching that Yaakov prepared himself for three things. [Rashi says “against his will,” i.e., it surely will be.] This is because the verse cannot mean “perhaps” [the remaining camp will survive]. If so, it would be more logical to gather everyone in one camp to fight Eisov—for maybe they will win due to greater numbers. However if the remaining camp will [surely] survive, against Eisov’s will, it is proper for Yaakov to have divided them into two camps. For it is better to act in a manner that will surely save one camp, even if it places the other camp in greater danger, than to put them in a situation in which they are not sure whether they all will be lost or saved. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1@p2He prepared himself for three things.@p3 All three are derived from Scripture [see @ITPesikta D’Rav Kahana@it 19:3]. And “war” is derived from, “The remaining camp will survive,” showing that this phrase refers to war. Thus Rashi explains it as, “I will do battle with him.”<QC>
@p1[10]@p2<TIE>Return to the Land of your father and to your birthplace, and I will be with you<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Yaakov was saying: Since You promised to be with me when I come to the Land of my fathers, if I die on the way, it will turn out that Your promise to me was not fulfilled. @p1[11]@p2<TIE>My merits have diminished because of the kindnesses and truth.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 @hb<HEB>מ@hhכל החסדים@ee<ENG> means @ITbecause@it of the kindnesses. @hh<HEB>ו@hbאת@hh עבדך@ee<ENG> means, “That you have done @ITwith@it me.” Rashi is explaining that [in this verse,] @hh<HEB>את@ee<ENG> means “with.” @p1@p2Lest from the time You made me the promises, I have become tainted by sin<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 For the reason of diminished merits alone, Yaakov would not have feared, as there is no death without sin and no suffering without iniquity (Shabbos 55a). Thus Rashi brings also the reason of “tainted by sin.” And for the reason of “tainted by sin” alone, we might think that Yaakov still need not have feared, as his merits would outweigh his sins. Thus Rashi brings also the reason of diminished merits. Due to both of these reasons, Yaakov was frightened. @p1@p2“Making Your words come true.<TIE>.<TIE>.”@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Just because Hashem spoke [true promises], should Yaakov’s merits diminish? For Rashi said above, “My merits have diminished.” [Therefore Rashi explains, “You have @ITkept@it all the promises.”] And why did Rashi say, “You have @ITkept@it,” rather than, “You have @ITdone@it,” as the verse says? Because [the fulfillment of] what one says is not called @hh<HEB>עשייה@ee<ENG>, but @hh<HEB>שמירה@ee<ENG>. I.e., “keeping” it is the same as “doing” it. @p1@p2The Midrashic explanation is: He placed his staff into the Jordan [River] and the Jordan split.@p3 According to this, [Yaakov is saying that] Hashem did him two good deeds: the splitting the Jordan, and the [dividing into] two camps. But according to the simple meaning, there is only one kindness. @p1[12]@p2<TIE>“From the hand of my brother who does not act towards me as a brother<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”@p3 Here too, Rashi deduced this because @hh<HEB>מיד@ee<ENG> is written twice. And Yaakov would not use an expression of honor [about Eisov] when speaking to Hashem. (@ITMaharshal@it)<QC>
@p1[13]@p2<TIE>@HB<HEB>היטיב@BO<ENG> on account of your merits, and @HB<HEB>איטיב@BO<ENG> on account of your fathers’ merits. @boAlthough the Torah speaks in the language of man, [thus a double verb need not be expounded,] here it is clear that it is to be expounded. For it should have said @hh<HEB>היטב @hbת@hhיטב@ee<ENG>, in second person, like @hh<HEB>העניק @hbת@hhעניק@ee<ENG> (Devarim 15:14). This is preferable to @ITRe’m’s@it explanation, that whenever an exposition can be made it should be made. You might ask: Rashi explained on v. 11 that Yaakov said, “My merits have diminished.” [Why did he pray here on account of his own merits?] The answer is: He surely was not praying here on account of his merits, but on account of his fathers’ merits. That is why Rashi adds, “I will do good on account of your fathers’ merits.” @p1@p2Until I have done.@p3 Also this verse shows that, “Until I have done that which I have spoken for you,” refers to [what Hashem spoke to] Avraham, as Rashi explained on v. 28:15. Otherwise, the difficulty [remains]: Hashem never said this to Yaakov.<QC>
@p1[14]@p2<TIE>In his possession.@p3 There is a question [on the first explanation]: Why does it need to say @hh<HEB>בידו@ee<ENG>? [Obviously, he took only from what was his!] Thus Rashi brings the Midrashic explanation that it refers to jewels. But there is a question on this: Why does it not mention [the type of jewel] by name, [as it does with the animals]? Therefore Rashi brings the alternate explanation, about tithes. But this explanation alone does not suffice, because why did it say, “Which comes into his hand”? The non-sacred was already in his hand, [as he made it so by tithing it]. That is why Rashi presents all the explanations. (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1[15]@p2<TIE>Once an animal has become pregnant it does not accept the male.@p3 Rashi is saying that it is the nature of an animal to mate as often as enjoyment calls for and free time permits. Since he-goats and rams are free all day, Yaakov gave them ten females each. This enabled them to fulfill their desire and maximize offspring for the owner. And so Yaakov gave each [type of male animal] according to its free time. This raises a question: Although he-goats and rams are free all day, they do not know that their mating with many females benefits the owner. Perhaps one male will fulfill its desire with one female, mating with it repeatedly? To this Rashi answers: “Once an animal has become pregnant.<TIE>.<TIE>.” This forces the male to separate from her and go to a second and a third, etc. @ITRe’m@it explained differently; the reader may decide. See Kesubos 62a, which says that free time serves as the determining factor. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1[16]@p2<TIE>And their young were with them.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is saying that there were also thirty young ones. Otherwise, why would it include them all in the same number, when the verse is coming to describe how large the gift was? The young are not significant when [included] with their mothers! Perforce, the verse should be rearranged to read: @hh<HEB>גמלים מניקות שלשים ובניהם@ee<ENG>. @p1@p2The Midrashic explanation<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. one male per female.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Accordingly, @hh<HEB>שלשים@ee<ENG> is rightly written after @hh<HEB>בניהם@ee<ENG>, for it indicates that there were thirty altogether. The numbers of the males and of the females were not stated explicitly because camels are discreet in mating. @p1@p2And their young were with them<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 This [first explanation] is saying that there were also thirty young ones. Question: If so, why does it not say @hh<HEB>שלשים@ee<ENG> also for the young, like it does for the nursing camels? Thus Rashi brings the Midrashic explanation, that they were thirty altogether. And so that we will not ask, “If so, why does the verse not state the numbers of the males and of the females?” Therefore Rashi explains, “Since it is discreet in mating<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” And in fact there were fifteen males and fifteen females. (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1[17]@p2<TIE>A distance of one day or less.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows that they were] not immediately ahead of Yaakov, because it is written in v. 22: “The present passed on ahead of him, but he spent the night in the camp.” If they were just a short way from Yaakov, they could have all spent the night together. And they were not more than a day’s distance ahead, because Yaakov gave Eisov the present on the same day [after daybreak], as is evident from the coming verses. @p1@p2And I will follow behind you.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because Yaakov told them to say to Eisov, “And see, he himself is also behind us.” Thus, Yaakov must have said it to them, too: “Pass on ahead of me and I will follow behind you.” @p1@p2One herd was ahead of the other.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is explaining that they were herd behind herd. [Rashi knows this] because if they were lined up alongside each other, how could they be described [in the coming verses as] first, second and third? They would all be “first.”<QC>
@p1[18]@p2<TIE>@BITo@BO whom is this gift being sent.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., the second @hh<HEB>למי@ee<ENG> conveys [“to whom”, which is] its primary meaning. But @hh<HEB>למי אתה@ee<ENG> does not convey its primary meaning, which would be: “To whom are you bringing it.” [Rashi knows this] because it says afterward, “You should say, ‘They belong to your servant, Yaakov.’” This is answering Eisov’s first question first, as Rashi explains there. But if the first @hh<HEB>למי@ee<ENG> conveyed its simple meaning, then it should say afterward, “To my master, Eisov” — for that would be the answer to Eisov’s [first] question. @p1[19]@p2<TIE>Referring to Yaakov.@p3 [How does Rashi know this? Because] it is written, “He commanded the first one<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. and to all who followed after<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>..” If so, the last one also said, “He is also behind us” — although there was no [group] behind him. Perforce, it referred to Yaakov. Consequently, all [the groups must have meant] the same. [You might ask: If so,] why does it then say, “You should also say, ‘See, your servant Yaakov is behind us”? [This is repetitious, as] all the servants already said this! The answer is: Yaakov was saying to them as follows. Regarding what I commanded you to say to Eisov — “And see, he is also behind us” — do not say it vaguely, by concealing my name. Rather, say it expressly, like this: “See, your @ITservant Yaakov@it is behind us.” I.e., mention to him [also my] servility.<QC>
@p1[22]@p2<TIE>He was also angry that he had to resort to all this.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because it is written @hh<HEB>על פניו@ee<ENG> — similar to @hh<HEB>על אפו@ee<ENG> (in his anger) — instead of @hh<HEB>לפניו@ee<ENG>. (@ITGur Aryeh@it) @p1[23]@p2<TIE>Where was Deenah?@p3 You might ask: How does Rashi know this? Perhaps Deenah was among the eleven, and one of the sons was missing. The answer is: It is written in v. 43:29, “Hashem be @ITgracious@it to you, my son.” Yoseif said this to Binyamin. And, as Rashi explains, Yoseif blessed him so because for the other brothers it had already been said (v. 33:5), “The children whom Hashem has @ITgraciously@it granted your servant”. [Yaakov said this to Eisov when they met.] Since Binyomin was not yet born at that time, Yoseif blessed him now with grace. This clearly shows that “his eleven children” were the eleven sons, without Deenah. For otherwise, the question stands: why did Yoseif bless only Binyomin with grace, and not the other son who was missing at the time [that Yaakov met Eisov]? @p1@p2So that Eisov could not set eyes on her.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., for this reason we must say that it was Deenah who was missing, and that Yaakov placed her in a box because of Eisov. For otherwise, why was Yaakov punished through Deenah [i.e., the episode with Shechem]? Perforce, he was punished because he feared Eisov, and Yaakov therefore put her in a box. And this answers the question in the previous entry. @p1@p2Yaakov was thus punished.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 You might ask: It is written in v. 35:1, “Arise, go up to Beis Eil,” on which Rashi explains, “Because you lingered on your journey you have been punished and this trouble of your daughter has come to you.” [Does this not imply that Yaakov was not punished for withholding Deenah?] The answer is: Each of thee matters caused [Yaakov’s punishment]. @p1[24]@p2<TIE>The cattle and movable property. He acted as a bridge.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [How does Rashi know he acted as a bridge? The answer is:] Scripture writes [only once] that he “crossed over the ford of the Yabbok.” Otherwise [i.e., if he did not act as a bridge] Scripture should have written that he crossed back to where his wives were, before saying, “He took them<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>..” [Perforce, he merely stretched his arms back over the river.] Another answer is: Rashi deduced this because it is written, “He @ITtook@it them and crossed them,” instead of simply saying, “He crossed them.” Perforce, he acted as a bridge. @p1[25]@p2<TIE>He had forgotten some small jars and he returned for them.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because he had already brought over all the important utensils, as it is written, “He brought over all that he possessed.” It does not mean literally jars, as all unimportant utensils are called @hh<HEB>פכים@ee<ENG>. Much has been said on this in @ITGur Aryeh@it and @ITR. Noson@it, but Rashi explained it this way in @ITChulin@it 91a. (@ITKitzur Mizrachi@it) @p1@p2Our Sages have explained that this was Eisov’s guardian angel.@p3 Rashi proves this on, “If I have found favor in your eyes<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. like seeing the face of a Godly being” (33:10). @ITMaharshal@it writes: You might ask: What caused Rashi make the forced explanation that @hh<HEB>ויאבק@ee<ENG> is of Aramaic origin, instead of saying like Menachem did? The answer is: It is because our Sages say that this was Eisov’s guardian angel. [And it says in Chulin 91a that according to the view that they kicked up dust,] they raised dust until the Throne of Glory. But Eisov’s guardian angel, [could not reach such a lofty level]. @p1[27]@p2<TIE>Concede to me the blessings with which my father blessed me.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 You might ask: Perhaps Yaakov requested that he actually bless him? The answer is: The angel replied, “No longer will your name be spoken of as Yaakov.” How did this answer [Yaakov’s request]? Perforce, the angel’s answer means as Rashi explains: “It will no longer be said that the blessings came to you through deceit and trickery.” This implies that Yaakov had requested for a concession to the blessings, and the angel replied accordingly. (@ITRe’m@it) @p1[29]@p2<TIE>God will reveal Himself to you in Beis Eil, and change your name.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., the angel did not change Yaakov’s name here. Rather, he told Yaakov that Hashem will change his name in the future, and he said that he will interpret the change [of his name] that Hashem will make as applying to the blessings. @p1[30]@p2<TIE>We do not have a set name. Our names keep changing.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., he was not angry when Yaakov asked this. [And how does Rashi know?] Because the angel asked Yaakov the same question.<QC>
@p1[32]@p2<TIE>Those hours that the sun prematurely set .<TIE>.<TIE>. it prematurely rose for him.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Even if we say that the sun shone for him [to heal him], did it shine only “for him”? @p1@p2He was limping when the sun rose.@p3 Rashi is saying he was limping when the sun began to rise, but he was cured right afterward. @p1[4]@p2<TIE>There are those who explained these dots as saying that he did not kiss him wholeheartedly.@p3 Meaning: @hh<HEB>וישקהו@ee<ENG> has dots on all letters except the @hh<HEB>ש@ee<ENG>. Thus it is as if it is written @hh<HEB>ויקהו@ee<ENG>, as in @hh<HEB>הקהה את שיניו@ee<ENG> (blunt his teeth — Pesach Haggadah). This is because he intended to bite him. @p1[5]@p2<TIE>Who are these that they should be yours?@p3 Rashi is answering the question: “Who are these” implies that Eisov did not know to whom they belonged. Why did he then say, “To you”? Thus Rashi explains, “That they should be yours.” I.e., are they your sons, servants or hirelings? @p1[8]@p2<TIE>Who is this entire camp that I have met.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi says this because] @hh<HEB>מי לך@ee<ENG> cannot mean the same as in v. 5, “Who are these to you,” where it meant: “Are they your servants or your sons?” For here, Eisov knew they were the gift-bearers, and surely they were Yaakov’s servants. Furthermore, why would Yaakov reply, “It was to find favor in the eyes of my master”? Perforce, Eisov was asking: “What is its purpose to you?” In other words, “Why did you go to all this trouble?” But @ITMaharshal@it writes that @hh<HEB>מי לך@ee<ENG> means, “Whose are they?” You might object: If so, why did Yaakov reply, “It was to find favor in your eyes”? Should he not have replied first that they were his? The answer is: Eisov was asking, “To whom belongs this entire camp that I should inquire of him, “For what purpose did you send it?” Yaakov replied, “It was to find favor in your eyes,” as Eisov’s main inquiry was about the gift’s purpose. @p1@p2The Midrashic explanation is: He met up with groups of angels.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because otherwise, what does “that whole camp” mean? The gift-bearers were only five servants! [You might ask: According to the Midrash,] why did Yaakov answer, “It was to find favor in the eyes of my master”? Will Yaakov find favor in Eisov’s eyes because the angels hit him? The answer is: When Eisov’s people said, “He is Yaakov’s brother,” the angels paid attention. This demonstrated how important Yaakov was in the angels’ eyes, and Yaakov thereby found favor in Eisov’s eyes. In other words, [the angels were] informing Eisov that Yaakov has many friends and allies, and you, too, should be among them. @p1[9]@p2<TIE>Here, he conceded the blessings to him.@p3 Rashi deduced this from the extra phrase, “Let what you have remain yours.” “I have plenty,” would have sufficed. @p1[10]@p2<TIE>Do not tell me this.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because @hh<HEB>אַל@ee<ENG> always prefaces an order [not to do something]. Thus Rashi explains it as, “Please do not tell me this.” [Rashi is also explaining] that we should not think that “Please no” relates to Eisov’s concession of the blessings, as that cannot be. Rather, “Please no” relates only to Eisov’s statement that he has plenty and does not want the gift. (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1@p2For it is right and proper for you to accept my gift.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi adds, “It is right and proper<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” since @hh<HEB>על כן@ee<ENG> means “because.” [Consequently, @hh<HEB>על כן@ee<ENG> means the same as @hh<HEB>כי@ee<ENG>.] If so, one of them should have sufficed: either @hh<HEB>על כן ראיתי פניך@ee<ENG>, or @hh<HEB>כי ראיתי פניך@ee<ENG>. Therefore Rashi added, “For it is right<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” so that @hh<HEB>כי@ee<ENG> gives the reason for the preceding statement, “Take my present from my hand.” It is as if Yaakov said, “Take my present from my hand @ITbecause@it (@hh<HEB>כי@ee<ENG>) it is right and proper for you to accept it.” Whereas @hh<HEB>על כן@ee<ENG> connects to [what follows:] “@ITBecause@it I have seen your face.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1@p2Which is esteemed to me like seeing the face of an angel for I have seen your guardian angel.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi is explaining that] when it says, “Like seeing,” it does not mean: “I have seen your face, @ITlike@it I saw the face of a Godly being.” For that would not be a reason to give Eisov a gift. Thus Rashi explains, “Which is @ITesteemed@it to me like seeing<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1@p2You have become reconciled to me.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is saying that the @hh<HEB>ו@ee<ENG> of @hb<HEB>ו@hhתרצני@ee<ENG> signifies the idea: @IT“and there is another@it reason to receive the gift.” Otherwise, @hh<HEB>ותרצני@ee<ENG> [is not understandable, as] it does not relate to @hh<HEB>ראות פני אלהים@ee<ENG>.<QC>
@p1[11]@p2<TIE>You did not need to exert yourself for it, whereas I toiled<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., since you did not exert yourself over it like I did, it is fitting that you accept it. “Until it has come into your hand” means: until this time when it has already come into your hand. @p1[12]@p2<TIE>The same as @HB<HEB>נְסַע@BO<ENG> with the @HB<HEB>נ@BO<ENG> being part of the root<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 It is like @hh<HEB>שְׁמָעָה@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>סְלָחָה@ee<ENG>, where the @hh<HEB>ש@ee<ENG> [and @hh<HEB>ס@ee<ENG>] is from the root, and the @hh<HEB>ה@ee<ENG> is added. Here too, the @hh<HEB>נ@ee<ENG> is from the root and the @hh<HEB>ה@ee<ENG> is added. It is a simple verb; [the @hh<HEB>נ@ee<ENG> is] not from the reflexive form. Neither is the @hh<HEB>נ@ee<ENG> from the prefix letters @hh<HEB>ה, א, י, ת, נ@ee<ENG>, [in which case it would mean, “Let us go.”] For if so, there should be two @hh<HEB>נ@ee<ENG>, one for the root and one for the prefix, and Scripture should have written @hh<HEB>ננסעה@ee<ENG>. (@ITRe’m@it) @p1@p2The translation of Onkelos @HB<HEB>טול ונהך@BO<ENG>. @boI.e., Onkelos is also a proof to this point. For he does not translate @hh<HEB>נסעה@ee<ENG> as @hh<HEB>נטל@ee<ENG> (“Let us go”), but as @hh<HEB>טול@ee<ENG>, implying it is a noun [meaning “going”]. Whereas @hh<HEB>נלכה@ee<ENG>, which refers to both Eisov [and Yaakov], Onkelos translates as @hh<HEB>ונהך@ee<ENG>. @p1[14]@p2<TIE>Please do not extend the length of your trip<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is saying: It does not mean Eisov should go in front, with Yaakov following.<QC>
@p1@p2According to the requirement of the pace of the feet of the work.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi is saying that] the @hh<HEB>ל@ee<ENG> of @hb<HEB>ל@hhרגל@ee<ENG> conveys @hb<HEB>כפי@hh רגל@ee<ENG> (“according to the feet”). Accordingly, [with Rashi’s addition of, “Of the pace,”] the verse means: according to the ability of the feet @ITto move@it, rather than according to the fact that they are feet. @p1[15]@p2<TIE>Do you do this favor for me for which I have no need.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: @hh<HEB>למה זה אמצא חן@ee<ENG> seems to imply that Yaakov did not want to find favor. But did he not send a large gift in order to find favor in Eisov’s eyes? Thus Rashi explains it as, “For what do you do this favor?” Whereas “Let me find favor in your eyes” is a separate statement. @p1[16]@p2<TIE>Eisov alone. Whereas the four hundred men that had gone with him slipped away<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 You might object: Although Eisov alone is mentioned in the verse, his men are tacitly included, for the verse speaks of the primary figure. [And the proof is that] the next verse says, “Yaakov traveled to Sukkos,” which includes Yaakov’s wives and children. Why does the same not apply here? The answer is: Eisov said, “Let me leave some of the people with you,” and we might mistakenly think that they indeed stayed with Yaakov. Thus, it should be clearly written that they went with Eisov, [if in fact they did]. (@ITRe’m@it) Another answer: It is written in v. 1, “He saw Eisov was coming, and with him, four hundred men.” Since the verse [specially] mentions the four hundred men, it is implied that Eisov was secondary to them. Accordingly, our verse should have mentioned them, too. But this is not the case with Yaakov. @p1[17]@p2<TIE>He stayed there eighteen months; a summer, a winter, and a summer.@p3 @ITRe’m@it objects: “I do not know why Rashi cites this Midrash [which does not fit with the simple meaning of the verse.] The house and the shelters were all [used] at the same time—the house by Yaakov, and the shelters by his animals—as the verse states. And Rashi writes [in many places], ‘My intention is only to explain the simple meaning.’” @ITMaharshal@it answers: Scripture wrote @hh<HEB>סכות@ee<ENG> twice, and @hh<HEB>בית@ee<ENG> once, indicating that “@hh<HEB>סכות@ee<ENG> is one summer, @hh<HEB>בית@ee<ENG> is a winter<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” The @ITKitzur Mizrachi@it answers: Rashi cites this Midrash in order to corroborate the twenty-two years in which Yaakov did not fulfill the mitzvah of honoring his parents, mentioned by Rashi in @ITParshas Vayeishev@it (37:34). @p1[18]@p2<TIE>Safe in body, for he was healed from his lameness.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because it is written @hh<HEB>שלם@ee<ENG>, without specifying [in which way he was whole], implying he was whole in all ways. And [aside from lameness,] what is written in this vein? Before, it said he had property. And now it says, “He bought the part of the field,” implying he [still] had money. And whole in his Torah [knowledge] is learned from, “When he came from Padan Aram.” Why was this [phrase written]? To teach that even though he came from Padan Aram, which is utterly ignorant of Torah, he did not forget what he had learned. (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1[20]@p2<TIE>Our Sages interpret that it was God who called Yaakov<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 It is as if it said @hh<HEB>ויקרא אלקי ישראל ליעקב אל@ee<ENG>. I.e., Hashem is the Almighty above, and so is Yaakov below. Why? Because the Divine Presence rests on earth because of Yaakov — thus it is considered as if he was the Almighty. @p1[7]@p2<TIE>For the gentiles constrained themselves from illicit relationships as a result of the Flood.@p3 And one who transgresses is sentenced to death. So did they accept upon themselves, as Rashi mentioned in Parshas Chayei Sarah [24:16]. Although this was beyond the requirement of the law [i.e., to be sentenced to death in a case where the woman is unmarried]. And so too, the expression @hh<HEB>גדרו עצמן@ee<ENG> implies: they constrained themselves, although Hashem did not command it. @ITNachalas Yaakov@it objected to this answer: The prohibition on unmarried women was merely a constraint and decree that the descendants of Noach [placed upon themselves. If so,] why was Shechem liable for death? The Rambam says because of robbery, and the Ramban says because of Shechem’s various evil deeds, [but no one says that he was liable to be executed for engaging in illicit relations]. And Rashi does not mention the above reasons because he is not seeking to explain why Shechem was liable for death, but to explain that “Such a thing should not be done” even with an unmarried woman. This raises the question of @ITRe’m@it: [“Is not an unmarried woman permitted to the descendants of Noach?”] to which Rashi answers, “For the gentiles constrained themselves<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>..” See there for elaboration. [An alternate approach:] You might ask: Is not an unmarried woman permitted to the descendants of Noach? The answer is: Since Shechem kidnapped her and thereby had relations with her, it is considered like illicit relations. Thus, he was liable to be executed. (@ITRe’m@it)<QC>
@p1[15]@p2<TIE>Will we be reconciled with you.@p3 Rashi is saying that @hh<HEB>נאות@ee<ENG> does not mean @hh<HEB>נויה@ee<ENG> (beauty) or @hh<HEB>נאוה@ee<ENG> (habitation). For if so, in v. 22 it should not have written @hh<HEB>יאותו לנו@ee<ENG> but @hh<HEB>ינאו לנו@ee<ENG>, which is the correct conjugation for @hh<HEB>נוי@ee<ENG>. @p1@p2To be circumcised.@p3 I.e., it is in the passive form, not the active. This is because the root is @hh<HEB>מול@ee<ENG>, and if [it was active] it would be written @hh<HEB>לָמול@ee<ENG>. And if the root is @hh<HEB>נמל@ee<ENG>, then it would be written @hh<HEB>לִנְמוֹל@ee<ENG>.<QC>
@p1[23]@p2<TIE>To this matter and, as a result, they will settle with us.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: The verse seems to imply<QC>
@p3that the sons of Yaakov asked for consent to live with them. But it was just the opposite! @p1[25]@p2<TIE>Shimon and Leivi acted as other people.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi knows this because Scripture should have just said, “Shimon and Leivi.” Why is it [also] written, “Two of Yaakov’s sons”? Thus Rashi explains as he does. (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1@p2Because they risked their lives for her.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because otherwise, why does it say, “Brothers of Deenah?” Perforce, it tells us that they acted out of brotherhood and not because they were violent.<QC>
@p1@p2The Aggadaic explanation is: They were confident of the power of the “old one.”@p3 This refers to Yaakov. Alternatively, [it refers to Avraham. They were confident] of Avraham’s prayer for them, as explained in Parshas Lech Lecha (12:10). (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1[29]@p2<TIE>From the term @HB<HEB>שבייה@BO<ENG>. The accent is, therefore, on the latter syllable.@p3 But if the accent was on the first syllable, like with @hh<HEB>קמו@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>שבו@ee<ENG>, the root would be @hh<HEB>שוב@ee<ENG>. Then it would mean “returning.”<QC>
@p1[30]@p2<TIE>“When your numbers will increase, then will you inherit the land.”@p3 This is a verse in Parshas Mishpatim (Shemos 23:30). It implies: after you are fruitful and multiply, then you will inherit. @p1@p2They had, therefore, been silent.@p3 But now they will think the time has come, and they will attack us. @p1[31]@p2<TIE>Abandoned.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Only a woman who @ITwillingly@it abandons herself to relations with any man is called a harlot. If so, how could Shechem possibly make her a harlot, when she did not willingly abandon herself? Thus Rashi explains [that here it means] “abandoned.” I.e., Shechem acted as if she was [property that has been] abandoned. @p1@p2To our sister.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Perhaps @hh<HEB>הכזונה@ee<ENG> should be interpreted as missing a @hh<HEB>ב@ee<ENG>, as if it said @hh<HEB>הכ@hbב@hhזונה עשה את אחותינו@ee<ENG>? Then it would mean, “Should he do @ITwith@it our sister as one does @ITwith@it a harlot?” Accordingly, @hh<HEB>זונה@ee<ENG> would indeed mean harlot, [contrary to Rashi’s explanation of “abandoned”]. Therefore Rashi cites Onkelos who translates [@hh<HEB>את@ee<ENG> as] @hh<HEB>ית@ee<ENG>, proving that it does not mean “with.” This explains why Rashi said that @hh<HEB>הכזונה@ee<ENG> means “abandoned.” @p1[1]@p2<TIE>Because you lingered on your journey you have been punished<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because otherwise, why did Hashem need to command him, “Arise, go up [to Beis Eil]”? Yaakov had already vowed to do this! Perforce, Hashem was telling him: Go up quickly and linger no longer. But Yaakov was not punished for lingering in Lavan’s house, because the vow went into effect only when he began to return [home]. For it is written [when he made his vow], “And if I return in peace<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (28:21).<QC>
@p1[4]@p2<TIE>A kind of non-fruit bearing tree.@p3 I.e., it does not produce fruits. @hh<HEB>סרק@ee<ENG> means @hh<HEB>רֵק@ee<ENG> (empty) of fruit. Yaakov did not want the delay of bringing the idols to the Dead Sea, [the normal way to dispose of such objects,] because he was hurrying to fulfill his vow. So he innovated [a quicker method] and buried them in the ground. And he buried them under a non-fruit bearing tree, [where people do not go,] so no one will notice later that the ground had been dug up. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it)<QC>
@p1[7]@p2<TIE>God is in Beis Eil.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows] that @hh<HEB>אל@ee<ENG> [means “God,”, and] is not a preposition [meaning “to”], because its vowel is a @hh<HEB>צירה@ee<ENG>. Also, its @ITtropp@it is a @hh<HEB>טפחא@ee<ENG>, indicates that it is disconnected [from the following word].<QC>
@p1[8]@p2<TIE>The plain of Beis Eil was called Allon.@p3 Rashi is saying that Allon does not mean “plain.” Rather, Allon is the name of the plain, as Rashi explains in Parshas Lech Lecha, on @hh<HEB>איל פארן@ee<ENG> (14:6). See there. @p1@p2He was told that his mother had died.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because she did not die earlier, for she sent Devorah to Yaakov, indicating that she had not yet died. However, when Yaakov comes to his father’s house it is written only (v. 27), “Yaakov came to Yitzchok his father,” omitting, “To Rivkah his mother.” Yet, Yaakov came because Rivkah had sent Devorah to him! This implies that Rivkah had [just] died. And since Yaakov now received tidings of a second mourning, as it is written @hh<HEB>אלון בכות@ee<ENG>, which means “another mourning,” perforce he was informed of his mother’s death. @p1@p2It is for the following reason that the date of her death was kept secret so that.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., Yitzchak was confined to his home due to blindness. And Yaakov was in [transit from] Padan Aram. The only one still with Rivkah was Eisov. Thus the day of her death was kept secret, so that Eisov should not be involved with her burial, for this would cause people to curse the womb from which he came. Some ask: Why would people curse her after her death more than during her life? The answer is: Before her death, people did not see Eisov since he was with his father-in-law in Seir, for that is where Yaakov sent his gift to Eisov. But now, if he would be the only one to come and bury her, people would curse her. @ITMaharshal@it answers: Her death was kept secret so people would think she was still alive, and they would not be permitted to curse her due to, “You shall not curse a deaf person” (Vayikra 19:14). But this applies only to a live person, [and to the non-deaf as well. See Rashi there]. @p1[10]@p2<TIE>A term denoting a person who comes in ambush and deceit.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 @hh<HEB>מארב@ee<ENG> means as in @hb<HEB>וארב@hh וקם עליו@ee<ENG>, “And will ambush him, arising against him” (Devarim 19:11). @p1[11]@p2<TIE>I have the power to bless because the blessings are Mine.@p3 Rashi is answering the questions: Why does it say @hh<HEB>אני@ee<ENG>? And why does it say @hh<HEB>שדי@ee<ENG>, rather than another Name? @p1@p2Menasheh and Ephraim.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 @ITRe’m@it writes that the Rashi text should read: “@hh<HEB>וקהל גוים@ee<ENG>. This refers to Menasheh and Ephraim.” [I.e., adding @hh<HEB>וקהל@ee<ENG>]. For Rashi interprets @hh<HEB>גוי@ee<ENG> as one son, and @hh<HEB>וקהל גוים@ee<ENG> as another son. Otherwise, the question arises: Why does Rashi say on 48:4, “Hashem informed me that there would yet emanate from me @hh<HEB>קהל @ee@hhו@ee@hhעמים@ee<ENG>,” [referring to Menasheh and Ephraim]? Alternatively, Rashi’s text on 48:4 should read @hh<HEB>קהל עמים@ee<ENG>, deleting the @hh<HEB>ו@ee<ENG>. And here, the text reads @hh<HEB>גוים@ee<ENG> [without @hh<HEB>וקהל@ee<ENG>. And the word @hh<HEB>גוים@ee<ENG>, which is plural, implies two sons] Menashe and Ephraim. But see the @ITGur Aryeh@it on 48:4, who [writes that the @ITRe’m@it unnecessarily] alters the Rashi text. @p1@p2Shaul and Ish Boshes who were from the tribe of Binyamin.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is saying, that which is written “Kings will come out of your loins,” implies that they were still in his loins—and this could only refer to the tribe of Binyamin, who had not yet been born.<QC>
@p1[14]@p2<TIE>I do not know what this teaches us.@p3 [Note: Rashi’s comment relates to v. 13.] Bereishis Rabboh derives from this verse that the Patriarchs are the @hh<HEB>מרכבה@ee<ENG> (seat and vehicle of Hashem’s Presence). And Rashi holds of this exposition, as he cited it on 17:22. Nevertheless, Rashi still holds that “At the place where He had spoken to him” is superfluous. For regarding Avraham it is written (17:22), “Elohim ascended from Avraham.” [And it teaches that the Patriarchs are the @hh<HEB>מרכבה@ee<ENG>,] even though it does not conclude, “At the place where He had spoken to him.”<QC>
@p1[16]@p2<TIE>Plowing is prevalent the winter has passed — and the hot weather has not yet arrived.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi is saying that] even though the time was good [for traveling], so Yaakov should not have buried her on the road but rather he should have brought her to Ephros, nonetheless he did not do so. This is as Rashi explains in Parshas Vayechi (48:7). However, Rashi explains there that “it was the dry season,” implying it was the middle of summer. Therefore, perhaps Yaakov did not bring her for burial in [the settled part of] Eretz Yisrael because it was too hot [to travel]? The answer is: When Rashi said there that “it was the dry season when the earth is riddled with holes<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” he did not mean that it was in the middle of summer. Rather, he meant the beginning of summer when the earth is riddled with holes from the blade of the plow, because plowing is prevalent. @p1@p2However, this is not the plain meaning of the verse, for concerning Na’aman we find<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., what would Scripture gain there by teaching that the earth was like a sieve and the winter had passed and the hot weather had not yet arrived? What difference would it make? Perforce, @hh<HEB>כברת ארץ@ee<ENG> means it was a short distance, and Geichazi immediately ran after Na’aman [and caught up with him]. @p1@p2Just as you say @HB<HEB>צמד@ee@BO<ENG> of vineyards, @HB<HEB>חלקה@BO<ENG> of a field.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 In other words, when one sells a vineyard to another, he says to him, “I am selling you a @hh<HEB>צמד@ee<ENG> of vineyards.” And when he sells him a field he says to him, “[ I am selling you] a @hh<HEB>חלקה@ee<ENG> of a field.” I.e., this was the known measurement for them.<QC>
@p1[22]@p2<TIE>Prior to his coming to Chevron to Yitzchok.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., all this happened to him because he delayed coming to his father Yitzchok. @p1@p2Yaakov took his bed<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. and placed it in Bilhah’s tent<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 This was because Bilhah was Rachel’s handmaiden. You might ask: Why did Yaakov do this? Why did he not place it in Leah’s tent? The answer is: Yaakov did not place his bed in Leah’s tent when Rachel was alive, so he reasoned that Leah would not want to accept it now. But Reuven, who regularly spent time with his mother, knew she would accept it. Therefore he went and disturbed the sleeping arrangement. (@ITMaharshal@it)<QC>
@p1[23]@p2<TIE>The firstborn in inheritance; the firstborn in Divine Service.@p3 I.e., when the Kohen Gadol performed the Divine Service, he would wear the @ITchoshen@it and @ITephod.@it The names of the Tribes were on the @ITchoshen@it and the shoulder straps of the @ITephod.@it Reuvein[’s name] appeared first. @p1@p2The firstborn in enumeration<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 When the names of the Tribes are enumerated, Reuvein is counted first. @p1[27]@p2<TIE>The name of the plain.@p3 But is it not written in Parshas@IT@it Lech Lecha (13:18), “And he settled in @hh<HEB>אלוני ממרא@ee<ENG> which is in Chevron,” on which Rashi explains that @hh<HEB>ממרא@ee<ENG> is the name of a person? The answer is: There it is written @hh<HEB>באלוני ממרא@ee<ENG>, and @hh<HEB>אלון@ee<ENG> is itself the name of the plain. [Perforce, there it means, “The @hh<HEB>אלון@ee<ENG> of the person named @hh<HEB>ממרא@ee<ENG>.”] We should not object that perhaps the plain has two names, @hh<HEB>אלון@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>ממרא@ee<ENG>, and there it was called by both its names. Because then it should have said @hh<HEB>באלוני @hbב@hhממרא@ee<ENG>, to show that the plain has two names. Since it is not written in this manner, @hh<HEB>ממרא@ee<ENG> must be the name of a person. @ITRe’m@it explains that here, @hh<HEB>ממרא@ee<ENG> cannot be the name of a person, because it is written afterwards @hh<HEB>קרית הארבע@ee<ENG>, which refers to the place. @p1@p2The name of the city.@p3 Rashi is saying that the city’s name is Kiryas Arba, and it does not mean, “The kiryah (city) of the person named Arba.” For it is written (23:2) @hh<HEB>ותמת שרה בקרית ארבע היא חברון@ee<ENG>, [and not @hh<HEB>ותמת שרה בחברון קרית ארבע@ee<ENG>]. This shows that Kiryas Arba is the name of the place. The @hh<HEB>ה@ee<ENG> of @hh<HEB>הארבע@ee<ENG> in this verse is in place of @hh<HEB>של@ee<ENG> (of). Thus it means, “The plain @ITof@it Kiryas Arba,” as Rashi himself goes on to explain.<QC>
@p1[2]@p2<TIE>In order to mislead his father.@p3 Question: Why did Eisov not call Bosmas, [too,] by a good name in order to trick his father? In Parshas Toldos (26:34), it should have mentioned that name, if she had it. The answer is: Eisov indeed called her by another, non-idolatry name. But [in Parshas Toldos], Scripture itself calls her Bosmas, denoting idolatry. This is because Scripture goes on to say (27:1), “Yitzchok’s eyesight faded and he could not see.” Rashi there explains that this was due to the smoke of these wives [who burned incense to idols]. And if Scripture would have called her by a different name there, we would ask: Where do we find [any hint] that they burned incense [to idols]? Thus Scripture calls her by the name of Bosmas (incense), to indicate this. See there. (@ITMaharshal@it) [You might ask]: Yehudis was the daughter of Be’eri the Chittite (26:34), while Oholivomoh was the daughter of Anoh the Chivite, [as it says here. How then could Rashi say that Yehudis and Oholivomoh are the same? The answer is:] Anoh and Be’eri is the same person with two names. Although Scripture connects him here to the Chivites and there to the Chittites, it is possible that his father was a Chittite, and his mother, a Chivite. You might ask: How does Rashi know that Yehudis is Oholivomoh? Perhaps Yehudis died, and Oholivomoh is another wife? @ITRe’m@it answers: Because it is written, “Eisov took his wives,” rather than, “Eisov took wives.” This implies they were the same wives who were mentioned before. @p1[5]@p2<TIE>This Korach was of illegitimate birth and was fathered by Eliphaz.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 @ITRe’m@it asks: How does Rashi know this? Perhaps there were two Korachs. He answers: Korach is not mentioned among Eliphaz’s sons but among Oholivomoh’s sons, [implying he was not publicly known as Eliphaz’s son]. Yet later, he is mentioned among the chiefs of Eliphaz. This implies he was of illegitimate birth. @p1[6]@p2<TIE>To reside wherever he might find.@p3 Otherwise, why does it not mention to which land he went?<QC>
@p1[7]@p2<TIE>Due to the shame that he sold his birthright.@p3 Rashi is saying: This is an additional reason [for his leaving].<QC>
@p1[12]@p2<TIE>She said: “I may not merit being married to you, but, if only I could be your concubine.”@p3 Otherwise, why does it say, “Timna became a concubine<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”? It should just say that Amalek, too, was among Eliphaz’s sons. Why was his mother’s name mentioned, over and above that of Eliphaz’s other sons? Also, what difference does it make if she was Eliphaz’s concubine or his wife? Therefore Rashi explains, “This is to inform us<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. if only I could be your concubine<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” And therefore Rashi explains [on v. 24] that this is why the Torah had to write the families of the Chorites in vs. 29—30. (@ITR. Meir Stern@it) @p1@p2Indicating that he came upon Seir’s wife.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 @ITRe’m@it asks: How does Rashi know that Timna was an illegitimate child? Perhaps Eliphaz took Seir’s wife after Seir’s demise, and begat Timna from her. @ITMaharshal@it answers: If so, how could Eliphaz’s own daughter publicly become his concubine? But it is understandable if Eliphaz illicitly came upon Seir’s wife, as people would not know that Timna was Eliphaz’s daughter. But it seems to me [that the answer is:] that if Timna was Eliphaz’s [legitimate] daughter, why does it say, “Lotan’s sister was Timna”? It is understandable if she was Eliphaz’s illicit daughter, as people would assume she was Seir’s daughter and thus Lotan’s full sister. And Scripture would be informing us of the greatness of Avraham, [for the sister of Chief Lotan became a concubine to Eliphaz]. But if Eliphaz legitimately begat Timna, and then took her as a concubine because a @ITben Noach@it is [technically] permitted to his daughter, why does the verse tell us she was Lotan’s sister? To inform us of Avraham’s greatness? [This cannot be,] because she anyway was known to all as Avraham’s descendant. For Eliphaz legitimately took Seir’s [former] wife and begat Timna from her. @ITRe’m@it answers: All these families were written here only to tell of their shame and illegitimacy. So wherever the opportunity arises, we attribute it to [their] illicitness. @p1[15]@p2<TIE>Heads of families.@p3 Rashi is saying they were leaders and heads, each over a different family, but not that the families were formed by them.<QC>
@p1[24]@p2<TIE>Indicating that Tzivon came upon his mother and bore Anoh.@p3 You might ask: How does Rashi know that Tzivon came upon his mother, Seir’s wife? Perhaps Seir, Tzivon’s father, came upon Tzivon’s wife and begat Anoh from her. And people thought Anoh was Tzivon’s son, but Anoh was in fact Seir’s son and Tzivon’s brother. The answer is: It is logical to attribute an act of corruption to one who is corrupt. And before we find that Tzivon was corrupt (Rashi, v. 2), as he came upon his daughterin-law, Anoh’s wife. But there is no reason to say that both [Anoh and Seir] were corrupt. You might object: And before, how did Rashi know that Tzivon was corrupt and came upon his daughter-in-law? Perhaps Anoh was the corrupt one and came upon his mother, Tzivon’s wife. The answer is: If so, there still would be two corrupt people—Anoh and Seir. And since we could rather attribute it all to Tzivon, we do so. (@ITRe’m@it) @ITMaharshal@it objects: Why should we consider two women corrupt—Anoh’s wife who was Tzivon’s daughter-in-law, and Seir’s wife who was Tzivon’s mother? [It is possible that Tzivon’s wife was the corrupt one in both incidents.] The answer is: Women are not called corrupt, because they are passive. The man, who does the act, is called corrupt. An alternative answer: Women can say they were forced to have relations. But a man cannot thereby exempt himself, since he is capable of having relations only if he is willing. @p1@p2“No person has ever consulted me about a wound caused by a white mule and lived.”@p3 I.e., R. Chanina was a doctor, and said: “No one ever consulted me about a wound caused by a white mule and I gave him a cure.”<QC>
@p1[31]@p2<TIE>Yaakov established a corresponding number in whose days Eisov’s kingdom ceased<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi means: It is written [about Yaakov and Eisov], “One government will be mightier than the other” (25:23), implying they will not be simultaneously great [see Rashi there]. Thus, when the kings of Yisrael ruled, Eisov’s kingdom ceased that entire period, as Rashi proceeds to explain. @p1@p2About the days of Yoram his son, it is written: “In his days Edom revolted<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”@p3 Since Yoram was at the end, the kingdom of Eisov began immediately in his time. And so too in the time of Shaul who was the first king, the kingdom of Eisov immediately ceased. @p1[33]@p2<TIE>Because it provided a king for Edom it is destined to be smitten together with them.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Why does the verse identify Yovav by his father, if it [also] identifies him by his place? [The place alone should suffice,] as with “Samlah of Masriekah” (v. 36), etc. Rashi answers: Yovav was not well known by his place. Scripture mentions his place only in order to teach, “It is destined to be smitten<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (@ITR. Hendel@it) @p1[40]@p2<TIE>Called by the names of their states.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., when the verse says, “According to their places, by their names,” it means they are named after their places. And lest we object that the chiefs of Eisov were listed before, and furthermore, other [chiefs] are also listed there, Rashi goes on to say: “The previous chiefs<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. are their family names.” The proof that the ones listed here are named after their provinces is that Magdiel is Rome [as Rashi says on v. 43]. For it says in Midrash Rabbah: “[The day that Lotianos became Caesar in Rome,] R. Ami was shown in a dream that today, Magdiel became king.” But from the other ones, such as Chief Kenaz, etc., [there is no proof.] It could be family names, since they were called by these same names even before. And Chief Oholivomoh and Chief Timna seem more likely to be family names, since we saw before that these are names of people. And nothing forces us to say that the others are names of provinces, either. Therefore Rashi brings a proof from Magdiel, which is the name of a place—and so they all are named after their provinces, because Magdiel serves as an example for the others. (@ITR. Meir Stern@it)<QC>
@p1[1]@p2<TIE>After it has written for you concerning the settlements of Eisov and his descendants.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 @ITRe’m@it explains that Rashi is answering the question: Why does Scripture not write first @hh<HEB>ואלה תולדות יעקב.<TIE>.<TIE>.@ee<ENG>, and then @hh<HEB>וישב יעקב.<TIE>.<TIE>.@ee<ENG>, which is the same format that it writes about Eisov. First Eisov’s descendants are enumerated (36:1) and then it tells where they had settled. Rashi answers: “After it has written for you concerning the @ITsettlements@it of Eisov and his descendants.<TIE>.<TIE>.” In other words, Scripture’s purpose is not to enumerate Yaakov’s descendants [as it did with Eisov], but only to explain the @ITsettlements@it of Yaakov and his descendants; and how they settled. [Thus, this section connects to the previous one as regards to settling,] as also the section about Eisov explained his settlement and that of his descendants. For it is written (36:8), “Eisov settled in Mount Seir,” explaining his settlement. Then it describes his descendants, “These are the descendants of Eisov.<TIE>.<TIE>.” and the descendants of his wives. Then it explains the settling of his sons (vs. 40-43), “These are the names of the chiefs of Eisov, each with their families, according to their places.<TIE>.<TIE>. These are the chiefs of Edom according to their places of residence.” Thus for Yaakov, too, Scripture tells about his settlements and that of his descendants, as it is written @hh<HEB>וישב יעקב<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@ee<ENG>, which means, “Yaakov settled.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Then it is written @hh<HEB>אלה תולדות יעקב<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@ee<ENG>, meaning: these are the @ITsettlements@it of the descendants of Yaakov, too, like [Scripture explained regarding] the descendants of Eisov. For at this point the Torah begins to recount what happened to them until they came there [to settle the Land]. It begins with “Yoseif at the age of 17,” then his being sold to Egypt and their enslavement there, then the Exodus — this and that happened to them until they came to settle the Land. @p1[2]@p2<TIE>This is the history of the children of Yaakov.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 This comment of Rashi relates to what he said before, that our verse is explaining the settlements of Yaakov and his descendants. Here, Rashi is answering the question: Where does Scripture explain the settlements of Yaakov’s descendants? It is written @hh<HEB>אלה תולדות יעקב יוסף בן שבע עשרה שנה<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@ee<ENG>, [seemingly a different topic]! Thus Rashi explains that @hh<HEB>אלה תולדות<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@ee<ENG> is about the chain of events leading to the eventual settlement of Yaakov’s descendants, who are the Tribes: Yoseif was seventeen, etc, and because of Yoseif they came to Egypt, after which they left and came to Eretz Yisrael. [Question:] @hh<HEB>אלה תולדות יצחק<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@ee<ENG> (25:19) is similar, in that it begins with @hh<HEB>אלה תולדות@ee<ENG> and then tells the events before their births. Why did Rashi not ask the same question there? The answer is: Rashi’s question here is mainly because it begins with the settlements of Yaakov and then Scripture writes @hh<HEB>אלה תולדות יעקב@ee<ENG>, but the order should have been reversed! @p1@p2These are their settlements, and occurrences.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 @ITRe’m@it explains that Rashi adds, “And occurrences,” because the Torah recounts the actual settlements of only two and a half tribes among Yaakov’s descendants. @p1@p2The Midrash however explains: Scripture identifies Yaakov’s children as Yoseif.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is saying that [according to the Midrash,] the Torah is indeed explaining the descendants of Yaakov, not their settlements. It is written @hh<HEB>אלה תולדות יעקב יוסף@ee<ENG> to convey that all Yaakov’s descendants are called after Yoseif. This is because Yaakov worked the first seven years due to his love for Rochel, to beget a son from her. But then Lavan deceived him and gave him Leah, from whom he begat sons. When Rochel saw that she had no sons, she gave him her maidservant Bilhah as a wife, from whom he begat more sons. Then Leah gave him her maidservant Zilpah as a wife, from whom he begat more sons. And then Rochel gave birth to Yoseif. As soon as Yoseif was born, Yaakov told Lavan that he wished to return to the place of his fathers. Thus we see that all Yaakov’s descendants were due to Yoseif who was born from Rochel. @p1@p2Yaakov’s entire purpose in working for Lavan was only for the sake of Rochel.@p3 You might ask: Binyomin also came from Rochel, so why is [only] Yoseif mentioned? The answer is as I explained before: Yaakov worked mainly for Yoseif, as it says (30:25), “When Rochel had given birth to Yoseif, Yaakov said to Lavan, ‘Send me on my way.<TIE>.<TIE>.’” @p1@p2Yoseif’s @HB<HEB>זיו איקונין@BO<ENG> resembled his.@p3 Why did Rashi not use the term @hh<HEB>קלסתר פנים@ee<ENG>, as he did on 25:19, regarding Yitzchok [who resembled Avraham? The answer is:] Rashi learns Yoseif’s resemblance to Yaakov from the word @hh<HEB>זְקֻנִים@ee<ENG>, as Rashi explains on 37:3. And @hh<HEB>זְקֻנִים@ee<ENG> is an abbreviation for @hh<HEB>זיו אקונין@ee<ENG>. @p1@p2Also, everything that happened to Yaakov happened to Yoseif.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [According to the above Midrash,] the verse is saying, so to speak: “These descendants” about which everyone can testify that they are “of Yaakov,” they are [none other than] “Yoseif,” [for only Yoseif’s facial features resembled Yaakov’s.] This is similar to Rashi’s explanation on (25:19) @hh<HEB>ואלה תולדות יצחק בן אברהם@ee<ENG>, [where everyone testified that Yitzchok looked like Avraham]. Alternatively, the reason why everyone knew Yoseif was Yaakov’s son was that the events which happened to Yaakov happened only to Yoseif, [and a son’s fate generally resembles that of his father]. @p1@p2Another Midrashic exposition: “[Yaakov] settled.” Yaakov was seeking to be settled in tranquility.<TIE>.<TIE>. @boRashi is answering the question: Why is it not written @hb<HEB>ויחי@hh יעקב בארץ.<TIE>.<TIE>.@ee<ENG>, [rather than @hb<HEB>וישב@hh יעקב בארץ.<TIE>.<TIE>.@ee<ENG>]? @p1@p2The righteous seek to be settled in tranquility, God says.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 In all places where Rashi explains that [@hh<HEB>ישב@ee<ENG> implies there was a lacking,] it is because it is written lacking [the @ITvav@it of @hh<HEB>י@hbו@hhשב@ee<ENG>]. Such as @hh<HEB>והוא @hbישב@hh פתח האהל@ee<ENG> (18:1), and @hh<HEB>ולוט @hbישב@ee<ENG> (19:1). But here there is no reason to interpret it as, “Seek to be settled in tranquility,” [since @hh<HEB>וַיֵשֶב@ee<ENG> is not a lacking form of @hh<HEB>יוֹשֵב@ee<ENG>]. Thus, it should literally mean “settled.” [If so, why does Rashi interpret as he does?] The answer is: [This interpretation is needed] because it is written afterwards, @hh<HEB>אלה תולדות יעקב יוסף@ee<ENG>, which has no connection with @hh<HEB>וישב יעקב@ee<ENG>. Alternatively, because it should have said @hh<HEB>אלה תולדות יעקב @hbראובן@hh.<TIE>.<TIE>.@ee<ENG>. This forced Rashi to explain that @hh<HEB>אלה תולדות יעקב יוסף@ee<ENG> is the cause which prevented the fulfillment of Yaakov’s intention [to be settled in tranquility]. And @hh<HEB>קפץ עליו רגזו@ee<ENG> means the controversy and fighting [surrounding Yoseif]. The meaning of @hh<HEB>רגזו@ee<ENG> is similar to @hh<HEB>אל @hbתרגזו@hh בדרך@ee<ENG> (45:24), which Onkelos translates as @hh<HEB>אל תתנצון@ee<ENG> (do not quarrel). (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1@p2He did things that were childish.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Otherwise, why does it say, “And the @ITlad@it”? @p1@p2Meaning that he associated with the sons of Bilhah.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 “With the sons of Bilhah” cannot be [a continuation of] the same point, that he did childish things with the sons of Bilhah. Would he not act the same way when he was not with them? Perforce, [it means, and in addition, he associated with them]. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1@p2Any wrong that he would see in his brothers, the sons of Leah.@p3 Rashi deduces this because it is not written @hb<HEB>ויוצא@hh יוסף דבתם@ee<ENG>, as it is written about the Spies (Bamidbar 13:32), @hb<HEB>ויוציאו@hh דבת הארץ@ee<ENG>. Perforce, the reason it is written here @hb<HEB>ויבא@hh יוסף את דבתם@ee<ENG> is because Yoseif said what was true. I.e., he reported the events to his father according to how he saw and heard them, and he did not say things he did not see. However, with regard to the Spies it is written @hh<HEB>ויוציאו@ee<ENG>, “they brought @BOout@bo,” meaning they brought out [i.e., fabricated] falsehoods from within themselves. @p1@p2In his brothers, the sons of Leah.@p3 [Question:] In the verse it is written just, “With his brothers.” [How does Rashi know it means the sons of Leah?] The answer is: Yoseif was close with the sons of the handmaidens. If he considered them evil, how could he be close with them? Furthermore, since he was their friend, the evil that he reported surely was not about them.<QC>
@p1@p2And that they are suspect in illicit relationships .<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Question: How could the sons of Yaakov have been suspect of doing these things? And if they were suspect, why then was Yoseif punished on account of this? The answer is: They surely were not suspect of doing these things; Yoseif erred. And he was punished because he should have looked further into the matter before suspecting them. He thought they ate limbs of living animals because they ate from a properly slaughtered animal that was still convulsing. But the meat was permitted since it was after @ITshechitah@it. Or, he saw them eating a @ITben pekoa@it [an animal found alive in the womb of its mother that had been properly slaughtered]. It is permitted [to eat it,] due to the @ITshechitah@it of its mother. And even if it [develops into] a big bull it does not require to be ritually slaughtered. [It only needs to be slaughtered] because it @ITappears@it to be forbidden. Yoseif however, considered it as being the limb of a living animal because it nonetheless requires to be ritually slaughtered, due to appearance. They demeaned the sons of the handmaidens by calling the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah “sons of handmaidens.” Although this was true, and even Scripture refers to them so, Yoseif thought it implied that their sons were non-Jewish slaves. But he erred, because their sons were not non-Jewish slaves, for Bilhah and Zilpah were freed women who assisted Rochel and Leah. Regarding illicit relationships: a man may not use another man’s wife to serve him (Kiddushin 70a), and Yoseif saw them using the services or doing business with a married woman, so he suspected them. But he erred, because a man is forbidden to use the services of a married for intimate purpose only, such as washing his face, hands and feet, or making his bed. But, non-intimate matters or doing business with her are permitted. You might ask: How does Rashi know that Yoseif suspected them of all three things? The answer is: Rashi himself answers this by saying, “Yoseif was, in, turn, smitten by these three.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Another answer: There is a connection between @hh<HEB>דבתם @hbרעה@ee<ENG> written here, and v. 33 @hh<HEB>חיה @hbרעה@hh אכלתהו@ee<ENG> (“A wild beast devoured him”). Just like there it involved a limb from a living creature, since a wild beast devours its prey alive, so too here it involved a limb from a living creature. [The matter regarding non-Jewish] slaves is derived from what it is written about a handmaiden in Shemos 21:8: @hh<HEB>אם @hbרעה@hh בעיני אדוניה@ee<ENG>. Just like @hh<HEB>רעה@ee<ENG> there involves slavery, so too here it involves slavery. [The matter regarding] illicit relationships is derived from what it is written in 39:9 regarding Yoseif: @hh<HEB>ואיך אעשה ה@hbרעה@hh הגדולה הזאת@ee<ENG> (“How can I do such a great evil”). Just like @hh<HEB>רעה@ee<ENG> there refers to illicit relationships, so too here it refers to illicit relationships. @p1@p2“They slaughtered a goat” when he was sold, and they did not eat it while it was alive.@p3 I.e., the Torah had no need to write that they slaughtered it, since they did not eat it. Perforce, it comes to tell us that even though they did not intend to eat it, they nonetheless slaughtered it [because they were meticulous about @ITshechitah@it]. @p1[3]@p2<TIE>Because he was born to him in his old age.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 You might ask: Was not Binyamin born in an older age than Yoseif? The answer is: all of Yaakov’s sons were born one right after another, as they were all born within six years — except for Binyamin, whose birth was separated [from Yoseif’s birth] by a long period of time. People had thought that Yaakov would not beget another son from Rochel, so they called Yoseif “son of old age.” And out of habit they continued to do so even after Binyamin was born. @p1@p2Onkelos translates it: “He was a wise son to him.”@p3 [Rashi cites Onkelos] because there is a question on the first explanation: What difference does it make [to us] whether Yoseif was born to Yaakov in his old age or his youth? Thus Rashi says, “Onkelos translates it.<TIE>.<TIE>.” But a question still remains: It should have said @hh<HEB>בן זקנותו@ee<ENG>. Why does it say @hh<HEB>בן זקונים@ee<ENG>? Perforce, it comes to say: “His facial features (@hh<HEB>זיו איקונים@ee<ENG>).<TIE>.<TIE>.” (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1@p2A Midrashic explanation is for his misfortunes .<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi cites this] because there is a question on the first explanation: For what purpose does Scripture say that Yaakov made him a @hh<HEB>כתונת פסים@ee<ENG>? Perhaps to teach, [as it says in Shabbos 10b,] that a person should not treat one son differently than the others, since Yoseif’s brothers were jealous of him because his coat was worth two @ITsela’im@it more. But this is not the simple meaning of the verse, as it is not written, “His brothers @ITsaw @itthat he made him a @hh<HEB>כתונת פסים@ee<ENG>.” Rather, they were jealous of him due to his dreams and words (v. 8). Therefore Rashi cites the Midrashic explanation. (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1@p2That he was sold to Potiphar, traders.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., @hh<HEB>פסים@ee<ENG> is the abbreviation for @hb<HEB>פ@hhוטיפר@ee<ENG>, @hb<HEB>ס@hhוחרים@ee<ENG>, @hb<HEB>י@hhשמעאלים@ee<ENG>, @hb<HEB>מ@hhדינים@ee<ENG>. According to this explanation, the [prefix] @hh<HEB>ו@ee<ENG> is lacking from the word @hh<HEB>סוחרים@ee<ENG> in (37:28): @hh<HEB>וַיַּrַבְרוּ אֲנָשִׁים מִדְיָנִים סֹחֲרִים@ee<ENG>. It should be understood as @hb<HEB>ו@hhסוחרים@ee<ENG> (@ITand@it merchants), [for otherwise it would mean, “Midianite merchants,” and one group would be missing]. Although Scripture omits Yoseif’s sale to the merchants, it also omits his sale to the Midianites, [which surely took place, as they sold him to Potiphar — see v. 36. This understanding of @hh<HEB>סוחרים@ee<ENG> fits the verse well,] because otherwise, why is the word @hh<HEB>סוחרים@ee<ENG> even needed? @p1[7]@p2<TIE>To stand steadfastly straight.@p3 Rashi is explaining the difference between @hh<HEB>קמה@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>נצבה@ee<ENG>, which seem repetitive because they mean the same. Therefore he explains that @hh<HEB>קמה@ee<ENG> means momentarily arising from a lying position, and @hh<HEB>וגם נצבה@ee<ENG> means staying that way, remaining steadfastly straight. (@ITR. Meir Stern@it)<QC>
@p1[10]@p2<TIE>After he had told it to his brothers he retold it to his father in their presence.@p3 You might ask: Why did Yoseif not tell the first dream to his father? The answer is: Yoseif knew that most dreams follow their verbal interpretation, and his brothers interpreted it for the good, so he did not want to tell it to his father. But his brothers did not interpret his second dream for him, as they realized he was telling them his dreams so they will make a good interpretation. Thus he had to tell it to his father so he will interpret it for him. His father did so, and rebuked him so that his brothers would not hate him. (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1@p2Because he was bringing hatred upon himself.@p3 I.e., Yoseif was bringing hatred upon himself. That is why Yaakov rebuked him — not because Yaakov did not want the dream to come true. For it is written in the next verse, “His father kept the matter in mind.” [See Rashi there.] @p1@p2But he did not know that these things were referring to Bilhah who had raised him like his mother.@p3 You might ask: How does Rashi know that Yaakov did not know this? Perhaps Yaakov knew, but he questioned [the dream] for the reason Rashi had given before: that Yoseif should not bring hatred onto himself. @ITRe’m@it <HS><HS>asks [the question this way]: Regarding the explanation of “These things were referring to Bilhah,” Rashi says that Yaakov did not know. But had he known, he would not have said, “Has your mother not already died?” lest his sons realize [that his comment was just a trick]. Yet, regarding the explanation of “No dream is without meaningless things,” why did Yaakov not fear that his sons, too, might know this rule and thus say that his comment was just a trick? @ITMaharshal@it answers: [In the first explanation,] had Yaakov known that these things were referring to Bilhah, his sons surely would have known too, because this is a matter grasped through reasoning. Saying, “Shall I, your mother and your brothers come.<TIE>.<TIE>.” would not make them ignore the matter. But [in the second explanation,] it then says, “His father kept the matter in mind,” because Yaakov had an oral tradition that no dream is without meaningless things. His sons however, did not know this tradition. @p1@p2However, our Sages learned from here that no dream is without meaningless things.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is explaining why Yaakov questioned [the dream] and said, “Shall I, your mother and your brothers come.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Did he not know that no dream is without meaningless things? Perforce, [he said it] “To make his sons ignore.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1@p2But Yaakov intended to make his sons ignore.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., our Sages hold that “your mother” must mean Yoseif’s true mother. However, “No dream is without meaningless things.” @p1[12]@p2<TIE>There are dots on the word @HB<HEB>את@BO<ENG> indicating that they went only to “pasture” themselves.@p3 Rashi means that if there were no dots on @hh<HEB>את@ee<ENG>, it would be connected to @hh<HEB>צאן@ee<ENG>, and mean “to pasture the sheep.” But now that it has dots, it is as if the @hh<HEB>את@ee<ENG> was not written at all. Consequently, @hh<HEB>לרעות@ee<ENG> is not connected to the next word, and means: “They went to pasture.” I.e., to pasture themselves. And @hh<HEB>צאן אביהם בשכם@ee<ENG> is a separate statement. But if @hh<HEB>את@ee<ENG> was completely omitted from the verse, it would not prove the point. Surely we could still say it means “to pasture themselves,” but it would be more logical to say that the words are connected, and form one statement. Thus, although the @hh<HEB>את@ee<ENG> would be omitted, we would say it is an abbreviated verse. But now that @hh<HEB>את@ee<ENG> is written, and it has dots, it is considered as erased. This indicates that the words are not connected; they are rather two statements. Otherwise, why does it have dots?<QC>
@p1[13]@p2<TIE>A term indicating humility and readiness.@p3 You might ask: Why did Rashi not give this explanation on (22:11) @hh<HEB>אברהם אברהם ויאמר @hbהנני@ee<ENG>, and on (Shemos 3:4) @hh<HEB>משה משה ויאמר @hbהנני@ee<ENG>? The answer is: Here, @hh<HEB>הנני@ee<ENG> cannot be a way of answering [when called], as Yaakov was already speaking with him. For it is written, “Yisrael said to Yoseif, ‘Are your brothers not pasturing.<TIE>.<TIE>.’” @p1[14]@p2<TIE>But, is not Chevron on a mountain.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 @ITRe’m@it writes: It seems that this verse was not [@ITChazal’s@it] proof that Chevron was on a mountain. Although it is written, “Went @ITup@it,” this could be because Eretz Yisrael is higher than all the lands, as Rashi explains on, “Hurry, go @ITup@it to my father” (45:9). Rather, @ITRe’m @itexplains, the proof is that Chevron was designated as a burial place. People designate only rocky areas for burial, as it says in Kesubos 112a, and rocky areas are on mountains. An alternate explanation: It is written, “They went @ITup@it and scouted the land.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (Bamidbar 13:21), and then is written (v. 22), “They went @ITup@it into the southern part, and came to Chevron.” Why is it written “they went up” twice? Scripture should simply have written, “They went up into the southern part, and scouted the land.<TIE>.<TIE>. and came to Chevron.” Perforce, “they went up” is repeated because it refers to Chevron, which is on a mountain. So it seems to me.<QC>
@p1@p2A place with a predisposition to misfortunes.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because otherwise it should simply say, “And he came there,” since it is already written, “Pasturing in Shechem.” Perforce, [the name is repeated to imply,] “the notorious Shechem”. [Alternatively, Rashi knows this because] it should simply say, “He sent him from the depths of Chevron, and a man found him.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Perforce, [Shechem is mentioned to imply, “the notorious Shechem”]. (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1[15]@p2<TIE>This refers to Gavriel.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Yoseif did not say to the man, “Do you know my brothers, and where they are pasturing?” Rather, he said [straight away], “Tell me please, where are they pasturing?” This shows it was an angel, [who assumedly knows]. And since Scripture refers to him as @hh<HEB>איש@ee<ENG>, this shows it was specifically Gavriel. [Furthermore,] if it was not an angel, why did the Torah recount the whole story of Yoseif going astray? What does it matter if he went straight there, or strayed? Perforce, it was an angel sent by Hashem to bring him to his brothers, in order to fulfill His decree. For Yoseif otherwise would have turned back from Shechem, as he could not find them. (@ITGur Aryeh@it)<QC>
@p1[17]@p2<TIE>They have removed themselves from brotherhood.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: How does the angel’s reply pertain to Yoseif’s inquiry? Yoseif only requested to be told where they were, while the angel replied, “They have traveled from here.” Furthermore, Yoseif already knew they traveled from there, since he did not find them there. Thus Rashi explains, “They have removed themselves from brotherhood.” I.e., they want to kill you — do not go there. [You might ask:] how does Rashi know it means [specifically] this? The answer is: @hh<HEB>זה@ee<ENG> in @ITgematria@it is twelve. Thus, it means they have moved away from twelve. I.e., they do not want there to be twelve [brothers], rather they want to kill you, and there will be only eleven. Alternatively, Rashi’s proof is that it says, “From this.” In other words, they have moved away “from this” which you say, “I am looking for my @ITbrothers@it.” They, however, have removed themselves from brotherhood. @p1@p2To seek lawful pretexts concerning you.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: The angel said to him @hh<HEB>נסעו מזה@ee<ENG>, meaning: “They have removed themselves from brotherhood.” If so, what is the meaning of, “Because (@hh<HEB>כי@ee<ENG>) I heard them say, ‘Let us go to Doson’”? The word @hh<HEB>כי@ee<ENG> always comes to give a reason. What reason is given here? Thus Rashi explains: lawful pretexts concerning how to kill you. @p1[18]@p2<TIE>Similar to @HB<HEB>אתו@BO<ENG>, with him, meaning toward him. @boRashi is answering the question: How does @hh<HEB>אוֹתוֹ@ee<ENG> fit with @hh<HEB>ויתנכלו@ee<ENG>? The verb @hh<HEB>ויתנכלו@ee<ENG> is reflexive, and means: “They became filled with conspiracies,” thus it does not connect with @hh<HEB>אוֹתוֹ@ee<ENG>. If Scripture had written @hh<HEB>וַיְנַכְלו@ee<ENG>, [a transitive verb,] @hh<HEB>אוֹתוֹ@ee<ENG> would fit. But with @hh<HEB>ויתנכלו@ee<ENG>, the fitting word is @hh<HEB>אליו@ee<ENG>. Thus Rashi explains that @hh<HEB>אוֹתוֹ@ee<ENG> is similar to @hh<HEB>אִתּוֹ@ee<ENG>. Rashi is saying that if we follow how it is written [rather than how it is pronounced,] we would read it @hh<HEB>אִתּוֹ@ee<ENG>, since it is written missing a @hh<HEB>ו@ee<ENG>. Alternatively, [Rashi knows this] because @hh<HEB>אוֹתָנו@ee<ENG> sometimes means @hh<HEB>אִתָנו@ee<ENG>. Thus, @hh<HEB>אוֹתוֹ@ee<ENG> can mean @hh<HEB>אִתּוֹ@ee<ENG>. And @hh<HEB>אִתּוֹ@ee<ENG> means @hh<HEB>עמו@ee<ENG>. And Rashi says, “@hh<HEB>עמו@ee<ENG>, meaning @hh<HEB>אליו@ee<ENG>,” because Onkelos translates @hh<HEB>אליו@ee<ENG> as @hh<HEB>עמו@ee<ENG>; see Rashi on 24:7. Consequently, it is as if the verse said @hh<HEB>אליו@ee<ENG>. (@ITRe’m@it) The @ITMaharshal@it explains that Rashi is answering the question: Why does it say @hh<HEB>ויתנכלו אתו להמיתו@ee<ENG>, rather than simply @hh<HEB>ויתנכלו להמיתו@ee<ENG>? Perforce, @hh<HEB>אוֹתוֹ@ee<ENG> is like @hh<HEB>אִתּוֹ@ee<ENG>, “with him.” Thus it means, “They were plotting @ITwith@it him,” i.e., also Yoseif had in mind that they should kill him. And lest we think it means that he and they had in mind to kill someone else, Rashi says that @hh<HEB>אותו@ee<ENG> also implies @hh<HEB>אליו@ee<ENG>, “toward him” — toward Yoseif. He and they had in mind to kill Yoseif. There is also a varying text of Rashi. @p1[21]@p2<TIE>A blow to the soul, which refers to killing.@p3 Otherwise, how does @hh<HEB>נכנו@ee<ENG> — the object of which is Yoseif — connect to the following word @hh<HEB>נפש@ee<ENG>? Thus Rashi explains that the verse is as if it said @hh<HEB>מכת נפש@ee<ENG>, [which is an adverbial phrase modifying @hh<HEB>נכנו@ee<ENG>]. (@ITR. Meir Stern@it) @p1[22]@p2<TIE>The Divine Spirit testifies concerning Reuvein.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: How could Reuvein himself have said they should throw Yoseif in the pit so he may bring him back to his father? If they knew this, they would not let Reuvein rescue him! Furthermore, if these were Reuvein’s words, it should say, “@ITMy @it<HS><HS>purpose is to rescue.” Why does it say, “@ITHis @itpurpose was to rescue”? @ITRe’m@it comments: I do not understand why Rashi needed to write this. It is selfevident that these are not Reuvein’s words. @p1@p2He thought: “I am the firstborn and the oldest of them all.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 You might ask: How does Rashi know this is why Reuvein wanted to save him? Perhaps he was very pious and did not want to kill? The answer is: In Parshas@IT @itVayechi, among the blessings with which Yaakov blessed his sons, it is written that he blessed Yehudah, who said: “What will we gain if we kill our brother.<TIE>.<TIE>. come let us sell him.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Yet, why did Yaakov not bless Reuvein, who wanted to totally rescue Yoseif and bring him back to his father? Whereas Yehudah suggested to sell him! Perforce, Reuven’s intent was not for the sake of Heaven, but so people should not put the blame on him, saying: “You are the firstborn.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1[23]@p2<TIE>This is an additional one that his father gave him in excess of what was given to the brothers.@p3 @ITRe’m@it explains that it is all one garment. He was wearing only one @hh<HEB>כתונת@ee<ENG>, which was of @hh<HEB>פסים@ee<ENG>, and the verse reads as follows: “They stripped him of his @hh<HEB>כתונת@ee<ENG>.” Which @hh<HEB>כתונת@ee<ENG>? “The @hh<HEB>פסים כתונת@ee<ENG> that he had on.” It cannot mean that he wore two @hh<HEB>כתונות@ee<ENG>, one top of the other, because only the garment touching the skin is called @hh<HEB>כתונת@ee<ENG>. But @ITMaharshal@it writes: It seems to me not so. Rather, he had on two @hh<HEB>כתונות@ee<ENG>, one on top of the other. The first was on his skin, so that sweat should not ruin the @hh<HEB>כתונת@ee<ENG> of @hh<HEB>פסים@ee<ENG>. They stripped off both garments at once by grasping the bottom one and removing both. That is why it says @hh<HEB>אשר עליו@ee<ENG> (“that was on @ITit@it”), referring to the other garment on which the @hh<HEB>פסים כתונת@ee<ENG> was on top of. The reason they grasped the bottom one was to show him that they were not doing this because his father gave him an additional @hh<HEB>כתונת@ee<ENG> of @hh<HEB>פסים@ee<ENG>. Rather, it was because of his bad reports and his dreams [that he told his father]. @p1[24]@p2<TIE>No water in it but there@BI were @BOsnakes and scorpions in it. @boRashi deduces [that it had snakes and scorpions] because it is written, “The pit was empty.” If sticks and stones or the like were in it, this would not be called empty. But with snakes and scorpions, the pit could well be called empty, as they crawl into the holes and cracks, so the pit looks like it is empty although they are there. [Alternatively], it is derived from a @ITgezeirah shavah. @itIn Devarim 8:15 it is written: “Snake, serpent, and scorpion.<TIE>.<TIE>. there was no water.” Just as there, “there was no water” describes a pit with snakes and scorpions, so too here, “there was no water” describes a pit with snakes and scorpions. But it seems to me that “there was no water” cannot teach us that sticks and stones were there, because what difference would that make? Perforce, it comes to tell us that other dangers were there, and they threw him in nevertheless. (@ITR. Meir Stern@it) We need not ask: If there were snakes and scorpions in the pit, how was Reuven going to rescue him? The snakes and scorpions would kill him! For the answer is: The brothers did not know about this. They thought the pit did not contain even snakes and scorpions. Otherwise, how could they want to sell him after seeing the miracle Hashem performed for him, that he was not harmed or killed? (@ITRe’m@it)<QC>
@p1[26]@p2<TIE>What profit? as Onkelos translates it.@p3 I.e., we should not explain @hh<HEB>בצע@ee<ENG> as “theft.” @p1@p2And we will conceal his death.@p3 Rashi is answering the questions: He was not a wild animal or a bird, [whose blood there is a mitzvah to cover. Why does it say, “Cover up his blood”?] Furthermore, they threw him into a pit. What blood was there to be covered? @p1[28]@p2<TIE>Yaakov’s sons [pulled] Yoseif from the pit and sold him to the Yishmaelites.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi deduces this from what is written, “They pulled Yoseif up from the pit and sold Yoseif.” If it was the Midianites [who did all this], how could they sell him? He did not yet belong to them! And if [you suggest that] the Midianites pulled him out of the pit without the brothers’ knowledge and sold him, why is it written later (45:4), “I am Yoseif your brother, whom you sold into Egypt”? They never sold him! And why would the brothers say, “Come let us sell him to the Yishmaelites,” if they never sold him? Perforce, “they pulled” refers to Yaakov’s sons who sold him to the Yishmaelites, and the Yishmaelites sold him to the Midianites. We need not ask: How does Rashi know that the Yishmaelites sold him to the Midianites? Perhaps they sold him to the @hh<HEB>מדנים@ee<ENG> [written without the intermediate @ITyud@it, see v. 36], which is a different nation — as it is written (25:2), “Medan, Midian.<TIE>.<TIE>.” [The answer is:] If so, why does the verse mention, “Midianite merchants passed by”? They must be mentioned in connection with Yoseif’s sale, that the Yishmaelites sold him to the Midianites, and the Midianites to the @hh<HEB>מדנים@ee<ENG>, and the @hh<HEB>מדנים@ee<ENG> to Potiphar. So it seems to me. @ITRe’m@it <HS><HS>asks: The verse says, “Potiphar bought him from the Yishmaelites” (39:1). [But did not the Yishmaelites already sell him to the Midianites?] It appears that the answer is: Although he was sold several times, the Midianites had not yet paid. Because of this, he still belonged to the Yishmaelites, as the Midianites received [from their sale of Yoseif] only the profit, i.e., the amount that exceeded what they owed the Yishmaelites. @p1[29]@p2<TIE>He was not present when he was sold, for his day had arrived to go and attend to his father. [@p3You might ask:] What forced Rashi to say this? Perhaps he went to take care of business. And the same [question can be asked] according to the alternate explanation, that “he was occupied with his sack-cloth and fasting.” The answer is: If he had gone for mundane business, how was he allowed to leave? He knew his brothers wanted to kill Yoseif. Why did he not fear they would kill Yoseif when he left? Perforce, he went for a mitzvah, as his day had arrived, etc. There is a question [on the first explanation]: Why does it say he “returned” (@hh<HEB>וישב@ee<ENG>)? It should say he “came.” Therefore Rashi brings the alternate explanation, [according to which @hh<HEB>וישב@ee<ENG> is] an expression of repentance (@hh<HEB>תשובה@ee<ENG>). And the second explanation is insufficient on its own, as he should have waited for another day [to do repentance], because of [the danger to] Yoseif. Thus Rashi explains that “his day had arrived.<TIE>.<TIE>.” and he could not delay. (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1@p2Another explanation: He was occupied with his sack-cloth.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi deduces this because it is written here, “Reuvein @ITreturned@it to the pit,” and it says, “Mordechai @ITreturned@it to the king’s gate wearing sack-cloth” (Esther 6:12). Just as “returned” over there refers to sack-cloth and fasting, so too here. Reuvein must have done his repentance secretly, and thus he was absent at the time of Yoseif’s sale. Otherwise it would contradict Rashi’s explanation of @hh<HEB>וזאת ליהודה@ee<ENG> (Devarim 33:7), that Yehudah’s confession over the incident with Tamar was what influenced Reuvein to @ITconfess@it and repent over the incident with Bilhah. Therefore it must be that Reuvein first repented secretly and later he did so publicly.<QC>
@p1[30]@p2<TIE>Where can I flee from my father’s grief?@p3 [Rashi knows it means this] because otherwise, would the boy not being there cause a lack of space for Reuvein, leaving him nowhere to flee? Perforce, it means: since the boy is not there, I must flee from my father’s grief, and where can I flee? @p1[33]@p2<TIE>Is this.@p3 It is an abbreviated verse. For without [adding] “is this,” it is not understandable. @p1@p2It is his destiny that Potiphar’s wife would provoke him.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because otherwise Scripture should have written, “Yoseif has been torn to pieces,” [omitting “evil beast had devoured him”]. Furthermore, Rashi is answering the question: How would Yaakov know that a wild animal tore him up? Perhaps bandits attacked him. @p1@p2Because they banned and cursed anyone who would reveal it and they included God with them.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Hashem surely was not “forced” [as it were]. But He willingly agreed with the ban for a number of reasons. First, so that [the decree of] “Your descendants will be foreigners in a land not theirs.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (15:13) could be fulfilled. If Yaakov had known that Yoseif was brought to Egypt, he would have given all the money in the world to redeem him! Second, if Yaakov had known [what the brothers did] he would have cursed them that their names be blotted out, and the seed of Yisrael would have perished — whereas Hashem wanted them to be fruitful and multiply. As Rashi proceeds to explain, “Hashem does not @ITwish@it to reveal it to him,” implying that He was not forced. Had He wished, He could have revealed it, but He agreed with them in order to fulfill the decree, “.<TIE>.<TIE>.They will enslave them and oppress them” (ibid). Third, it says: “He mourned his son for many days” (v. 24), and Rashi explains that it was twenty-two years. Why did Rashi say specifically twenty-two? He must have been answering the question: Why did Hashem put Yaakov in anguish for twenty-two years, and not tell him [that Yoseif was alive]? Perforce, it was for the twenty-two years that Yaakov did not honor his parents. Whereas if Hashem would tell Yaakov, he would repent, nullifying the twentytwo year decree of anguish. But because Hashem wished to punish him for not having honored his parents, He agreed to the brothers’ ban on revealing it. A ban (@hh<HEB>חרם@ee<ENG>) is like an oath, and when Hashem takes an oath [over a decree of punishment], repentance cannot nullify it. For it says [about Moshe’s punishment]: “Therefore, you will not bring this congregation into the land that I have given them” (Bamidbar 20:12). And Rashi there explains: “This was said as an oath.<TIE>.<TIE>. He swore precipitously, so that he should not pray at length about it [to nullify the decree].” Here as well, the ban was like an oath; thus Hashem agreed with them. @p1[34]@p2<TIE>Twenty-two years.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 @ITMaharik@it writes (ch. 37) that Rashi cited this, although it is not the verse’s simple meaning, in order to explain why Hashem agreed to the ban and did not reveal to Yaakov [that Yoseif was alive]. It was because He had decreed that Yaakov be anguished for twenty-two years. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1@p2Yaakov did not fulfill honoring one’s father and mother.@p3 You might ask: Why was he punished for this? Yitzchak and Rivkah commanded him to go there and take a wife! Rabbeinu Bechaye answers in Parshas Toldos (28:1): They intended for him to marry Leah and return immediately. But he desired Rochel because of her beauty and said, “I will work for you seven years for Rochel” (29:18). Thus, all the time he spent there was his own choice. (@ITKitzur Mizrachi@it) @p1[35]@p2<TIE>A twin sister was born with each brother.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 It means that each brother married his brother’s twin, i.e., his paternal but not maternal sister — since a paternal sister is not considered incest for the sons of Noach.<QC>
@p1@p2A person cannot accept consolation for one who is alive but is thought to be dead.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 The question is asked: Did Yaakov not know that consolation cannot be accepted for a live person thought to be dead? If so, why did he mourn over Yoseif? He would know he was alive! The answer is: Yaakov in fact did not know this because “consolation cannot be accepted for one who is alive but thought to be dead,” is learned from the case of Yaakov himself. Heaven decreed that the dead be forgotten, allowing consolation to be accepted. Yet, Yaakov did not accept consolation. Therefore, we derive that consolation cannot be accepted in such a case, and Yaakov was therefore unaware of this. @ITMaharshal@it answers: When a person agitates himself, he is unaware that his anguish is excessive because he considers all the anguish as nothing. @p1@p2The same as @HB<HEB>על בני@BO<ENG>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 It means, “because of my son.” This is because [in this verse,] @hh<HEB>אל@ee<ENG> cannot mean “next to” or “to,” as in, “Avimelech came to him (@hb<HEB>אל@hhיו@ee<ENG>) from Gerar” (26:26), and as in, “He said to him (@hb<HEB>אל@hhיו@ee<ENG>): ‘I am Adonoy’” (15:7). @p1@p2While still in mourning will I be buried and not be consoled all of my life.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., this mourning will stay with me until I am buried. But not that I will mourn in the grave, for there is neither mourning nor joy there.<QC>
@p1@p2If none of my children die in my lifetime then I am assured not to see Gehinom.@p3 @ITShe’ol@it is one of Gehinom’s seven names. The rationale [of the sign] is that a person can be judged to twelve months [at most] in Gehinom. If Yaakov’s twelve sons are all alive, corresponding to the twelve months, Gehinom cannot affect him. (@ITGur Aryeh@it) @p1@p2But he did not mourn, for he knew that he was alive.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Scripture should have written simply, “@ITHe@it wept for him,” as it had written before: “All @IThis @itsons and daughters rose to console him.” [Why does it say, “His@IT father @itwept for him”?] A further question: Why does it say, “He wept,” rather than, “He mourned,” as it said before: “He mourned for his son”? Thus Rashi explains that it refers to Yitzchok, about whom it cannot be said, “He mourned,” for he knew Yoseif was alive. And we need not ask how Yitzchok knew, as Hashem might have revealed it to him to save him anguish; for the ban was only against revealing it to Yaakov. @p1[36]@p2<TIE>The slaughterers of the king’s animals.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because if Hashem brought balsam and lotus carriers for Yoseif, to spare him the odor of naphta [see Rashi on v. 25], He surely would not bring him to an executioner, who is even more repulsive. Onkelos holds that Potiphar was merely appointed over the executioners, but he himself did not kill. (@ITGur Aryeh@it)<QC>
@p1[2]@p2<TIE>A merchant.@p3 You might ask: How does Rashi know that this term refers to a merchant? Perhaps Shua was an actual Canaanite. The answer is: Avraham did not want to give Yitzchok a Canaanite wife, and also Yitzchok commanded Yaakov not to marry one, so Yaakov’s sons surely would not [marry a Canaanite] either. But you might object: Rashi explained on 37:35, “R. Nechemiah says: ‘They [Yaakov’s daughters-in-law] were Canaanites,’” implying the sons did marry Canaanites. The answer is: Men from a different nation took Canaanite women and begat daughters, [whom Yaakov’s sons married], for these daughters were not [true] Canaanites because the lineage follows the father. But here it cannot be explained so, since it is written, “The daughter of a Canaanite @ITman@it,” implying that the @ITfather@it was Canaanite.<QC>
@p1[7]@p2<TIE>Why did Er waste his seed?@p3 However, it is understood why Onan wasted his [seed], as the verse explains: the son is called by the name of his deceased brother, and Onan did not want to do this.<QC>
@p1[8]@p2<TIE>The son will be called by the name of the one who is dead.@p3 @ITNachalas Yaakov@it extensively contradicts @ITRamban@it and @ITRe’m@it, [who explain that the son would literally be named after the deceased]; see there. @ITNachalas Yaakov@it rather explains that calling the son after the deceased means that it is considered as if the deceased were his father. That is why the verse says, “Establish @ITseed@it for your brother,” and not, “Establish a @ITname@it for your brother,” for the name is not the issue. See there. @p1[11]@p2<TIE>Meaning, he pushed her off with a straw.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Is the verse not self-contradictory? First it is written @hh<HEB>עד יגדל שלה בני@ee<ENG>, implying Yehudah intended to give her to Sheilah. Then it is written @hh<HEB>כי אמר פן ימות@ee<ENG>, implying Yehudah did not want to do so. Furthermore, when it says @hh<HEB>כי@ee<ENG>, how is this a reason for the preceding? If she is a woman whose husbands die, how could Yehudah give her to Sheilah when he comes of age? Therefore Rashi explains that Yehudah offered a pretense when he said @hh<HEB>עד יגדל שלה בני@ee<ENG>, for he did not intend that Sheilah should marry her. And when it says @hb<HEB>כי@hh אמר פן ימות@ee<ENG>, this is giving the reason for [the verse’s implied statement] why he did not intend for them to marry. @p1[13]@p2<TIE>“Shimshon went down, etc.<TIE>.<TIE>. to Timnah”.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Question:] In the previous verse it is written, “He went up,” and Rashi explained that this is connected with “to Timnah.” If so, why did Rashi not make his comment there? The answer is: [Based on the previous verse alone, Rashi would agree that] “He went up” could be connected with “to his sheep-shearers.” I.e., he went up the mountain to where the shepherds were, to stand by his sheep-shearers. [Thus, Rashi’s comment depends on the present verse.]<QC>
@p1[14]@p2<TIE>She covered her face so that he not recognize her.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because it is written later, “Because she had covered her face” — implying that this was already mentioned before. @p1@p2At the opening of the eyes, at the crossroads.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [It is so called] because two roads branch out, each in a different direction than the other, to here and to there, and one needs to open his eyes and think which road to take. @hh<HEB>פתח עינים@ee<ENG> means opening one’s eyes. @p1@p2Our Sages explain it Midrashically: At the entrance of our father Avraham.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., at the tomb of our father Avraham. She prayed that a descendant of Avraham should come to her in order to have children by him. So say @ITChazal@it in Sotah 10a. @p1@p2She desired to have children.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because afterwards she went back to her widow’s garb. If she did it to be promiscuous, she would not have gone back to her widow’s garb. (@ITMaharshal@it)<QC>
@p1[15]@p2<TIE>Because she was sitting at the crossroads.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: How is, “Because she had covered her face,” a reason for [Yehudah to think] that she was a harlot? On the contrary, it shows she is modest! Thus Rashi explains, “Because she was sitting at the crossroads.” Then Rashi says that he did not recognize her “because she had covered her face.” Had he recognized her he would not have “thought she was a harlot.” You might ask: How could Yehudah go to a harlot? The Patriarchs and their children kept the Torah, so how could he transgress, “There shall not be a harlot” (Devarim 23:18)? @ITRe’m@it answers: Perhaps he performed @ITkiddushin@it with her through money or a written contract, and the goat-kid [which he promised to send] was only to appease her [i.e., not a harlot’s fee]. An alternate answer: He had relations with her as an act of @ITkiddushin. @itAlthough it says in Kiddushin 12b that it is impudent to perform @ITkiddushin @itby having relations, this is only when there are witnesses. Privately it is permitted, and here there were no witnesses — only his [close] friend who was considered as himself. Or, it was not in his friend’s presence. Accordingly, the verse says @hh<HEB>הבה נא@ee<ENG> (v.16), which Rashi explains as, “Prepare yourself and your mind for this,” it means to prepare for @ITkiddushin @itby having relations. An alternate answer: Yehudah held that, “There shall not be a harlot,” applies only between a Jew and a Jewess, but a non-Jewess is merely forbidden Rabbinically. @p1@p2At her father-in-law’s house, she was a modest woman, therefore, he did not suspect her.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because otherwise he would have recognized her when they spoke and also during their having relations, since afterwards she must have uncovered her face. This is why Rashi brings the Midrash. (@ITDevek Tov@it) @p1[18]@p2<TIE>@HB<HEB>עזקתך ושושיפך@BO<ENG>, the ring that you use as a seal.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Why does Onkelos translate @hh<HEB>חותמך@ee<ENG> as @hh<HEB>עזקתך@ee<ENG>, which means “your ring”? In the verse it is written @hh<HEB>חותם@ee<ENG>, which means “seal.” Therefore Rashi explains that it means, “The ring that you use as a seal.” Also, why does Onkelos translate @hh<HEB>פתילך@ee<ENG> as @hh<HEB>שושיפך@ee<ENG>, which means “your cloak”? In the verse it is written @hh<HEB>פתילך@ee<ENG>, “your thread.” Therefore Rashi explains that it means, “The cloak with which you cover yourself.” This is because @hh<HEB>פתיל@ee<ENG> is written regarding tzitzis (Bamidbar15:38), and about tzitzis it is written, “Your garment with which you cover yourself” (Devarim 22:12). So too here, [@hh<HEB>פתילך@ee<ENG> means,] “The cloak with which you cover yourself.” @p1@p2Strong men, as he was; and righteous men, as he was.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Why is it written @hh<HEB>ותהר @hbלו@ee<ENG>? Scripture should have written @hh<HEB>ותהר @hbממנו@ee<ENG>. Just as it says @hh<HEB>צדקה @hbממני@ee<ENG> (v. 26), which Rashi explains as, “‘It is from me’ that she has become pregnant.” Perforce, @hh<HEB>לו@ee<ENG> means having similar traits. And we need not ask how Rashi knew they were strong @ITand@it righteous, because the answer is that [both traits are equally implied. So] which one would you exclude?<QC>
@p1[23]@p2<TIE>Let her keep what she has.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: He already gave her it. Why does it say, “Let her take it?” Thus Rashi explains, “Let her keep.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1@p2The thing will become public and will result in disgrace.@p3 Rashi is saying that the disgrace is not due to leaving the security with her. @p1@p2For what else is there for me to do to be true to my word?@p3 Rashi is answering the question: How is, “Behold I sent her.<TIE>.<TIE>.” a reason for what preceded? Thus Rashi explains that Yehudah meant: If you say I must [search for her] since I promised her a goat-kid, [this is not so]. For what else is there for me to do? “Behold, I sent her this kid.<TIE>.<TIE>.” I.e., Rashi inserted the phrase, “For what else is there for me to do,” before, “Behold I sent her,” to explain the connection between, “Let her take it,” and, “Behold I sent her.” @p1[24]@p2<TIE>Most of the first and most of the last.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Although the fetus is discernable only after three months, a third of the pregnancy, that is for [a full term, i.e.,] nine month pregnancy. But Tamar had a seven-month term. For it is written about her, “When the time came for her to give birth” (v. 27). It is not written, “When her days of pregnancy were @ITcompleted@it,” as it does about Rivkah. So explains Rashi on 25:24. Because of this, the fetus was discernable before three months. @p1@p2And the entire middle month.@p3 You might ask: How does Rashi know this? Perhaps the opposite is true: it was the entire first and second month, and part of the third. Or, it was part of the first month, and the entire second and third month. The answer is: If so, it would be two months and just ten days [when the child would be discernable]. One of the months would be only ten days, i.e., a third of a month. This is a minority of a month, and cannot be considered a month, whereas the verse says: “About three months later,” implying three whole months. @ITRe’m@it answers: Perhaps a fetus is discernable after a third of the pregnancy only if it includes the majority of the first month, the whole second month, and the majority of the third month. Since the majority is considered like all, it is counted like three whole months — and the months themselves have an effect [on the fetus’ development]. @p1@p2An adjective — pregnant.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi means as follows: Although @hh<HEB>הרה@ee<ENG> is sometimes a future tense verb, such as in, “Behold you will conceive (@hh<HEB>הרה@ee<ENG>) and give birth to a son” (16:11), here it cannot mean this. For how would they know that Tamar will conceive? Thus Rashi explains it as an adjective. @p1@p2She was the daughter of Sheim who was a Kohein.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Not literally a daughter, for Sheim had died when Yaakov was fifty, and now Yaakov was over one hundred and ten. Rather, she was from Sheim’s family.<QC>
@p1@p2They, therefore, sentenced her to be burned.@p3 You might ask: Why was she liable for burning? She was neither married nor betrothed, and only then is a Kohein’s daughter burned. Although she needed @ITyibum, @itthis does not make her liable for death because [promiscuity in such a case] is merely a Biblical prohibition: “The wife of the deceased shall not marry out” (Devarim 25:5). The answer is: They sentenced her to death so as to cast fear on the people and save the generation from becoming immoral. And once she had been sentenced to death, it was by burning because we find elsewhere that the execution of a Kohein’s daughter was by burning. Also Rashi holds this view, as he explains, “They, therefore, sentenced her to be burned.” This is as @ITRe’m@it explained. But @ITMaharshal@it asks: Was she not unmarried [and not liable for death]? He answers: She [was liable because she] needed @ITyibum.@it @p1[25]@p2<TIE>From here they concluded: Better for a person to be thrown into a fiery furnace.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 You might ask: How did @ITChazal@it know this? Perhaps Tamar did not inform [that it was Yehudah] because she was not yet thrown into the fire, neither was it burning. But had the fire been burning she would have informed. The answer is as Rabbeinu Tam explains in Tosafos, Bava Metzia 59a: It is written here @hh<HEB>היא מוצת@ee<ENG>, missing an @hh<HEB>א@ee<ENG>, which is similar to, “He has kindled (@hh<HEB>ויצת@ee<ENG>) a fire in Zion” (Eichah 4:11). This implies that the fire was burning and still she did not inform. This is why @ITChazal@it concluded as they did. @p1@p2Please recognize your Creator and do not destroy.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 She did not know there were three lives. Rashi says this because in truth it was so, but she mentioned only two lives. @ITMaharshal, @ithowever, explains that Rashi knew this because it is written @hh<HEB>הכר נא@ee<ENG>. Why is @hh<HEB>נא@ee<ENG> written in the middle [of her plea]? It should be at the beginning or the end. From this Rashi deduces that she first said: “@hh<HEB>הכר@ee<ENG> (recognize) that I conceived from you,” [i.e., there are two lives]. Then she added @hh<HEB>נא@ee<ENG>, as if to say, “I have another request: Do not destroy the additional life.” I.e., do not destroy three lives. @p1[26]@p2<TIE>In what she has said.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: @hh<HEB>צדקה ממני@ee<ENG> implies she was more righteous than him. But here, what does it matter whether she was more righteous? @p1@p2She is righteous in what she has said.@p3 But she is not righteous in her act of illicit relations. The verse says, “He did not know that she was his daughter-in-law” (v. 16), implying that if he had known he would not have been with her. But she knew, so how did she permit herself to do this? She should not have relied on stretched explanations [that it was permitted due to @ITyibum@it]. But she is righteous in what she said, for I do indeed recognize the signs as belonging to me. She assumedly conceived from me, since they said, “There was no harlot here.” Also the calculation of “about three months” is proof. Although she could have conceived from others, who might also have been with her, that is a mere possibility whereas the signs are definite. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1@p2Conformed with the law inasmuch as I did not give her to my son Sheilah.@p3 [Rashi knows it means this] because it says both @hh<HEB>כי@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>על כן@ee<ENG>, when one is sufficient. @p1@p2Some say he did not continue whereas others say he did not cease.@p3 Some say Yehudah did not continue since his only reason for being with her would be to establish seed in the name of the deceased. As he had done this, he ceased from relations [although Halachically she was his wife]. And some say he did not cease since he saw she yearned to have children from him. Her intentions were pure, so he continued being with her. @p1[28]@p2<TIE>One extended his hand outside and after she tied.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi explains that it means “extended” because @hh<HEB>ויתן יד@ee<ENG> [would seem to] imply that the fetus intended to give her a hand. And Rashi says “one,” meaning that it was one of the two, because the verse does not state who put out his hand, nor does Scripture state @hh<HEB>המוציא@ee<ENG> or @hh<HEB>הנותן@ee<ENG> [as is usual when the subject is unidentified]. And Rashi adds, “After she tied the thread on it he withdrew it,” because @hh<HEB>כמשיב ידו@ee<ENG> [implies he put his hand back out, which] is understandable only if he had withdrawn it. @p1[30]@p2<TIE>Corresponding the four bans .<TIE>.<TIE>. corresponding to the four things that he took<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., the four things Achan took, which were: a cloak from Shinar, two chunks of silver worth 200 shekels, making three, and a strand of gold, making four. @ITRe’m@it objects: Sanhedrin 43b mentions a view that he violated three bans, and a view that it was five — four in Moshe’s time and one in Yehoshua’s. Either way, it was not four. @ITRe’m@it answers: According to Bereishis Rabbah, [which Rashi is citing, this verse] deals only with the four bans of Moshe’s days. But this is incorrect because Bereishis Rabbah lists the four bans: those of Amalek, Sichon and Og, Yericho, and Midian. This is three in Moshe’s days and one in Yehoshua’s. There is a lengthy answer to this. But the Maharsha emends the text in Sanhedrin 43b to read: “Rabbi Yochanan said it was @ITfour@it bans.<TIE>.<TIE>.” [Accordingly, Rashi was following this view.] (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1@p2Because of the bright color of the scarlet thread.@p3 [Rashi knew this because this way Zorach] is like Peretz, who was named after what happened. @p1[1]@p2<TIE>[Scripture now] returns to the earlier narrative, but only interrupted it.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because otherwise [there is a question:] Is it not already written, “The Midianites sold him [in Egypt to Potiphar]” (37:36)? Perforce, Scripture “only interrupted it to relate.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (@ITGur Aryeh@it) @p1@p2Also, in order to relate the narrative of Potiphar’s wife to the narrative of Tamar.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 You might ask: Why did Rashi not explain this before, at the beginning of the section (38:1)? There, Rashi asks why Scripture interrupted to tell the narrative of Yehudah, and Rashi explains only that “his brothers demoted him,” but he did not bring this alternate explanation. The answer is: Before, one could have objected: how does Rashi know that Tamar had pure motives? But now that Rashi proves that her motive were pure, from the verse, “She is righteous, it is from me,” he therefore brings the explanation here. (@ITKitzur Mizrachi@it) Question: According to the first explanation, Scripture should have only interrupted [by telling the narrative of Yehudah] until, “Many days passed .<TIE>.<TIE>. the wife of Yehudah died.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (38:12), where a different episode begins. Why did it not [return and] finish the narrative of Yoseif at that point? Rashi answers, “In order to connect the narrative of Potiphar’s wife to the narrative of Tamar.” But with this explanation only, [a question arises:] The narrative of Yehudah should begin with, “Many days passed .<TIE>.<TIE>. the wife of Yehudah died.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Why begin with, “Yehudah descended from his brothers” (38:1)? [The answer is:] Perforce, to indicate that they demoted Yehudah. Accordingly, at the beginning of the section Rashi is explaining only why “Yehudah descended from his brothers” follows after Yoseif’s sale. Thus he wrote only the first explanation. But here Rashi is explaining the reason for the @ITentire@it interruption, so he brings both explanations. (@ITGur Aryeh@it)<QC>
@p1[6]@p2<TIE>A reference to his wife.@p3 You might ask: Perhaps it was actual bread? The answer is: Rashi deduced this from what Yoseif said (v. 9), “He has not withheld anything from me other than you,” implying that Potiphar placed everything except his wife in Yoseif’s hand. Thus, “bread” must refer to his wife. @p1@p2Once he perceived himself as a ruler.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because otherwise, why is it mentioned here? [Alternatively,] Rashi is answering the question: @hh<HEB>ויהי@ee<ENG> always refers to a new occurrence. But was not Yoseif well-built from birth, and assumedly good looking too? Rashi answers: “Once he perceived himself a ruler.<TIE>.<TIE>.” and this he did not do before. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1@p2I will provoke the bear against you. Immediately:@p3 Rashi calls her a beast because it is written (37:33), “An evil beast has devoured him,” referring to Potiphar’s wife, as Rashi explained there. And he calls her a bear because a bear has no rest; it is always moving. So too was Potiphar’s wife — she had no rest because of her pursuit of Yoseif to have relations with him. @p1[10]@p2<TIE>Even without intimacy.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because otherwise, why is it not written @hh<HEB>לשכב עמה@ee<ENG>, as it said before (v. 7), @hh<HEB>שכבה עמי@ee<ENG>? You might ask: If he would not lie next to her even without intimacy, why does it then say, “nor to be with her,” which Rashi explains as referring to the World to Come? For what would he be punished? [The answer is:] Perhaps the verse is saying he would not lie next to her even without intimacy because he feared his evil inclination might bring him to intimacy, and he would go to Gehinnom. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1[11]@p2<TIE>Rav and Shmuel: One says, literally, his work.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 @ITTosafos@it explain in Sotah 36b [that the second explanation is] because it says @hh<HEB>ויבא הביתה@ee<ENG>, which is the same word as @hh<HEB>ביאה@ee<ENG> (relations). The verse could have [omitted this phrase and] said: “It was on such a day, and no man of the household was there.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1@p2But, his father’s image appeared to him.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because it is written, “No man @ITof the household@it was there in the house,” implying another man was there. (@ITTosafos ibid@it, citing @ITR. Moshe Hadarshan@it) Perforce it was Yaakov, as Rashi comments on 49:24. @p1[14]@p2<TIE>From the other side of the river. One who is a descendant of Eiver.@p3  [Question:] On the verse, “He told Avram the Hebrew” (14:13), Rashi explained: “He came from the other side of the river.” Why did he not he also explain, “A descendant of Eiver”? The answer is: “The other side of the river” is a sufficient explanation for Avraham, who came from there himself. But for Avraham’s descendants it is not sufficient, as they did not come from there, so Rashi needed both explanations. And it is not sufficient to say only that they are descendants of Eiver, because why should they be called after Eiver, and not after Shem? (@ITGur Aryeh@it)<QC>
@p1[17]@p2<TIE>In order to mock me, the Hebrew slave that you brought to us.@p3 Rashi changes the order of the verse, because as written it implies that her husband brought the Hebrew slave in order to mock her, which is incorrect.<QC>
@p1[22]@p2<TIE>As Onkelos translates it: It was done at his command.@p3 It means he had slaves under him, whom he told what to do — i.e., “It was done at his command.” It does not mean that he did what had to be done, for then he would be their servant. And that is not, “Granting him favor in the eyes of the prison chief.”<QC>
@p1[23]@p2<TIE>Because God was with him.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because the @hh<HEB>ב@ee<ENG> of @hb<HEB>ב@hhאשר ה' אתו@ee<ENG> cannot follow its usual meaning, [“@ITwhen@it Hashem was with him”]. For it says afterwards, “@ITWhatever@it he did, Hashem made him succeed” — not sometimes yes and sometimes no. @p1[1]@p2<TIE>One, a fly was found in his cup.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 @hh<HEB>פיילי@ee<ENG> means cup in Aramaic. Then Rashi explains that in Greek, cup is @hh<HEB>פוטירין@ee<ENG>. @p1@p2A pebble was found in the bread of the other.@p3 You might ask: Perhaps it was the opposite? The answer is: It must have happened this way, because the other way a question arises — why was this one hanged, and the other, not? It is understandable if the fly was the butler’s. He was not hanged because it was beyond his control; he could not prevent a fly from suddenly falling into the cup. The baker, however, whose bread had a pebble, was negligent. He should have cleaned out the oven thoroughly, so that no pebble remained.<QC>
@p1[4]@p2<TIE>To be with them.@p3 I.e., the verse seems to imply that the chief of the slaughterers appointed Yoseif along with them, and they too had been appointed over something. Had Scripture previously written that the butler and baker received appointments, this would be understandable. But now that Scripture did not [write this], what is the meaning of, “With them?” Therefore Rashi explains that it means, “To be with them.” @p1@p2@HB<HEB>ימים@BO<ENG> refers to twelve months.@p3 Rashi deduces this from (Vayikra 25:29), @hh<HEB>ימים תהיה גאולתו@ee<ENG>, through a @ITgezeirah shavah@it between @hh<HEB>ימים@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>ימים@ee<ENG>. We need not ask: Perhaps they were there for two days [because @hh<HEB>ימים@ee<ENG> literally means “days” and implies a minimum of two], and they dreamt on the second night? For [the answer is:] If so, why would Yoseif say (v. 13): “In @ITanother@it three days,” [if three days had not yet past]? He should have simply said, “After three days.” @p1[5]@p2<TIE>The same as @HB<HEB>ויחלמו שניהם חלום@BO<ENG>.@p3 Meaning: each of the two had a dream. Not that each saw the dream of both of them, i.e., his dream and that of his fellow.<QC>
@p1@p2The Midrashic explanation, however, is: Each of them dreamed his own dream @BIand @BOthe interpretation of the other’s.<TIE>.<TIE>. @bo@ITChazal@it interpreted the verse literally. But instead of saying that each dreamed the other’s dream, they said, “The @ITinterpretation@it of the other’s dream.” We need not ask: How do @ITChazal@it know this? Perhaps it means literally, that each one dreamed his own dream and the other’s dream. For the answer is: Right afterwards it is written @hh<HEB>איש חלומו בלילה אחד@ee<ENG>, [implying each had only his own dream,] whereas at first it said @hh<HEB>חלום שניהם@ee<ENG>, implying that each had two dreams. Since this is self-contradictory, it must mean his dream and the interpretation of the other’s. And when it is written@hh<HEB>איש כפתרון חלומו@ee<ENG>, i.e., like the interpretation of his friend’s [dream, perforce] it means a dream consistent with the matter destined to befall them. It cannot mean as it sounds, that he saw also the interpretation [of his own dream]. For if so, what was there for Yoseif to interpret?<QC>
@p1[10]@p2<TIE>It seemed as if it budded.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is explaining that the @hh<HEB>כ@ee<ENG> of @hb<HEB>כ@hhפורחת@ee<ENG> denotes “similar to.” It does not denote “when” (@hb<HEB>כ@hhאשר@ee<ENG>), for such a @hh<HEB>כ@ee<ENG> occurs only with a gerund (a type of noun), but not with a verb. But @hh<HEB>ויהי @hbכמשיב@hh ידו@ee<ENG> (38:29) [raises a question. Is it not a verb, and yet it has such a @hh<HEB>כ@ee<ENG>? The answer is: It] means, “it appeared as if he put back his hand.” He did it unintentionally. However since he put out his hand, the midwife tied on the scarlet thread, and then he immediately pulled it back, it seemed as if he had done so intentionally. Therefore Scripture describes it as such.<QC>
@p1@p2@p3Onkelos, who translates @hb<HEB>כ@hhפורחת@ee<ENG> as @hh<HEB>כד אפרחת@ee<ENG>, “when it budded,” is rendering a non-literal meaning. The proof is that he renders the present-tense verb @hh<HEB>פורחת@ee<ENG> as @hh<HEB>אפרחת@ee<ENG>, which is in the past tense. (@ITRe’m@it) @p1@p2In my dream it seemed as if it budded.@p3 In other words, in my dream I saw it actually budding like a budding vine. [It looked like the real thing,] not like something that had been altered and is “similar to.” @p1@p2And @BIafter@BO it budded, the blossoms bloomed.<TIE>.<TIE>. @boI.e., he did not see it all happen simultaneously, as the verse seems to imply. [Rashi knows this] because Heaven does not show a person an elephant standing in a needle’s eye. [I.e., prophetic dreams are not absurd.] @p1[12]@p2<TIE>They are a @BIsymbol@BO to you of three days. @boI.e., they are not three days themselves, as the verse seems to imply.<QC>
@p1[14]@p2<TIE>[@HB<HEB>כי@BO<ENG> means:] that if you will remember me after.<TIE>.<TIE>. @boIn other words, Pharaoh will lift your head and you will be so important “that” if you mention me, you will be able to get me out. @hh<HEB>כי@ee<ENG> denotes “that” (@hh<HEB>אשר@ee<ENG>). This is because @hh<HEB>כי@ee<ENG> has four meanings, and one is @hh<HEB>אם@ee<ENG>, which is the same as @hh<HEB>אשר@ee<ENG>. Rashi adds, “@ITAfter@it things become well for you,” because it is not befitting to mention Yoseif right when Pharaoh treats the butler well, but later, while the butler is standing and serving [before Pharaoh].<QC>
@p1[20]@p2<TIE><NHS><NHS>@BIGinusia Day.@p3 <NHS><NHS>This means “birthday” in Greek. @p1[23]@p2<TIE>Afterwards. Because Yoseif depended on him.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because otherwise, why is it written here that the butler failed to remember? If to tell us that he did not deal kindly with Yoseif, this is already written: “It was at the end of two full years.<TIE>.<TIE>. the chief butler spoke to Pharaoh.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (41: 1-9). Perforce, it tells us that Hashem caused the butler not to remember Yoseif for two years because Yoseif depended on him. (@ITKitzur Mizrachi@it) In Shemos Rabboh ch. 7 it is explained that Yoseif deserved only ten years in prison, corresponding to his bad reports about his ten brothers. But since he said to the butler, “But @ITremember@it me.<TIE>.<TIE>. and @ITmention@it me,” two more years were added, because Yoseif mentioned @hh<HEB>זכירה@ee<ENG> twice. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it)<QC>
@p1[1]@p2<TIE>Every form of the word @HB<HEB>קץ@BO<ENG> means “the end.”@p3 It is obvious that @hh<HEB>קץ@ee<ENG> means “end,” as Onkelos translates it. However, [Rashi is answering the] question: Why does Scripture write the word @hh<HEB>ימים@ee<ENG>? It would be understandable if @hh<HEB>קץ@ee<ENG> did not [always] mean “end,” but [also can mean] “some of,” as in @hh<HEB>מ@hbקצ@hhה אחיו@ee<ENG>, “From some of his brothers” (47:2). Accordingly, here it mentions @hh<HEB>ימים@ee<ENG> to indicate that it was two full years, not part of two years. But if @hh<HEB>מקץ@ee<ENG> always means “end,” why does Scripture write @hh<HEB>ימים@ee<ENG>? Rashi answers: We might think @hh<HEB>מקץ@ee<ENG> means “some of,” and it @ITalways @itmeans this, unless it is evident otherwise from the verse. That is why it is written here @hh<HEB>ימים@ee<ENG> — to show that it means “end,” and not “some of.” Consequently, @hh<HEB>קץ@ee<ENG> @ITalways@it means “end.” For it is evident here that @hh<HEB>קץ@ee<ENG> means “end,” and we make a @ITgezeirah shavah@it between @hh<HEB>קץ@ee<ENG> [written here, and any other instance of] @hh<HEB>קץ@ee<ENG>. Thus Rashi says, “And [henceforth,] every form of the word @hh<HEB>קץ@ee<ENG> means ‘the end’.” So it seems to me, as opposed to @ITRe’m’s @itexplanation, that Rashi says every form of the word @hh<HEB>קץ@ee<ENG> means “the end” because Rashi wishes to distinguish @hh<HEB>קץ@ee<ENG> from @hh<HEB>קצה@ee<ENG>. This is because @hh<HEB>קצה@ee<ENG> sometimes means “end,” as in: “At the end (@hh<HEB>מקצה@ee<ENG>) of three years” (Devarim 14:28). And it sometimes means “side,” as in: “One cherub on this side (@hh<HEB>מקצה@ee<ENG>)” (Shemos 25:19). And it sometimes means “some of,” as in: “From some of (@hh<HEB>מקצה@ee<ENG>) his brothers” (47:2). Although [the word @hh<HEB>קץ@ee<ENG>] appeared several times previously in Scripture, [and Rashi did not comment there,] this is not problematic, as many similar cases exist [where Rashi does not explain a word the first time it appears]. @ITRe’m@it writes: We need not object that it says, “At the @hh<HEB>קץ@ee<ENG> of seven years, you are to make @ITshemitah@it” (Devarim 15:1), which apparently means at the beginning of @ITshemitah@it, as it is written, “But in the seventh year you must let it rest” (Shemos 23:11). For [the answer is:] The verse in Devarim is speaking of releasing debts (@hh<HEB>השמטת כספים@ee<ENG>), and this is at the end of @ITshemitah@it. @p1@p2All other rivers are not referred to as @HB<HEB>יאורים@BO<ENG> except for the Nile.<TIE>.<TIE>. @boRashi is answering the question: Why is it written @hb<HEB>ה@hhיאור@ee<ENG>, with a definite article? [The answer is:] Perforce it refers to the known @hh<HEB>יאור@ee<ENG>, mentioned earlier — the four @hh<HEB>נהרות@ee<ENG> written in Bereishis (2:11). Accordingly, why is it not written @hh<HEB>נהר@ee<ENG> here, like it does there? Surely [the answer is:] If it was written @hh<HEB>נהר@ee<ENG> here, we would not know which @hh<HEB>נהר@ee<ENG>, as four @hh<HEB>נהרות@ee<ENG> were mentioned earlier. Thus it says @hh<HEB>יאור@ee<ENG>, meaning the @hh<HEB>נהר@ee<ENG> that has @hh<HEB>יאורים@ee<ENG>. And all other @hh<HEB>נהרות@ee<ENG> are not called @hh<HEB>יאורים@ee<ENG>, only the Nile, as Rashi goes on to explain. The Nile is the Pishon River mentioned in Bereishis, as Rashi explains there. When Rashi says, “All other rivers,” he is referring to the other three @hh<HEB>נהרות@ee<ENG> written in Bereishis. @p1@p2The entire country is made up of man-made canals, and the Nile overflows.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Since this verse is referring to one of the rivers mentioned in Bereishis, why is it not mentioned by its name? [The answer is:] Since Egypt is made up of man-made @hh<HEB>יאורים@ee<ENG>, its river [came to be] called @hh<HEB>יאור@ee<ENG>. But all other rivers [of other countries] are not made up in this manner. @p1[2]@p2<TIE>Symbol of the period of abundance.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Why did Yoseif not interpret the fact that the cows were “fine-looking”? In v. 26 it clearly says he interpreted “well-fleshed,” but his interpretation of “fine-looking” is nowhere mentioned. Rashi answers: Just as he interpreted that the seven good cows mean seven years of abundance, so too he interpreted that “fine-looking” symbolizes the years of abundance. For in a period of abundance, people look finely upon one another: they greet each other pleasantly and provide one another with whatever is lacking. @p1[3]@p2<TIE>Meaning thin.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: How could an animal and its flesh be described as @hh<HEB>דק@ee<ENG> [literally: “fine”]? It should have said @hh<HEB>כיחוש בשר@ee<ENG> (“lean”). Thus Rashi explains: “@ITTenves @itin Old French.” Rashi is saying that in O.F., a lean animal is called @ITtenves, @iteven though @ITtenves @itmeans @hh<HEB>דק@ee<ENG>. Thus in Hebrew, too, a lean animal is called @hh<HEB>דקות בשר@ee<ENG>. Rashi is explaining the word @ITtenves@it when he says, “Meaning thin.” @p1[4]@p2<TIE>Symbolizing that all the joy of the abundant years will be forgotten.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: The cows’ eating can be understood in two ways. Either that the joy will be forgotten in the hunger years, or that there will be food to eat in the hunger years, which is a good sign. How do we know which it is? Thus Rashi explains: “Symbolizing that all the joy.<TIE>.<TIE>. will be forgotten.” This [i.e., Rashi’s] explanation is right, [despite Ramban’s objections] — for later on, we see clearly that Yoseif explained it so. @ITMaharshal@it explains that Rashi [knows this because he] is answering the question: Why does it say the cows “ate”? It should say they “swallowed up” (@hh<HEB>ותבלענה@ee<ENG>), because the term “ate” is not normally used to describe one animal consuming another. Thus Rashi explains: “Symbolizing that all the joy.<TIE>.<TIE>. will be forgotten.” @p1[5]@p2<TIE>@BITudel@BO in O.F.@p3 Rashi is saying that in O.F., a grain stalk is called @ITtudel, @italthough this also means a wooden reed. And so too it is in Hebrew. @p1@p2@BISeines@BO in O.F.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: How could ears of grain be described as @hh<HEB>בריאות@ee<ENG> (literally: “healthy”)? This applies only to animals, as with the cows before. Rashi answers: In O.F., good ears of grain are called @ITseines, @itwhich in Yiddish is @ITfrisch@it. Thus in Hebrew, too, @hh<HEB>בריאות@ee<ENG> can apply to both. @p1[6]@p2<TIE>@BIHasledes @BOin O.F. @boRashi [is answering the question:] @hh<HEB>שידפון@ee<ENG> is a type of disease, affecting only people, not grain. [So why does it say @hh<HEB>שדופות@ee<ENG>]? He answers: In O.F., [afflicted grain] is called @IThasledes, @iteven though this is a human disease. And so it is in Hebrew. Whereas Onkelos does not translate @hh<HEB>שדופות@ee<ENG> as @hh<HEB>שידפון@ee<ENG>, but as @hh<HEB>שקיפן@ee<ENG>, which means “beaten.” So explains @ITRe’m@it. But @ITMaharshal@it writes about this: To me it does not seem so, because in Devarim 28:22 Rashi clearly explains that @hh<HEB>שידפון@ee<ENG> is an epidemic affecting grain. It must be that @hh<HEB>שידפון@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>שדופות@ee<ENG> are different, for Rashi cites a different O.F. word here than he does there. And we cannot say that here Rashi is explaining [it in connection with] the wind, because Rashi there explains differently in connection with the wind. @p1@p2The wind from the east which is called @BIbise@BO [in O.F.]. @boRashi is answering the question: It is implied here that the east wind is bad, while in Yoma 21b it says that the east wind is the best of all winds and it is a sign of blessing for the world. Thus Rashi explains: “The wind from the east which is called @ITbise@it.” Rashi is saying that the east has three kinds of winds, and the one called @ITbise @itis bad. @p1[7]@p2<TIE>A whole dream was complete before him.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., the first time [he woke up] he decided to sleep more, perhaps he will dream more, as in fact happened. But the second awakening was at the end of his sleep, close to morning when he would not sleep more. Thus, the dream was complete and required interpreters. [Alternatively: Rashi knows it means this] because @hh<HEB>והנה@ee<ENG> [usually] indicates the timing, that it happened just now. But here we cannot say it means: “Behold, the dream was completed after he woke,” because the dream was completed even before he woke, when he saw the ears eating the other ones. [Alternatively,] it seems to me [that Rashi explains it so] because after the first dream Pharaoh may have thought it was completed, but it was not — for it says, “As for the dream being repeated twice to Pharaoh, it is because the thing stands ready.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (v. 32). (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1[8]@p2<TIE>It beat within him like a @HB<HEB>פעמון@BO<ENG>.@p3 I.e., @hh<HEB>ותפעם@ee<ENG> comes from @hh<HEB>פעמון@ee<ENG>. His spirit was beating like a clapper within a bell. @p1@p2Bones in Aramaic.@p3 Rashi first explains that @hh<HEB>טימי@ee<ENG> is Aramaic because he seeks to explain @hh<HEB>חרטמי@ee<ENG> as two words: @hh<HEB>חר@ee<ENG>, from @hh<HEB>נחורים@ee<ENG>, and @hh<HEB>טומי@ee<ENG>, from @hh<HEB>טימי@ee<ENG> (bones). @hh<HEB>נחורים@ee<ENG> could be from @hh<HEB>נחירים@ee<ENG> (nostrils), because they would put the bone of a corpse into their nostrils, and it would speak. Or it could be from @hh<HEB>חום@ee<ENG> (heat), as in (Yechezkel 24:10), @hh<HEB>והעצמות יחרו@ee<ENG> (“And the bones will be burnt”). This is because they would put a bone under their armpit and warm it, and it would speak through sorcery.<QC>
@p1@p2He found no relief in their interpretations.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 But when Yoseif told him the land will have a famine, he found relief, saying this is why Hashem showed it to him — so he could properly prepare the country lest they die in the famine. (@ITMaharshal@it) [Alternatively,] he found relief because kings’ dreams are not private matters but matters affecting the whole kingdom, or the whole world, as with the dreams of Nevuchadnezzar. (@ITAkeidah@it) 12@p1@p2 A fool, and is not fit for greatness.@p3 I.e., @hh<HEB>נער@ee<ENG> in gematria@IT @itequals @hh<HEB>שוטה@ee<ENG>. @p1@p2He does not even know our language.@p3 And surely not other languages. And it is written in the laws of Egypt that the ruler must know seventy languages; see Sotah 36b. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1@p2And it is written in the laws of Egypt that a slave can never rule.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because the word “slave” is also superfluous. Once it was said that there was a Hebrew lad in the prison, why mention also that he was a slave? Surely, no Hebrew lad was there other than Yoseif. Perforce, the word “slave” is to be expounded.<QC>
@p1[14]@p2<TIE>From the prison.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi explained this so we will not think that after the butler got out of prison, Yoseif was put into a @hh<HEB>בור@ee<ENG> (i.e., an actual pit). Thus Rashi explains that @hh<HEB>בור@ee<ENG> and prison mean the same. And we need not ask: How does Rashi know this? Perhaps it was an actual pit? For [the answer is:] It is written@hh<HEB>וירצוה מן הבור @ee<ENG>. And @hh<HEB>ריצה@ee<ENG> (literally: “running”) is not the right term for [exiting] a pit. Rather the proper term is @hh<HEB>משיכה@ee<ENG> (pulling out), as it is written (37:28): @hh<HEB>וימשכו את יוסף מן הבור@ee<ENG>. @p1@p2It was made as a sort of pit.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Before it is written (39:20) that they put Yoseif in @ITprison@it, whereas here it is written, “They hurried him out of the @hh<HEB>בור@ee<ENG> (literally: ‘pit’).” Therefore Rashi explains that the prison “was made as a sort of pit.” (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1@p2Even if it does not contain water it is called @HB<HEB>בור@BO<ENG>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because otherwise his clothes would be wet. He obviously would have to change them regardless of respect to royalty. In which case, why does it need to say, “He changed his clothes”? Thus Rashi explains that @hh<HEB>בור@ee<ENG> means prison, so it did not contain water. And why did Yoseif change his clothes? Perforce, out of respect to royalty. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1@p2Out of respect to royalty.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because Yoseif would not have shaved out of celebration, for he did not yet know how he would be judged, as he had not yet come before Pharaoh. And who knows if he would be able to interpret [the dream]?<QC>
@p1[16]@p2<TIE>This wisdom is not mine, but God will answer.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because here it cannot mean as it did in (14:24), “@ITExcept@it (@hh<HEB>בלעדי@ee<ENG>) what the lads have eaten.” Here, how could it mean: “Except for Hashem”? It also cannot mean, “Rather, Hashem will respond,” because Yoseif indeed intended to interpret the dream for him. Perforce, @hh<HEB>בלעדי@ee<ENG> consists of two words: @hh<HEB>בלי@ee<ENG> (not), and @hh<HEB>עדי@ee<ENG>, which means “from me,” as Rashi explains. @p1@p2Meaning lean, as in.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., @hh<HEB>דלות@ee<ENG> does not mean impoverished. @p1@p2All terms of @HB<HEB>רקות@BO<ENG> that appear in Scripture [refer to] lacking of flesh. @boMeaning: the words @hh<HEB>אך@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>רק@ee<ENG> always come to exclude something. Here, too, @hh<HEB>רקות@ee<ENG> comes to exclude. What does it exclude? Flesh. It does not mean @hh<HEB>רֵק@ee<ENG> (empty), because that word is missing the middle letter of the root [and thus would not take a @ITdagesh @itin the @hh<HEB>ק@ee<ENG>]. @p1@p2Onkelos translates it @HB<HEB>נצן לקין@BO<ENG>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo Question: Why does Rashi cite Onkelos, when he already cited a [differing] Aramaic translation, “dry as a stone”? [The answer is:] It seems Rashi is thereby answering a question. Pharaoh had said to Yoseif that the ears were @hh<HEB>צנומות@ee<ENG>, but Yoseif did not interpret this at all. He interpreted only “bad-looking” and “thin” (v. 27). Furthermore, in Pharaoh’s above-stated dream it does not even mention @hh<HEB>צנומות@ee<ENG>. We are forced to say that Pharaoh told him something he never dreamed because he wanted to find out whether Yoseif would interpret correctly. Pharaoh reasoned: if he grasps this, he then understands the [correct] interpretation of the dream. Yoseif grasped it and did not interpret @hh<HEB>צנומות@ee<ENG> at all. Perforce, this is the plain meaning of Scripture. Rashi questions this: how did Yoseif grasp it? Was he a prophet? [To answer this,] Rashi cites the first Aramaic translation of @hh<HEB>צנומות@ee<ENG>, “dry as a stone.” Yoseif reasoned that @hh<HEB>צנומות@ee<ENG> could not have been in the dream because if the curse was to the point of “dry as a stone,” the world could not survive. Yoseif assumed there must have been some moisture. But a question remains: How do we know that @hh<HEB>צנומות@ee<ENG> means “stone”? Perhaps it means @hh<HEB>נצן לקיין@ee<ENG>, [as Onkelos says]? Thus Rashi explains that also Onkelos’ translation conveys lack of moisture, since @hh<HEB>נצן@ee<ENG> means, “They had only the @hh<HEB>נץ@ee<ENG>.<TIE>.<TIE>. no seeds.” (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1[26]@p2<TIE>The dream being repeated twice is because the thing.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Why did Yoseif interpret that this was one dream? Being that one [dream] was with cows and the other with ears, it surely must be two dreams! Therefore Rashi explains that it was [one dream but was] repeated [because of its imminence].<QC>
@p1[31]@p2<TIE>This is the interpretation of “But it could not be recognized.<TIE>.<TIE>.”@p3 You might ask: [Rashi says that @hh<HEB>ולא יודע השבע@ee<ENG> is the interpretation of the good cows being eaten up.] Why did Rashi not explain that @hh<HEB>ונשכח כל השבע@ee<ENG> is the interpretation of the good cows being eaten up? Rather, he says [on v. 30] that @hh<HEB>ונשכח כל השבע@ee<ENG> is the interpretation of the ears of corn being swallowed up. The answer is: @hh<HEB>ולא @hbנודע@hh כי באו אל קרבנה@ee<ENG>, said of the cows in v. 21, is from the root of @hh<HEB>הודעה@ee<ENG>, and so is @hh<HEB>ולא @hbיודע@hh השבע@ee<ENG> here. Therefore, Rashi connects them. However, @hh<HEB>ונשכח@ee<ENG> is not from @hh<HEB>הודעה@ee<ENG>, therefore Rashi connects it with the ears being swallowed up. @p1[32]@p2<TIE>Stands ready.@p3 I.e., the meaning here of @hh<HEB>נכון@ee<ENG> is not the same as in @hh<HEB>אמת @hbנכון@hh הדבר@ee<ENG> (Devarim 13:15), where it means “correct.” @p1[34]@p2<TIE>As Onkelos translates it: and prepare.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., @hh<HEB>וחמש@ee<ENG> does not mean taking a fifth, as Scripture mentions only gathering, which is the preparation. @p1[35]@p2<TIE>And is vocalized with a @BIpatach koton@BO.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo A @ITpatach koton @itis [what we call] a @ITsegol@it, and a @ITkametz koton @itis [what we call] a @ITtzeirei.@it @p1[36]@p2<TIE>That is stored up as any other deposit that has been stored away.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., the food that they wish to save should be like any other deposit. In other words, not that it should be entrusted in the care of an individual, rather it should be stored like a deposit of silver and gold. @p1@p2For @BImaintaining@BO the country. @boI.e., it is not for [maintaining] the soil but for [the survival of] the people.<QC>
@p1[38]@p2<TIE>“Can we find another like this one”.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., the meaning of @hb<HEB>ה@hhנמצא@ee<ENG> here is not the same as in @hb<HEB>ה@hhנהיה כדבר הגדול הזה@ee<ENG> (Devarim 4:32), where it means, “Did such a great thing ever happen in the world?!” Otherwise, Onkelos would have translated it here as @hh<HEB>האשתכח כדין@ee<ENG> (Did something like this ever exist?!) Since he translates it @hh<HEB>הנשכח@ee<ENG>, it means: “If we would go and search, would we find?” Accordingly, the @hh<HEB>נ@ee<ENG> is of the active future tense, not of the passive past tense. Furthermore, if @hb<HEB>ה@hhנמצא@ee<ENG> meant: “Was there ever anyone in the world like this?!” then a question arises: For what purpose did Pharaoh say this? But if it means, “If we would go and search, would we find?” then it is understandable, for Yoseif said, “Pharaoh should seek a man of understanding and wisdom.” Pharaoh thus said to his servants, “If we would go and search, would we find one like him? We should therefore appoint Yoseif for this.” @p1@p2If we would go and search for him, would we find another like him.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi cites Onkelos in order to say that @hh<HEB>הנמצא כזה@ee<ENG> means, “Would we @ITnow@it find one like him,” rather than, “Would one like him @ITever have @itbeen found.” The latter is not true since there was Avraham, Yitzchok and Yaakov. Thus it must mean “now,” and this is seen more clearly from Onkelos: if Onkelos meant, “@ITEver have @itbeen found,” he would have said @hh<HEB>אם @hbאשתכח@hh כדין@ee<ENG> (past tense). But in Scripture, @hh<HEB>הנמצא@ee<ENG> is conjugated in the same manner for both the past tense and the future tense. Onkelos deduced that it is not past tense because it is written@hh<HEB>הנמצא @hbכזה @hhאיש אשר רוח אלקים בו@ee<ENG>, rather than @hh<HEB>הנמצא איש אשר רוח אלקים בו @hbכזה@ee<ENG>. The verse placed @hh<HEB>כזה@ee<ENG> at the beginning in order to connect it with @hh<HEB>איש אשר רוח אלקים@ee<ENG>, conveying that no one has Hashem’s spirit like he does. All this shows that it means, “Would we @ITnow@it find one like him?” (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1[39]@p2<TIE>To seek an understanding and wise man as you suggested.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because if Pharaoh intended to praise Yoseif, why did he do so in Yoseif’s presence, [which is not the way of a king]? Furthermore, why did he not praise him before, when he told him the dream [and Yoseif interpreted it? Rather, Pharaoh first spoke to his servants; see v. 38]. Perforce, Pharaoh is replying to Yoseif’s statement of, “Pharaoh should seek a man of understanding and wisdom,” and he is saying: Hashem’s spirit is in you, as you know about the famine. So too, you will know how to handle it, to gather the grain. @p1[40]@p2<TIE>Shall be fed.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., @hh<HEB>יתזן@ee<ENG> is Onkelos’ translation of @hh<HEB>ישק@ee<ENG>, and means “shall be fed.” Scripture itself does not write [the Hebrew equivalent of] @hh<HEB>יתזן@ee<ENG> because then we might say that Pharaoh appointed Yoseif only over matters pertaining to food. Thus it is written @hh<HEB>ישק@ee<ENG>, which means, “All my people’s needs.<TIE>.<TIE>.”<QC>
@p1[41]@p2 I have appointed you.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: If @hh<HEB>נתתי@ee<ENG> here has its literal meaning of “placing,” why is it written @hb<HEB>על@hh ארץ מצרים@ee<ENG>? It should have written @hb<HEB>ב@hhארץ מצרים@ee<ENG>. Furthermore, Yoseif was already in Egypt. [So why would it say, “I have placed you in Egypt”?] @p1[42]@p2<TIE>Considered very prestigious in Egypt.@p3 The Egyptians worshiped the Nile, which is the Pishon River, so called because it raises linen (@hh<HEB>פשתן@ee<ENG>) — as Rashi explains on Bereishis 2:11. That is why linen garments were prestigious to them. But @ITDevek Tov@it writes: A sage from Eretz Yisrael came and told me that [the @hh<HEB>שש@ee<ENG> mentioned here] does not mean linen. Rather, @hh<HEB>שש@ee<ENG> denotes a prestigious, many-colored garment of silk, worn on top of one’s clothes. It is not the @hh<HEB>שש@ee<ENG> mentioned in connection with the @ITMishkan@it. Rashi’s words lend themselves to his interpretation, because Rashi says @hb<HEB>דבר@hh חשיבות הוא במצרים@ee<ENG> (lit. “It is a prestigious @ITitem@it in Egypt”). If Rashi meant it is linen he should have just said @hh<HEB>בגדי שש — חשיבות הוא במצרים@ee<ENG>. Furthermore, Rashi explains on Shemos 25:4 that @hh<HEB>שש@ee<ENG> means linen, whereas here he does not, and says only that it is a prestigious item.<QC>
@p1@p2On the rows of stones in the Temple Court, refers to the floor.@p3 I.e., it says there [in Yoma 4:3] “on the @hh<HEB>רובד@ee<ENG>” referring to the floor. @p1[43]@p2<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3@hh<HEB>דין אבא למלכא@ee@BO<ENG> @boThis is the king’s colleague. @p1@p2How much longer will you continue to misinterpret Scripture.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., R. Yehudah divides @hh<HEB>אברך@ee<ENG> into two words, which is a stretched explanation. You might ask: Why was this objection not made before, on Onkelos’ translation, “This is the associate of the king?” There as well, @hh<HEB>אב@ee<ENG> means “associate” and @hh<HEB>רך@ee<ENG> means “king,” as Rashi explained. The answer is: There, no extra words needed to be inserted. But here, @hh<HEB>בחכמה@ee<ENG> must inserted after @hh<HEB>אב@ee<ENG>, and @hh<HEB>בשנים@ee<ENG> after @hh<HEB>רך@ee<ENG>, and that is a stretched explanation. @p1@p2Because all would enter before him and leave only with his permission.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., @hh<HEB>אברך@ee<ENG> conveys that all who came to him would say, “I bend my knees to you.”<QC>
@p1@p2He is Potiphar and was called Poti Phera.@p3 Rashi deduced this from the fact that it is written, “Pharaoh gave Yoseif the name.<TIE>.<TIE>.and he gave him Osnas.<TIE>.<TIE>.” That is, Pharaoh gave Osnas to Yoseif. Now, what difference does it make that Pharaoh was the one who gave her to Yoseif? It must be that Poti Phera is Potiphar, and it makes a great difference, as follows: Pharaoh wanted to bestow greatness upon Yoseif and dress him royally. But he feared people would not allow Yoseif this greatness since he was a slave. Furthermore, the laws of Egypt stated that a slave may not rule nor wear prestigious garments. Thus Pharaoh [arranged that Potiphar] give Osnas to Yoseif as a wife. If a master gives his slave a wife, the slave is freed — and surely if he gives him his own daughter. From this we may conclude that Poti Phera is Potiphar. @p1@p2As a result of becoming castrated.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 His castration may be learned from the term @hh<HEB>פרע@ee<ENG> (torn), but not from @hh<HEB>פוטיפר@ee<ENG>. So it seems to me. @p1@p2Because he had lusted to sodomize Yoseif.@p3 You might ask: Earlier it is written, “Your slave did such things to me” (39:19), and Rashi explains there: “She told him this when they were intimate.” And this was well after he bought Yoseif. [Does this not imply that he was not castrated?] The answer is: He did not have actual relations, only an embracing and kissing. And this explains why Rashi used the phrase @hb<HEB>ענייני@hh תשמיש כאלה@ee<ENG> (@ITmatters@it of intimacy such as these), i.e., but not actual relations. Another answer: The castration affected only his testicles and not his membrum, as the @ITRadak@it explains. @p1[47]@p2<TIE>The word does not lose its meaning of doing, making.@p3 [Accordingly,] @hh<HEB>ותעש@ee<ENG> refers to @hh<HEB>הארץ@ee<ENG>, which made storehouses. And @hh<HEB>הארץ@ee<ENG> refers to the people of the land, as in: “When a land sins” (Yechezkel 14:12).<QC>
@p1[48]@p2<TIE>Because every area preserves its produce.@p3 I.e., the verse implies that Yoseif stored all the produce that grew in a town’s area into that specific town. Why? Rashi explains, “Because every area preserves it produce.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1@p2And they put among the grain some of the earth from the place.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 This is an opinion [also from Bereishis Rabboh] which explains it differently: They brought all the produce to [the capital of] Egypt, where Yoseif was. When it is written @hh<HEB>אכל שדה העיר .<TIE>.<TIE>. נתן בתוכה@ee<ENG>, it means they needed to mix into the produce some of the soil from where it grew, but afterwards they would bring it to Egypt [for storage]. @p1[49]@p2<TIE>Until that the counter gave up counting it.@p3 @hh<HEB>כי@ee<ENG> sometimes means @hh<HEB>אשר@ee<ENG> (that), as Rashi explains in many places. [Accordingly, the verse means:] Until that the counter gave up counting.<QC>
@p1@p2Here @HB<HEB>כי@BO<ENG> means because. @bo[Meaning:] @hh<HEB>חדל@ee<ENG> implies that the counter decided on his own to give up, [but could have continued]. Why did he not count more? “Because there were no numbers.” I.e., he knew he will surely run out of numbers because there was so much — thus he gave up from the beginning. (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1[50]@p2<TIE>That a person may not have marital relations during years of famine.@p3 Although it is written (v. 54), “There was famine in all the lands, but in all the land of Egypt @ITthere was bread@it,” perforce it means there was famine in all the lands even in their storehouses. But in Egypt there was bread in the storehouses [of Yoseif]. Although Yitzchok had relations during a famine year (26:8), it was already explained [that in Gerar there was no famine]. @ITRe’m@it asks: Did not Leivi have relations during famine years? Yocheved was born to him as they entered Egypt, as Rashi explains on 46:15, and there was famine then. The answer is: One who is childless may have relations even during years of famine.<QC>
@p1[55]@p2<TIE>Because Yoseif was telling them to be circumcised.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi deduced this because it is written @hh<HEB>אשר @hbיאמר@hh לכם תעשו@ee<ENG>. Why is it written @hh<HEB>אשר יאמר@ee<ENG> (“whatever he says”), rather than @hh<HEB>אשר יצוה@ee<ENG> )“whatever he commands”)? Perforce, @hh<HEB>אמירה@ee<ENG> implies circumcision, as David says (Tehillim 119:162): “I rejoice over Your word (@hh<HEB>אמרתך@ee<ENG>),” [referring to circumcision]. The commentators discussed this at length; see there.<QC>
@p1[56]@p2<TIE>Who are referred to as @HB<HEB>פני הארץ@BO<ENG>? The wealthy people.@p3 But the poor people lower their faces to the ground and do not lift their faces. @p1@p2Because we find it also in regard to wine and milk: “And go buy.<TIE>.<TIE>.”@p3 This is what Rashi means. We should not ask: Although @hh<HEB>שבר@ee<ENG> means selling, it also means grain. And since it is written @hh<HEB>שבר@ee<ENG> here, perhaps pertaining only to grain can @hh<HEB>שבר@ee<ENG> be used to mean selling, because the meaning of the word @hh<HEB>שבר@ee<ENG> applies [only] to grain? But regarding wine and other liquids, @hh<HEB>שבר@ee<ENG> cannot be used since its meaning of “grain” is not applicable to them. Rashi answers: [This is not so,] “because we find it also in regard to wine.<TIE>.<TIE>.”<QC>
@p1[1]@p2<TIE>Why do you show yourselves.<TIE>.<TIE>. as though you are satiated?”@p3 Meaning: If you show yourselves to them as being satiated and having grain, they will come and ask us for food, since they are our relatives. Therefore, go and buy food so they will think we have no food. But in fact they did have food at the time. Accordingly, @hh<HEB>תתראו@ee<ENG> means satiation.<QC>
@p1@p2Similar to: @HB<HEB>ומרוה גם הוא יורא@BO<ENG>. The @hh<HEB>א@ee<ENG> of @hh<HEB>תתר@hbא@hhו@ee<ENG> replaces the @hh<HEB>ו@ee<ENG> of the root @hh<HEB>ר–ו–ה@ee<ENG>. There are many similar examples. The verse means: He who satisfies others with his learning in this world will himself be satisfied in the World to Come. You might ask: How is this proof for the last explanation, that @hh<HEB>תתראו@ee<ENG> is a term for leanness? On the contrary, it is a proof that it means satiation! The answer is: Rashi is bringing a proof for both explanations. For the first explanation, the plain meaning is a valid proof. And for the last explanation too it is a proof: @hh<HEB>תתראו@ee<ENG> is like @hh<HEB>תתרוו@ee<ENG>, but it means “not satiated.” This is similar to Rashi’s explanation of @hh<HEB>הולך ערירי@ee<ENG> (15:2) as “childless,” although @hh<HEB>ער@ee<ENG> means an heir, i.e., one who has sons. And it is also similar to what is written @hh<HEB>ודשנו את המזבח@ee<ENG> (Bamidbar 4:13), where Rashi explains: “They shall @ITtake away@it the ashes from the Altar,” although @hh<HEB>דשן@ee<ENG> means ashes. The same is true here. It is as if Scripture had written @hh<HEB>תתרוו@ee<ENG> since an @hh<HEB>א@ee<ENG> can be replaced by a @hh<HEB>ו@ee<ENG>, because the letters @hh<HEB>א–ה–ו–י@ee<ENG> are interchangeable. Thus @hh<HEB>מרוה@ee<ENG>, too, could mean “satiation,” yet will fit exactly with @hh<HEB>תתראו@ee<ENG>. Accordingly, the meaning of @hh<HEB>ומרוה גם הוא יורא@ee<ENG> is: He who is not satiated in this world will be satiated in the World to Come. @p1[2]@p2<TIE>This alludes to the 210 years.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 The correct text of Rashi omits, “He did not say @hh<HEB>לכו@ee<ENG> but rather @hh<HEB>רדו@ee<ENG>.” This is because no teaching can be derived from @hh<HEB>רדו@ee<ENG>. Scripture needs to write @hh<HEB>רדו@ee<ENG> (go down) — for Eretz Yisrael is higher than the other lands, so @hh<HEB>רדו@ee<ENG> is the right term for going from Eretz Yisrael to Egypt, as @ITRe’m@it writes. And so the term @hh<HEB>ירידה@ee<ENG> is written in the entire section@IT. @it Rashi is answering the question: Why does Scripture need to write, “Go down @ITthere@it”? It is written right afterward, “And buy for us from there.” Thus it should just say, “Go down and buy for us from there.” Perforce, it is written @hh<HEB>רדו שמה@ee<ENG> (Go down there) to allude that they will be there (@hh<HEB>שמה@ee<ENG>) for 210 (@hh<HEB>רד''ו@ee<ENG>) years. But without the word “there,” we would be unable to expound anything. Alternatively, we could say that the correct text of Rashi includes, “He did not say @hh<HEB>לכו@ee<ENG> but rather @hh<HEB>רדו@ee<ENG>,” and Rashi is answering the question: Why is it written @hh<HEB>רדו@ee<ENG>, which connotes downfall? It should use the favorable term of @hh<HEB>לכו@ee<ENG> (go). Despite Eretz Yisrael being higher than the other lands, it should not use a term which connotes downfall. Perforce, “This alludes to the 210 years.<TIE>.<TIE>.”<QC>
@p17@p2<TIE>He acted as a @HB<HEB>נכרי@BO<ENG> to them.@p3 I.e., @hh<HEB>ויתנכר@ee<ENG> means he acted like a stranger (@hh<HEB>נכרי@ee<ENG>).<QC>
@p1[9]@p2<TIE>Onkelos translates it: @HB<HEB>בדקא דארעא@BO<ENG> as in  @HB<HEB>בדק הבית@BO<ENG>.<TIE>.<TIE>. @boMeaning: breach in the [wall of the] town. @p1[10]@p2<TIE>Do not say this (@HB<HEB>לא תאמר כן@BO<ENG>).<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi added in the words@hh<HEB>תאמר כן @ee<ENG> (say this) because Yoseif had declared them as spies, so the proper word [to deny this] would be @hh<HEB>אַל@ee<ENG>. So we see with Channah (Shmuel I, 1:16). Eli thought she was a drunk, and she replied [in denial]: @hb<HEB>אַל@hh תתן אמתך לפני בת בליעל@ee<ENG>. Whereas @hh<HEB>לא@ee<ENG> [when standing alone] is the proper reply to a question or a request. @p1@p2Rather, “Your servants have come to buy food.”@p3 This statement is not a proof [that they are not spies, which we see] because Yoseif replied, “No, rather, you have come to spy the land.” This is what the verse means: Do not say this. Rather, [the point is that] your servants have come to buy food. It is like saying @hh<HEB>אבל עבדיך@ee<ENG>. @p1[12]@p2<TIE>Why did you not all enter through one gate?@p3 Yoseif knew his brothers would come to buy food, and he told the guards of the gates to write the name and father’s name of whoever came to the city, and show it to him. Ten guards came and he found here, “Reuven son of Yaakov,” and there, “Shimon ben Yaakov,” and so in every record book. Thus he knew they entered through ten gates. You might ask: Why did Rashi not explain this before, on: “You have come to see where the land is exposed” (v. 9)? The answer is: The proof for it is here, because it is written in the next verse, “Your servants are twelve brothers.<TIE>.<TIE>. and one is no more.” How did this refute his assertion that they were spies? Perforce, Yoseif had said, “[You are spies,] for you entered through ten different gates of the city,” to which they replied, “No, rather we are all the sons of one man.<TIE>.<TIE>. and one is no more.” And it was because of the one who is no more that we scattered throughout the city in order to search for him, [as Rashi explains on v. 9]. @p1[14]@p2<TIE>The statement that I made, that you are spies.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Does the verse not imply that the brothers, too, said they were spies? For we find Yoseif responding to them, “That is just what I said.<TIE>.<TIE>. you are spies.” Yet this cannot be true, for they said, “Your servants have never been spies.” Rashi answers: The word “that” (@hh<HEB>הוא@ee<ENG>) belongs at the end of the sentence. [Accordingly,] the verse means: “What I said to you, saying you are spies, @ITthat@it is the truth.” Some ask: What was it that led Yoseif to accuse them of being spies, causing him to say, “That is just what I said.<TIE>.<TIE>. you are spies”? Another question: How would bringing Binyamin verify that they were not spies? The answer is: First he said to them, “You are spies, for you entered through ten different gates of the city,” as Rashi explained. They replied, “We are all the sons of one man, and a man does not send all his sons together to spy, lest they be caught and all killed.” He said to them, “According to this, you surely are spies. Would a man send all his sons [to buy food] without leaving one or two to serve him? Perforce, your father sent [some of] you to spy the land, but since [each of] you was afraid to be caught and did not want to [be the one to] take the chance, your father was obliged to send all of you. Furthermore, he did this so that you could take counsel from ten, because “Salvation results from much counsel” (Mishlei 11:14). To this they replied, “Your servants are twelve brothers, and behold, the youngest one stayed with our father to serve him, while the ten of us went to search for our lost brother. None would do this as faithfully as his own brothers. We risked our lives to bring him back to his father, and entered through ten gates.” Yoseif replied, “That is just what I said to you. You are spies. You claim your brother is missing for many years, but you did not search for him until now! Surely you are lying, and you came to spy. And it is also a lie that you left one brother with your father to serve him. Therefore, you shall be tested in this manner. If your brother comes with you, it is questionable whether you are spies. But if he does not come, you definitely are spies, for the reasons I stated.” This answers all the questions. In the name of @ITMaharshal@it I found somewhat similar to this.<QC>
@p1[15]@p2<TIE>If Pharaoh lives.@p3 If understood literally, [@hh<HEB>חי פרעה@ee<ENG> means “Pharaoh’s life,” then the verse is not understandable. Thus Rashi added the word “if” (@hh<HEB>אם@ee<ENG>) so that it means, “If Pharaoh lives you shall not leave from here.” Accordingly, @hh<HEB>אם@ee<ENG> conveys a negative. It is like @hb<HEB>אם@hh לדוד אכזב@ee<ENG> (Tehillim 89:36), which means, “I will @ITnot@it lie to David.” From our verse it follows that if you do leave, Pharaoh will not live. Yet, they left [with Yoseif’s permission], proving that “Whenever he swore falsely [he would swear by Pharaoh’s life].” @p1[16]@p2<TIE>Whether there is truth with you.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: @hh<HEB>האמת אתכם@ee<ENG> seems to show that Yoseif admitted that the truth was with them. But does this not contradict, “Your words will be tested,” which shows that he was in doubt about them? Thus Rashi said that the @hh<HEB>ה@ee<ENG> is in question form, conveying: “Is it so?” @p1@p2If you do not @BIbring him@BO, then by Pharaoh’s life, you are spies. @bo[Rashi knows this] because it cannot mean that “If you are not @ITtested@it, then by Pharaoh’s life, you are spies.” For even if they are not tested, they are not necessarily spies. @p1[17]@p2<TIE>Prison.@p3 I.e., @hh<HEB>משמר@ee<ENG> does not mean that he merely placed guards (@hh<HEB>שומרים@ee<ENG>) over them, for in v. 19 it is written @hh<HEB>יֵאָסֵר בבית משמרכם@ee<ENG> (@ITimprisoned@it in your place of @hh<HEB>משמר@ee<ENG>). Rashi did not explain on 41:10 that @hh<HEB>משמר@ee<ENG> means prison because there it is clearly written in 40:3 that it was a @hh<HEB>בית הסוהר@ee<ENG> (jail). @p1[19]@p2<TIE>In which you are now imprisoned.@p3 [Rashi explains this] so we will not think that @hh<HEB>משמר@hbכם@ee<ENG> (@ITyour @itplace of guarding) means that it was made especially for them. @p1@p2That you bought for the hunger of the people of your household.@p3 [Here,] @hh<HEB>שבר@ee<ENG> denotes buying, not selling. And since hunger is not applicable to their houses, Rashi added “@ITthe people @itof your houses.” @p1[20]@p2<TIE>Will be shown to be true.<TIE>.<TIE>. as in: @HB<HEB>אמן אמן@BO<TIE><ENG>.<TIE>.<TIE>. @boRashi is saying that @hh<HEB>ויאמנו@ee<ENG> does not mean “faithful” (@hh<HEB>אמונה@ee<ENG>). It means “true,” as in: “And the woman shall say @hh<HEB>אמן@ee<ENG>.<TIE>.<TIE>. (Bamidbar 5:22). For the @ITkohein @itsays [to the @ITsotah@it], “Adonoy shall make you a curse and an oath.<TIE>.<TIE>.” and then it is written, “And the woman shall say @hh<HEB>אמן@ee<ENG>.” There, @hh<HEB>אמן@ee<ENG> cannot mean “faithful.” It can mean only it will be “true” that her thigh will collapse, etc.<QC>
@p1[23]@p2<TIE>When they spoke.<TIE>.<TIE>. the interpreter was between them.@p3 I.e., whenever they spoke with Yoseif previously, the interpreter was among them. But now the interpreter was not there, and they thought Yoseif did not understand Hebrew. @p1[24]@p2<TIE>Because he heard that they had regrets.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Why did he cry? He should have been angry with them, as he heard that they themselves admitted that they did wrong. Therefore Rashi explains that he cried because he heard that they had regrets. (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1@p2The one that threw him into the pit, he was the one who said to Leivi.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi deduced this because it is written [prior to throwing him into the pit]: “A man said to his @ITbrother@it, ‘Here comes the dreamer.<TIE>.<TIE>.’” (37:19). And it is written in 49:5, “Shimon and Leivi are @ITbrothers@it.” (@ITRe’m@it) [You might object: Did Shimon alone throw him in?] Is it not written (37:24), “@ITThey@it took him (@hh<HEB>ויקחהו@ee<ENG>) and threw him into the pit,” in the plural form? The answer is: @hh<HEB>ויקחהו@ee<ENG> is written with the middle @hh<HEB>ו@ee<ENG> missing, so we [could] read it @hh<HEB>ויקחֵהו@ee<ENG>, in the singular form. @p1@p2He bound him only while he was seen by them.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Otherwise, why does it say, “Before their eyes?” @p1[27]@p2<TIE>This was Leivi because he was left alone.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows it was Leivi] because otherwise, why does it say, “@ITThe@it one”?<QC>
@p1@p2At the place they stayed overnight.@p3 [Rashi is saying:] Do not think that since it is written @hh<HEB>בַמלון@ee<ENG> [rather than @hh<HEB>בְמלון@ee<ENG>] it means the place set for all wayfarers to stay. For if so Scripture should have written, “They came @ITto@it the @hh<HEB>מלון@ee<ENG>,” and only afterward say, “The one opened his sack.<TIE>.<TIE>.at the @hh<HEB>מלון@ee<ENG>.” @p1@p2It is the sack.@p3 Rashi says, “It is the sack,” rather than simply saying, “Sack,” because he is answering the question: At the beginning of the verse it is written, “One of them opened his @ITsack@it.” And afterwards it is written, “For behold it was in the opening of his @ITbag@it.” Does this not imply it was not the [abovementioned] sack? Thus Rashi explains, “It is the sack.” In other words, the bag mentioned here is the same sack mentioned before. @p1@p2To cause us to be falsely accused.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Accordingly, “What is this?” means: “What evil is this?” It does not mean, “What good [is this, that our money was returned]?” Otherwise, why does it say, “And they trembled”?<QC>
@p1[34]@p2<TIE>You will travel around.@p3 You might ask: Where do you find that Yoseif said this to them? The answer is: Since Yoseif accused them of being spies, he did not let them roam about the city in order to prevent them from spying. But if they bring Binyamin and will thus no longer be suspect of spying, they will be allowed to roam about the city. This relates back to (v. 20), “So that your words will be verified.” The meaning of @hh<HEB>תסחרו@ee<ENG> is “to roam about,” and not, “to do business (@hh<HEB>סחורה@ee<ENG>).” Otherwise, how is it connected to the narrative? @p1[36]@p2<TIE>This teaches that he suspected them of killing him or selling him as they did to Yoseif.@p3 You might ask: It is implied that now, when they asked for Binyamin to go down with them, that Yaakov realized they had sold Yoseif, [or killed him]. If so, why did he later say to them (44:27-28): “You know that.<TIE>.<TIE>. surely he is torn to pieces,” [i.e., by a wild beast]? (@ITRe’m@it) This is not a question because nowhere do we find Yaakov saying, “Surely he is torn to pieces,” to his sons. It was only Yehudah who said this to Yoseif, in his father’s name. Yehudah might have fabricated it to evoke Yoseif’s mercy, just as Yehudah also said, “His brother is dead” (v. 20), on which Rashi explains that fear brought Yehudah to utter an untruth. The proof [that Yehudah fabricated it] is that Yaakov said here in v. 38, “My son will not go down with you; for his brother is @ITdead@it.” He did not say, “Torn to pieces.” (@ITTzeidah Laderech@it)<QC>
@p1[38]@p2<TIE>He did not accept Reuvein’s offer.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [How does Rashi know this? The answer is:] It was not because misfortune might befall Binyamin that Yaakov prevented him from going with them, although the verse states as much. Because if so, why did Yaakov not say he feared misfortune might occur on the way, when Yehudah offered (43:9), “I will be security for him”? Perforce, the argument of misfortune was merely an excuse, as Yaakov did not want to shame Reuvein by rejecting his offer. The reason he rejected Reuvein’s offer was he feared the master of the land would imprison Binyamin, as he did to Shimon, and no one could stop it. But when Yehudah assumed responsibility when he offered to take Binyamin, Yaakov allowed it because he knew that if Yehudah was involved, he would utterly dedicate himself to rescue Binyamin.<QC>
2@p1@p2 Yehudah had told them, “Wait.<TIE>.<TIE>.”@p3 Otherwise, why did only Yehudah reply to, “Go back and buy a little food,” when this was said to them all? Perforce, [it is as Rashi explained]. @p1[3]@p2<TIE>“You will not see me without your brother with you.”@p3 Rashi is answering the question: In all of Scripture, @hh<HEB>בלתי@ee<ENG> means “rather.” So why is it not written @hh<HEB>בלתי @hbכאשר@hh אחיכם אתכם@ee<ENG> (rather, you will see me @ITwhen@it your brother is with you)? Therefore Rashi says that here, @hh<HEB>בלתי@ee<ENG> means “without.” (@ITRe’m@it) [Rashi is saying] that we should not think it means, “You will not see me; rather, your brother alone will see me.” Thus he explains that it means: “You will not see me without your brother with you.” (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1@p2Explained the thing so that it fits, but was not meticulous to translate it literally.@p3 I.e., Onkelos translates @hh<HEB>בלתי@ee<ENG> as “rather,” and he adds @hh<HEB>כד@ee<ENG>, which means “that.” This is non-literal, because [if Onkelos is translating literally,] the word @hh<HEB>כד@ee<ENG> is added to the verse — and that is a forced explanation. @p1[7]@p2<TIE>Even the type of wood of our childhood cradles he revealed to us.@p3 I.e., even the small children lying in a cradle. [Rashi knows this] because it is written @hh<HEB>מולדתנו@ee<ENG>, which alludes to the cradles in which the children (@hh<HEB>ילדים@ee<ENG>) lie. @p1@p2That we have a father and a brother.@p3 [Rashi inserts these words into the verse] because @hh<HEB>על פי הדברים האלה@ee<ENG> means, “According to his questions.” It follows that @hh<HEB>ונגד לו@ee<ENG> means, “We told him @ITsuch and such@it, according to his questions.” However, if the verse meant, “We told him the questions he asked, ‘Do you have a father and a brother?’” then it should simply say @hh<HEB>ונגד לו את הדברים האלה@ee<ENG>. @p1[8]@p2<TIE>He had a spark of Divine prophecy.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Since Yehudah said, “And not die,” obviously he means they will live. So why did he say, “Let us live”? Perforce, [it is as Rashi explained]. @p1@p2Whereas, we will certainly die of hunger if we do not go.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Why did Yehudah reply, “Let us.<TIE>.<TIE>. not die”? That is why Yaakov is sending them — to buy grain! Thus Rashi explains that “Let us.<TIE>.<TIE>. not die” conveys: “Concerning Binyamin, it is doubtful .<TIE>.<TIE>. @ITwe will certainly die@it of hunger.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1[10]@p2<TIE>You would not have had to suffer all these days.@p3 Otherwise, what difference does it make that they could have returned twice? Perforce, it means we would have returned with Shimon and you would have been spared all your suffering until now.<QC>
@p1[12]@p2<TIE>Twice as much as the first time.@p3 I.e., it does not mean a second sum of money, besides what was returned, [and equal to it. For if so, it should first say, “The money that was returned,”] and then say, “Double the money.”<QC>
@p1[14]@p2<TIE>Now you are lacking nothing except prayer.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., Yaakov said to them: If on his own he grows angry and harasses you, it is a natural occurrence. Appease him with these fruits which are the best of the land. And if this does not appease him, it is surely caused by Hashem. Then, prayer alone is lacking — and “I, hereby, pray for you.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1@p2Until your return, I will possibly be bereft of children.@p3 [This is how Rashi knew that] it does not mean, “Now I am bereft of children”: because if so, why did he say, “May the Almighty, Shaddai, grant you compassion.<TIE>.<TIE>.”?<QC>
@p1[16]@p2<TIE>@HB<HEB>טבוח@BO<ENG> is not an imperative for then it should have said @HB<HEB>וטבח@BO<ENG>.@p3 And then it would be like (Shemos 4:4): @hh<HEB>שלח ידך@ee<ENG> (Stretch out your hand), and (Shemos 9:19): @hh<HEB>שלח העז@ee<ENG> (Now send word and gather), which are imperatives. @p1@p2Which, in Aramaic, means the first meal.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., in the morning. Onkelos does not explain @hh<HEB>צהרים@ee<ENG> here as he does elsewhere because people usually eat at the fourth hour, [the middle of the morning]. Even Torah scholars, [who wait the longest,] usually eat at the beginning of the sixth hour, [an hour before noon] — as it says in Shabbos 10a. @p1[18]@p2<TIE>According to Onkelos who translates as @HB<HEB>ולאסתקפא עלנא@BO<ENG>.<TIE>.<TIE>. @boI.e., this translation is for @hh<HEB>ולהתנפל@ee<ENG>. @p1@p2@HB<HEB>ולהתגולל@BO<ENG>, which he translates as @HB<HEB>לאתרברבא@BO<TIE><ENG>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 The word @hh<HEB>לאתרברבא@ee<ENG> denotes “lordship.” You might ask: Is this translation not contrary to the [simple] meaning of @hh<HEB>להתגולל@ee<ENG>? And why does he translate [@hh<HEB>להתנפל@ee<ENG>] as “to libel,” which is not in accordance with the plain meaning of the verse? The answer is: Onkelos started by explaining @hh<HEB>להתגולל@ee<ENG> as “lordship,” based on the verse @hh<HEB>גלת הזהב@ee<ENG>. As a result, @hh<HEB>להתנפל@ee<ENG> is understandable only if we explain it as “to libel.” Had @hh<HEB>להתגולל@ee<ENG> meant “to turn things against,” following its plain meaning, then @hh<HEB>להתנפל@ee<ENG> could mean “to come down upon.” But since @hh<HEB>להתגולל@ee<ENG> means “lordship,” @hh<HEB>להתנפל@ee<ENG> must mean “libel.” (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1[20]@p2<TIE>A “come down” for us.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi deduces this from the repetitious @hh<HEB>ירד ירדנו@ee<ENG> and not because it is written “coming down” instead of “going,” as he explained on @hh<HEB>רדו שמה@ee<ENG> (42:2), see there. Although [the repetition could be explained simply because] the Torah speaks as people do, however we expound the verse when we have the opportunity to do so. (@ITRe’m@it)<QC>
@p1[28]@p2<TIE>Prostration upon the ground.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because it is written in 42:6, “And they prostrated themselves (@hh<HEB>וישתחוו@ee<ENG>) to him with their faces to the ground.”<QC>
@p1[2]@p2<TIE>@HB<HEB>גביע@BO<ENG> is a tall goblet.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Since it is written @hh<HEB>גביע@ee<ENG> twice, Rashi deduced that it means a @ITtall@it cup. We need not ask: Why was Yoseif not concerned they would [later] claim the goblet was theirs? Because [the answer is:] It was for divination, so surely it was [not theirs but] Yoseif’s. For it says, “There is no divination amongst Yaakov” (Bamidbar 23:23). (@ITauthor’s commentary@it) @p1[7]@p2<TIE>May God spare us from doing such a thing.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Implying,] since we have not done it. @ITRe’m@it asks: On @hh<HEB>חלילה לך מעשות כדבר הזה@ee<ENG> (18:25), Onkelos translates @hh<HEB>חלילה@ee<ENG> as @hh<HEB>קושטא@ee<ENG> (truth). [Why does he translate it here differently?] @ITRe’m@it answers: [There, it refers to Hashem. And] being “spared” is not applicable to Hashem, since He is not subject to the mercy of others.<QC>
@p1[10]@p2<TIE>This, too, would be only just. Truly it should be as you say.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi means as follows: “Your words are now also correct,” does not relate back to [their statement of,] “He among your servants with whom it is found, @IThe@it shall die.” This is because, “When there are ten persons and a stolen item is found in the possession of one of them,” they all deserve @ITequal@it punishment [by the king’s law], whatever the punishment may be. That is why Rashi says, “You are @ITall@it responsible.” Although they had said, “He shall die,” in their bitterness they exaggerated. [Rashi elaborated because] we might think that, “He.<TIE>.<TIE>. shall die,” is what is intended by, “Your words are now also correct.” But this is not so, for [in v. 16, when] the brothers [speak to Yoseif himself, they] do not say this, [that he shall die. Perforce, it was an exaggeration]. Rashi added, “Not according to the strict letter of the law; only he with whom it was found shall be my slave,” because it was not strictly according to the law [to punish only one of them]. @p1[15]@p2<TIE>Through knowledge, reason .<TIE>.<TIE>. that you stole the goblet.@p3 I.e., although you stole the goblet I divine with, so how could I have known that you stole it? Common sense should have told you that, “A man like me.<TIE>.<TIE>.”<QC>
@p1[18]@p2<TIE>May my words penetrate your ears.@p3 [How does Rashi know it does not mean that Yehudah literally requested to whisper in Yoseif’s ear? The answer is:] They spoke to Yoseif only through an interpreter, as they did not know he understood Hebrew. So how could Yehudah speak directly to Yoseif? Another answer: It is not a king’s honor for a lowly person to whisper in his ear. (@ITRe’m@it) @p1@p2From this you may infer that he spoke harshly to him.@p3 I.e., not gently and politely as one usually speaks to a king. Otherwise, why should Yoseif grow angry? @p1@p2You are as esteemed in my eyes as a king.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 From this it follows that “For you are equal to Pharaoh” explains why Yehudah said to him, “Please my master,” by which Yehudah pleaded and supplicated to him, although Yoseif was not a king. Thus Yehudah said [in explanation]: “For you are equal to Pharaoh,” i.e., “You are as esteemed in my eyes as a king.” However, “For you are equal to Pharaoh” does not explain Yehudah’s statement of, “And do not be angry,” which he had previously made. On the contrary, since Yoseif was as esteemed as a king, this is a reason for Yehudah @ITnot@it to speak harshly to him, [so Yoseif’s anger would be justified]. @p1@p2Its Midrashic explanation is: “Ultimately you will be stricken.<TIE>.<TIE>.”@p3 [Although the simple meaning is, “You are as esteemed in my eyes as a king”], the Midrash preferred not to say that Yehudah was speaking gently, rather that he was speaking harshly. Thus it explains, “Ultimately you will be stricken.<TIE>.<TIE>.” But there is a question on the Midrash: Why did it not say, “For you @ITwill@it be like Pharaoh”? Thus Rashi offers another explanation: “Just as Pharaoh issues decrees.<TIE>.<TIE>.” I.e., right now you are like Pharaoh. But there is a question regarding this explanation: Why did it not say @hh<HEB>אתה כפרעה@ee<ENG>? Thus, both explanations are needed. And there is a question regarding all the [above] explanations: Why did it not say @hh<HEB>כפרעה כמוך@ee<ENG>, since Yoseif was being compared to Pharaoh? Thus Rashi offers another explanation: “If you will provoke me.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Now, Pharaoh is compared to Yoseif as regards being killed. But this explanation is implausible on its own because how could Yehudah have said, “Do not be angry,” when he was threatening to kill him? That is why the above explanations are also needed. (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1@p2As the Pharaoh was stricken.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 From this it follows that “For you are equal to Pharaoh” is connected to, “Let your servant speak a word in my master’s ears.” And what is the [harsh] word that I will speak to you? “For you are equal to Pharaoh,” meaning that “ultimately you will be stricken.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1@p2Just as Pharaoh issues decrees without carrying them out.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Meaning: Pharaoh wrote in his register that a slave may not rule nor may he wear silk garments, yet he did not carry it out because he made you a ruler though you were a slave. And “he makes promises without fulfilling them,” i.e., if he did not carry out his decree where there is no monetary loss, surely he will not carry out a promise where there is monetary loss. You, too, do the same. You promise and do not fulfill, for is this [the meaning of, “Set your eyes on him?”] “You, too, do the same” does not refer to issuing decrees without carrying them out, for nowhere do we see Yoseif issuing a decree and not carry it out. And nowhere do we see Pharaoh making a promise and not keep it. You might ask: What did Yehudah have against Pharaoh, that he so denigrated the king? The answer is: Yehudah was saying to Yoseif, “On what do you rely? Do you place your trust in Pharaoh [to protect you from our retribution]? Pharaoh himself issues decrees but does not carry them out, as he wrote in Egypt’s laws that a slave may not be a ruler yet he did not carry it out.” (@ITMaharshal@it)<QC>
@p1@p2If you will provoke me I will kill you.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 From this it follows that “For you are equal to Pharaoh” is connected to, “Do not be angry with your servant,” for if you get angry, I will kill you and your master. @p1[19]@p2<TIE>From the start you encountered us with subterfuge.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Why did Yehudah tell Yoseif what Yoseif had spoken to him? Did Yoseif not know what he said? Rashi answers: He repeated it in order to say, “From the start you encountered us with subterfuge.” @p1@p2Why did you need to ask all these question? Were we seeking your daughter.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because only concerning marriage do people ask about sons and daughters and fathers and mothers. You might ask: Why does Rashi say “your daughter” pertaining to Yoseif, and “our sister” pertaining to his brothers, and not the opposite, since the brothers were older than Yoseif? The answer is: Since Yoseif was esteemed in their eyes as a king, they said, “Were we seeking your daughter.” For a son-in-law usually honors his father-in-law. Similarly with, “Were you seeking our sister,” i.e., we would need to treat you with honor so that it will be well with our sister. But the opposite would be a disgrace to Yoseif as a king, for Yoseif would need to honor them. @p1@p2Nevertheless, “We said to my master” — we withheld nothing from you.@p3 Rashi explains this so we will not ask: If Yehudah knew that Yoseif was acting with subterfuge, why did he answer him, “We have an old father.<TIE>.<TIE>.”? Rashi answers: Yehudah was saying, “Nevertheless .<TIE>.<TIE>. [we acted respectfully and withheld nothing from you].”<QC>
@p1[20]@p2<TIE>He thought, “If I tell him that he is alive, he will say, ‘Bring him to me.’”@p3 You might ask: On the contrary, was Yehudah not contradicting himself? When they had come previously to Yoseif, they said he was still alive but had been sold, as it says, “And one is no more” (42:13). The answer is: The first time they came, they said, “And one is no more.” But the second time they came, they were saying that he had died, and this verse pertains to [what they were saying] the second time. Although it is not expressly written that Yoseif asked [now for details] about their lost brother, we can still say that he asked, as we anyway have to say [something similar to] this. It is written here that Yoseif had said to them, “Bring him down to me, that I may set my eyes on him.” But we do not find it written previously that Yoseif had said this to them. Perforce, he must have said it to them although it is not written previously. And the same is true here: the second time they came, when he asked about their father, he inquired also about their lost brother — and they replied that he had died. [They so replied] out of fear. They saw he had told them to bring Binyomin, and perhaps he would tell them to search for the lost brother and bring him. So they replied that after having searched for him, they received word that he had died. @p1@p2From that mother he has no other brother.@p3 I.e., @hh<HEB>לאמו@ee<ENG> means “of his mother,” [not “to his mother”]. This is because “to his mother” can be said only if the mother is alive. But after her death, one says that he remains “of his mother.”<QC>
@p1[22]@p2<TIE>He may die en route for his mother, too, died while en route.@p3 Question: If it is [as Rashi explains,] why did Yehudah say the danger depended on leaving his father? [According to Rashi,] even if his father would come with him, he should not go, due to the hardships of traveling — as Rochel [his mother] had died in Yaakov’s presence. A further question: Why did Yehudah mention [the factor of] leaving his father, while Yaakov had said (42:4), “Misfortune might befall him” due to the hardships of traveling and the weakness it causes; [see Rashi there]? (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it)<QC>
@p1[29]@p2<TIE>As long as he is beside me I find comfort through him.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Why is it written here that on account of Binyomin [Yaakov said], “You will bring my white head down to the grave in evil,” whereas in 37:35 it is written [that Yaakov said] a similar phrase on account of Yoseif? It is written there, “I will go down to the grave mourning for my son [Yoseif].” Rashi answers: Because of Yoseif, they indeed had already brought Yaakov down to the grave in mourning. But now, “As long [as Binyomin is beside me I find comfort through him].” Alternatively, Rashi is answering the question: Why would Yaakov be more sorrowful for Binyomin than for Rochel, Yoseif or Shimon? @p1@p2Of his mother and his brother.@p3 You might ask: How does Rashi know that it refers also to Rochel, when she is not mentioned in the verses? The answer is: It is written (v. 27), “Two sons were born to me by my wife [Rochel].” This conveys, “Two sons were born to me from her, and she is my wife” — i.e., she especially is my wife, [more than Leah]. This is because Yaakov lived mainly with Rochel. This verse implies that he mourned for Rochel but was comforted through Yoseif. And when Yoseif died, leaving Binyomin, he was comforted through him for both. “And if he dies, it will seem to me as if all three died the same day.” But it seems to me that [the answer is:] It is written here, “You will bring my white head down to the grave in @ITevil@it,” whereas in 42:38 it [merely] is written, “You will bring my white head down to the grave in @ITsorrow@it.” Accordingly, Yaakov was saying: until now I found comfort for the loss of his mother. But now I will no longer be comforted for her, thus I will go down in @ITevil@it to the grave. This is because @ITChazal@it say (Yevamos 62b): “He who is without a wife is without good.” Consequently, he is with evil. (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1[32]@p2<TIE>By accepting to be outcast in both worlds.@p3 You might ask: Rashi said before (43:9) that “I will have sinned to you for all time” meaning in the World to Come. Why does he say here that it means, “In both worlds”? It seems [the answer is:] Here Yehudah is telling [Yoseif] what he said to his father, so it should say @hh<HEB>מעם אבי לאמר אם לא אביאנו אליך וחטאתי @hbלך@hh כל הימים@ee<ENG>. [Why does it say @hh<HEB>וחטאתי @hbלאבי@hh כל הימים@ee<ENG>?] Perforce, @hh<HEB>וחטאתי לאבי@ee<ENG> means in this world, while my father is alive. And [@hh<HEB>כל הימים@ee<ENG> means] also in the world that is completely @hh<HEB>יום@ee<ENG>, i.e., the World to Come. We need not ask: Why did Yehudah, in order to explain himself, find it necessary to say that he was liable of being an outcast in both worlds, [whereas to Yaakov he spoke only of being an outcast of the World to Come]? For the answer is: He thought Yoseif might not believe in the punishment meted out in the World to Come, so he mentioned also the punishment of this world. But Yaakov believed in the punishment meted out in the World to Come. @p1[33]@p2<TIE>I am superior to him for all purposes — in strength.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Question: Strength is used for either war or service, and both are mentioned. So why does Rashi need to say “strength”? The answer is: War and service are the explanation of “strength.” In other words, “For what am I strong? For war and service!” @p1[1]@p2<TIE>He could not bear that the Egyptians standing by him.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 The verse means that Yoseif could not bear his brothers’ humiliation in front of all the people, so he said the people must leave. [Rashi knows this] because otherwise, why did he have them leave? @p1[2]@p2<TIE>Here, the reference is not to a literal house.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Otherwise, it would not be vocalized @hh<HEB>וַיִשְמַע@ee<ENG>, but rather @hh<HEB>וַיִשָמַע@ee<ENG>, [so it would mean, “It was heard in the house of Pharaoh”].@IT @it(@ITMaharshal@it)<QC>
@p1[4]@p2<TIE>And showed them that he was circumcised.@p3 You might ask: How does Rashi know that he said “Come near to me” because he wanted to show them the circumcision? Perhaps he saw them moving back, so he said, “Come near.” The answer is: Rashi infers this because it is written @hh<HEB>גשו אלי@ee<ENG> rather than @hh<HEB>קרבו אלי@ee<ENG>, and @hh<HEB>גשו@ee<ENG> means coming close. Why did they have to come so near to him? Perforce, because he showed them the circumcision. We need not ask: How does Rashi know that he saw them recoiling backwards? Perhaps he said “come close” only to show them the circumcision. For [the answer is:] If so, why did he say, “Please?” It is understandable if he saw them recoiling backwards, and he said “please” in order to speak to them tenderly so they would not feel ashamed. But if they stayed in place, why did he say “please” to them, using an expression of pleading?<QC>
@p1[11]@p2<TIE>From the same root as @HB<HEB>מוריש ומעשיר@BO<ENG>.@p3 But it is not from the root of destruction and expulsion, as in @hh<HEB>אכנו בדבר @hbואורישנו@ee<ENG> (Bamidbar 14:12). That cannot be the meaning, as Yoseif had [enough] to feed all the people during the seven years of famine. @p1[12]@p2<TIE>I have no animosity toward my brother Binyomin.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Question: How does this connect to, “‘That I speak to you’ in the Holy Language”? (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it)<QC>
@p1[14]@p2<TIE>For the two Temples which were destined to be.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [According to @ITRe’m, @itRashi knows that it alludes to @ITtwo@it] because it is written @hh<HEB>צוארֵי@ee<ENG> (plural) rather than @hh<HEB>צואריו@ee<ENG>. And [Rashi knows that it alludes to the @ITTemple@it because] it says in Shir Hashirim (7:5), “Your neck (@hh<HEB>צוארך@ee<ENG>) is like an ivory tower.” Just as there, @hh<HEB>צוארך@ee<ENG> refers to the Temple, so too here, @hh<HEB>צוארי@ee<ENG> refers to the Temple. @p1@p2For the Tabernacle of Shiloh.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 You might ask: Perhaps this phrase follows its plain meaning, [and Binyomin’s crying was not over the Tabernacle’s destruction]? Rashi’s explanation about Yoseif’s crying is understandable because there it is written @hh<HEB>צוארֵי@ee<ENG>, the plural form, rather than @hh<HEB>צואריו@ee<ENG>. But here it is written @hh<HEB>צואריו@ee<ENG>. Perhaps it follows its plain meaning. @ITNachalas Yaakov@it answers: @ITRe’m@it explained at length [citing Midrash Rabbah 92:12. See] there. Also @ITMatnos Kehunah@it [on that Midrash] writes that [@ITChazal@it’s interpretation is because] @hh<HEB>צואריו@ee<ENG> is singular. However, they both overlooked the Gemara in Megillah 16b which also states [as the Midrash Rabbah:] “How many necks did Binyomin have?!” [thus implying that the interpretation is based on the switch between @hh<HEB>צוארֵי@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>צואריו@ee<ENG>]. However, Rashi explains that this line should be deleted from the Gemara’s text because it is normal for Scripture to refer to @hh<HEB>צואר@ee<ENG> in the plural form. Accordingly, @ITRe’m’s@it efforts were in vain [because Rashi states that Scripture’s switching between plural and singular of @hh<HEB>צואר@ee<ENG> is not a basis of expounding the word]. Rather, it seems that the [following] change in wording is the basis for the exposition. Regarding the [other] brothers it is merely written that Yoseif wept upon them. But with Binyomin it mentions @hh<HEB>צואר@ee<ENG> (neck). Therefore @hh<HEB>צואר@ee<ENG> is to be expounded: it hints to the Temple, which is called @hh<HEB>צוארך@ee<ENG>, as mentioned above. The reason that two Temples are mentioned for Binyomin and one for Yoseif is because in fact it was so, not because this was learned from plural and singular forms [of the word @hh<HEB>צואר@ee<ENG>]. @p1[16]@p2<TIE>The same as @HB<HEB>בבית פרעה@BO<ENG> — in Pharaoh’s house, and here it is meant literally.@p3 You might ask: Why is v. 2 different? There, Rashi said that @hh<HEB>וישמע בית פרעה@ee<ENG> does not mean a house literally, but the people of the house. But this is not a question. There, it could not mean a house literally, because it is written @hh<HEB>וַיִשְמַע@ee<ENG>, in the active form, [meaning: “Pharaoh’s house heard.”] This cannot be [understood literally. If it meant there as it does here] it would have said @hh<HEB>וַיִשָמַע@ee<ENG>, in the passive form, conveying that it was heard in Pharaoh’s house, as it is written here: “The news was heard (@hh<HEB>נשמע@ee<ENG>) in Pharaoh’s house.” (@ITR. Meir Stern@it)<QC>
@p1[17]@p2<TIE>With grain.@p3 Accordingly, @hh<HEB>טענו@ee<ENG> is a transitive verb with an auxiliary object. I.e., they should load the beast with grain. [Rashi says this] so we will not think it means they should load the beasts themselves, i.e., that they should feed the beasts. [Rashi knows it does not mean this] because if it did, what difference does it make [that Pharaoh said this? Scripture would have omitted it]. (@ITRe’m@it) @p1[18]@p2<TIE>It would .<TIE>.<TIE>. like the depths of the sea which contains no fish.@p3 Explanation: There are no fish in the water’s depths; rather, they swim above. @p1[19]@p2<TIE>Through me to tell them.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Why is it not written who commanded him this? A further question: Why does is it then written @hh<HEB>זאת עשו@ee<ENG>, in the plural form? It should say @hh<HEB>זאת עשה@ee<ENG>, [in the singular form] since before too it spoke in the singular form: @hh<HEB>ואתה צויתה@ee<ENG>. Therefore Rashi explains: “You are commanded through me, [Pharaoh,] to tell them.”<QC>
@p1[23]@p2<TIE>Aged wine from which old people derive pleasure.@p3 @ITMaharshal@it writes: [Rashi knows this] because it is not written what was the good thing that Yoseif sent him, implying it was not something notable. So why did he send it to him? Because for Yaakov it was good. Therefore Rashi explains it was aged wine which is generally not so notable, but it was noteworthy to Yaakov because old people derive pleasure from it. @p1[24]@p2<TIE>Do not become involved in halachic discussion.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Meaning: halachic discussion requires more delving into, and your attention will thus be diverted from travelling. As a result the road will lead you astray, i.e., you will get lost (Rashi, Taanis 10b). Yoseif warned them only against involvement and delving. But he did not warn them against reciting Torah teachings, since our Rabbis of blessed memory say (ibid): “Two who were walking on the road and there were no words of Torah between them.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1@p2An alternate explanation. Do not take very large steps.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 @ITMaharshal@it writes that Rashi’s first explanation follows one opinion in Taanis 10b, and Rashi’s alternate explanation follows the Baraisa there. Rashi also explains, “And arrive at your evening destination while there is still daylight.” The Baraisa itself offered these two explanations [of “large steps” and “daylight”] because it understands @hh<HEB>תרגזו בדרך@ee<ENG> to mean overly intensive walking, but it did not know whether it means taking large steps or walking a long time, i.e., until nightfall. Thus it offered both explanations: one pertaining to taking large steps, and one pertaining to arriving at their destination while there is still daylight. An overly intense person takes large steps, and the Rabbis taught (ibid), “Large steps remove one-fivehundredth of a person’s eyesight.” @p1[26]@p2<TIE>@BIThat@BO he is ruler.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because @hh<HEB>כי@ee<ENG> can mean @hh<HEB>אם@ee<ENG>, and @hh<HEB>אם@ee<ENG> can mean @hh<HEB>אשר@ee<ENG> (that). (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1@p2His heart was not swayed by their words.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi is answering the question:] Why did Yaakov not believe that Yoseif was alive? He himself had suspected them of selling him! Rashi answers: They said Yoseif was the ruler, and it is implausible that a foreigner would become the ruler, especially in Egypt where a slave may not rule. [Yaakov reasoned:] since this [i.e., that Yoseif is a ruler] is not so, that [i.e., Yoseif is alive] is also not so. Therefore [Rashi says], “His heart was not swayed by their words, [i.e., @ITall @itof their words].” (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1[27]@p2<TIE>He gave them as a sign — the subject that he was studying.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: “They told him all the words of Yoseif” is written after, “For he could not believe them.” This implies that they came to speak to him [after his initial disbelief] and to prove to him that it was true. What proof did they bring? Perforce, “He gave them a sign.<TIE>.<TIE>. the topic of @hh<HEB>עגלה ערופה@ee<ENG>.” I.e., the word @hh<HEB>העגלות@ee<ENG> that is written in the verse should be read as @hh<HEB>הrֶגְלות@ee<ENG> (the heifers). You might ask: How did Yaakov decide to teach him the subject of @hh<HEB>עגלה ערופה@ee<ENG> when they parted? The answer is: When Yoseif left, Yaakov escorted him until the depths of Chevron, as Rashi explained on the verse (37:14), “And he sent Yoseif from the depths of Chevron.” Yoseif said to him, “You should go back.” Yaakov answered, “I am not permitted to go back. A person must escort his fellow [on the way], as it is written in the section of @hh<HEB>עגלה ערופה@ee<ENG> (Devarim 21:7): ‘Our hands have not spilled this blood,’ [which means:] ‘We did not dismiss him without escort,’” as Rashi explains there. Consequently, he taught him the subject of @hh<HEB>עגלה ערופה@ee<ENG>. When the verse says @hb<HEB>וירא@hh את העגלות@ee<ENG>, the word @hh<HEB>וירא@ee<ENG> means “understood.” When they told him about the subject of @hh<HEB>עגלה ערופה@ee<ENG>, he then understood that [what they had said] was true. @p1@p2The Divine Presence, which had left him, rested on him.@p3 I.e., “spirit” refers to prophecy, as it is written (Divrei Hayamim I 12:18): “The spirit (@hh<HEB>רוח@ee<ENG>) clothed Amasai.”<QC>
@p1[1]@p2<TIE>A person must honor his father more than .<TIE>.<TIE>. his grandfather<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Why did it not say, “To the God of his fathers”? Or, “To the God of Avraham,” who was the main one to spread knowledge of Hashem’s Presence? Whereas Yitzchok received [this knowledge] from Avraham.<QC>
@p1[4]@p2<TIE>He promised him that he will be buried in Eretz Yisrael.@p3 Rashi deduces this because it is written, “I will bring you up,” implying to Eretz Yisrael, which is higher than all the other lands. @p1[7]@p2<TIE>Asher’s daughter, Serach and Leivi’s daughter, Yocheved.@p3 You might ask: Why does Scripture write “his daughters” in the plural form? He had only Dinah! We cannot answer that this is in accordance with R. Yehudah who said that a twin sister was born with each of Yaakov’s sons, and the sons married them [i.e., each married another’s twin]. This cannot be, for the twin sisters died before coming to Egypt, as Rashi explains on v. 26. Neither can we answer that it is in accordance with R. Nechemiah who said that the wives of Yaakov’s sons were [born of fathers from other nations and mothers who were] Canaanites, and Scripture calls them Yaakov’s “daughters” because people call their sons-in-law “son” and their daughters-in-law “daughter.” Rashi cited these two conflicting opinions on the verse, “All his sons and @ITall his daughters@it rose to console him” (37:35). Accordingly, [also here] “his daughters” will mean his daughters-in-law. But this cannot be, for Scripture is counting Yaakov’s own offspring here [as it says in v. 26]. It seems the answer is: When Scripture treats the genealogy of many people, it speaks in plural even for one person. [Examples are:] “The @ITsons@it of Don were Chushim” (v. 23), and, “The @ITsons@it of Palu were Eliav” (Bamidbar 26:8). Although [it might infer that] “his daughters” means Dinah alone, we still would prefer to include [other descendants] where possible, rather than relying on stretched explanations. Thus Rashi explains [“his granddaughters” as] Serach and Yocheved, [even though Yocheved is not expressly mentioned in this section]. And so it seems from Bava Basra 143b. We need not ask then on the contrary: [If this is true, then] on the verse, “They rose to console him” (37:35), why did R. Yehudah say they were twins, and R. Nechemiah say they were daughters-in-law? Perhaps it was only Dinah! For [the answer is:] It is different there, because it is written, “@ITAll @ithis daughters.” Alternatively, it is different in this case, because here it is treating the genealogy of many people, as mentioned above. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1[8]@p2<TIE>Concerning that particular time Scripture refers to them as “those who are coming”.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Moshe Rabbeinu wrote the Torah for us, and in his days they had already come. If so, it should say, “Who came”! Thus Rashi explains [as he does].<QC>
@p1[10]@p2<TIE>The son of Deenah who was violated by a Canaanite.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: According to the view that the wives [of Yaakov’s sons] were Canaanites [see entry on v. 7], all of their children should have been called children of Canaanite women. Why is Shaul singled out? And according to the view that a twin sister was born with each son, and they married them [see entry on v. 7], why mention “A Canaanite woman,” at all? Rashi’s answer addresses both views.<QC>
@p1[26]@p2<TIE>We must assume that they died.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Because otherwise, why were they not counted among the other children? Thus it says, “Not counting the wives [of Yaakov’s sons],” to convey that they had died, and these wives [mentioned here] were of foreign origin and did not come out of Yaakov’s loins. Scripture itself explains this. (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1@p2Eisov had six souls.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 As it is written in 36:6: “Eisov took his wives.<TIE>.<TIE>. and all the @ITsouls@it of his household.” There must be an error in the text of Rashi, because Eisov had only five souls, yet Rashi, who cites the Midrash that says six. This requires further investigation. @p1[28]@p2<TIE>To prepare a house of study.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., since it is written @hb<HEB>ל@hhהורת@ee<ENG> without a second @ITvav, @itit contains the letters [of the word] @hh<HEB>תורה@ee<ENG>.<QC>
@p1[29]@p2<TIE>He himself harnessed the horses to the chariot.@p3 Otherwise, it should say: “He rode in his chariot.” @p1@p2Yoseif appeared to his father.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because we cannot say Yaakov appeared to Yoseif, since Yaakov did not go to appear to Yoseif. Rather, [Yaakov went] to see him and to live in Egypt. But Yoseif went toward his father to appear before him. (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1@p2He does not place upon him accusations which are in excess of his sins.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is explaining the verse he cited: @hh<HEB>כי לא על איש ישים עוד@ee<ENG>. I.e., when Hashem punishes the wicked, He does not punish them more than they sinned. “He does not place upon him [accusations which are in excess of his sins].” @p1@p2Our Sages explained that this was because he was reading the “Shema.”@p3 Some ask: Perhaps he was standing in prayer? It seems [the answer is:] Our Rabbis of blessed memory said in Berachos 27a that we may not pass in front of someone standing in prayer, so as not to interfere with his concentration. Surely, Yoseif would not fall on Yaakov’s neck lest he disturb his concentration. But with the Shema, we need to concentrate mainly in the first verse, which where we accept upon ourselves the Kingship of Heaven. And Yoseif fell on Yaakov’s neck after Yaakov had read the first verse. You might ask: Why was Yoseif, too, not reading the Shema? The answer is: Yoseif was involved with the mitzvah of honoring his father. Someone involved in the performance of a mitzvah is exempt from performing another mitzvah. Another answer: Yoseif exempted himself by reading the first verse [alone], since he was busy and occupied, as it says in the Gemara in Berachos 13b that [the single verse of] Shema Yisrael was the Shema of R. Yehudah Hanasi, because he was busy with teaching the disciples. @p1[30]@p2<TIE>The plain meaning is as Onkelos explains it.@p3 I.e., the verse does not mean what it sounds like, that Yaakov wished to die now that he merited seeing Yoseif’s face. On the contrary, after having merited to see him, Yaakov should pray to live and enjoy being with his son [to make up for] the days of their suffering. @p1[31]@p2<TIE>And I will also tell him: “The men are shepherds, etc.”@p3 Rashi means: we should not think that “The men are shepherds etc.” is a new statement, and Yoseif said it to his brothers, not to Pharaoh. If so, “the men” would refer to different men, [not his brothers]. Thus Rashi explains: And I will also tell Pharaoh this matter, that “the men are shepherds etc.” @p1[34]@p2<TIE>Because they are deities to them.@p3 The Egyptians know that shepherds know all about sheep, since they are always with them. Shepherds therefore know that sheep have nothing [divine about them], so the Egyptians hate all shepherds. Alternatively, when Scripture says @hh<HEB>כי @hbתועבת@hh מצרים כל רעי צאן@ee<ENG>, the word @hh<HEB>תועבה@ee<ENG> means idolatry. In other words, the Egyptians greatly respected shepherds and considered them as if they were deities. Therefore, Pharaoh will settle them in the best of the land. @p1[2]@p2<TIE>But there is a reason for this.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Which is: the entire forty years the Israelites were in the wilderness, Yehudah’s bones rattled in his coffin, [and Moshe prayed for him]. Rashi cites this on Devarim 33:7.<QC>
@p1[6]@p2<TIE>Experts in their occupation of tending sheep.@p3 Rashi is saying that here, @hh<HEB>חיל@ee<ENG> does not mean piety or wealth. @p1@p2Over my sheep.@p3 It is written (v. 3) @hh<HEB>רועי @hbצאן@hh עבדיך@ee<ENG>. Since they said to Pharaoh they were @hh<HEB>רועי @hbצאן@ee<ENG> only, [thus Rashi knows that] the word @hh<HEB>מקנה@ee<ENG> in this verse refers to @hh<HEB>צאן@ee<ENG> (sheep).<QC>
@p1[10]@p2<TIE>What blessing did he give him? That the Nile rise as he approached it.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 This explanation is from Midrash Tanchuma, as Rashi mentions at the end [i.e., older versions of Rashi mentioned Tanchuma as the source]. Accordingly, “Yaakov blessed” means he gave him an actual blessing. But according to the first explanation, it was not an actual blessing. It rather meant: “Those who take leave of royalty, bless them [as a matter of formality]and take their leave.” Therefore, Rashi is asking [according to the Midrash: “What blessing did he give him?” Alternatively, even according to the first explanation that maintains that those who take leave of royalty offer a blessing, but that too is an actual blessing, regarding this [Rashi asks:] “What blessing did he give him?”<QC>
@p1[12]@p2<TIE>According to the needs of all the members of the household.@p3 Meaning: children scatter bread unnecessarily, and it says that Yoseif provided even for the needs of the children, i.e., he provided more than they really needed. [Thus Rashi knows that] he surely provided for the needs of the members of the household. @p1[13]@p2<TIE>Returns to the beginning of the account.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., to the first year. [Rashi knows this] because the famine ceased when Yaakov came to Egypt, as Rashi soon explains [see v. 19]. Perforce, our verse goes back to before Yaakov came to Egypt. @p1@p2Similar to this is: @HB<HEB>כמתלהלה@BO<ENG> who shoots firebrands. @boI.e., the @hh<HEB>ה@ee<ENG> of @hh<HEB>כמתל@hbה@hhלה@ee<ENG> is in place of @hh<HEB>א@ee<ENG>, as the letters @hh<HEB>א–ה–ו–י@ee<ENG> are interchangeable. @p1[14]@p2<TIE>They gave him the money.@p3 Rashi is saying that we should not think @hh<HEB>שבר@ee<ENG> means selling, because if it did, the verse should have written @hh<HEB>בשבר אשר @hbהוא@hh שובר@ee<ENG>, referring to Yoseif, who sold to them. Since it is written @hh<HEB>בשבר אשר @hbהם@hh שוברים@ee<ENG>, it refers to the people who purchased from Yoseif.<QC>
@p1[18]@p2<TIE>That the money and livestock are used up.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi writes @hh<HEB>אשר@ee<ENG> in place of [Scripture’s word] @hh<HEB>אם@ee<ENG>. This is because @hh<HEB>אם@ee<ENG> [generally] conveys “if,” but here it does not mean that. Rashi adds, “And everything has come into my master’s hand,” because the verse seemingly says that the money was used up by Yoseif. [But now] it conveys: “We did not spend any of our money on anything else; all has come into our master’s hand.” @p1@p2The same as: if not for our bodies.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because @hh<HEB>בלתי@ee<ENG> cannot mean “except for” and it cannot mean “not,” because then the word @hh<HEB>אם@ee<ENG> (“if”) will not fit in. [I.e., it would read as: “except for if our bodies,” or: “not if our bodies.”] Thus Rashi explains that @hh<HEB>בלתי@ee<ENG> indeed means “not.” However, the verse’s wording must be inverted: @hh<HEB>אם לא גויתינו@ee<ENG>, i.e., @hh<HEB>אם בלתי גויתינו@ee<ENG>. Accordingly, it means: “except for our bodies.” @p1[19]@p2<TIE>To sow in the ground.@p3 [Rashi knows it means this] because otherwise it should say, “Give us bread,” or, “Give us foodstuff.”<QC>
@p1@p2They began to sow and the famine ended.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 You might ask: If so, would people not say that Yoseif is a fraud? For he had interpreted [Pharaoh’s dream] that there would be a seven-year famine! The answer is: The famine ended only in Egypt, not in other lands. And when they observed the Nile rising to meet Pharaoh they knew it was on account of Yaakov’s blessing. @p1[20]@p2<TIE>Bought for him.@p3 Rashi is explaining that it does not mean under his rulership, as that was so even beforehand. 21@p1@p2 Yoseif transferred them from city to city.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi says this] so we will not think that it was Pharaoh who is mentioned just before, [who did this. That is not so,] because Yoseif was the buyer, the one who transferred them, and the giver of seed. @p1@p2He did this to all the cities that were in the kingdom of Egypt.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi says this so we will not think that Yoseif only switched [people] from one end to another end, but he did not switch [people living] in the middle of the country. Therefore he says, “@ITAll@it the cities.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1[22]@p2<TIE>Whenever the word @HB<HEB>כהן@BO<ENG> is used it refers to a servant of a deity.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Wherever it says @hh<HEB>כהן@ee<ENG> alone, without explaining the association to what he is a @hh<HEB>כהן@ee<ENG>, it assumedly means he is the servant of a deity. This is surely so when it states @hh<HEB>כהן@ee<ENG> to Hashem, or @hh<HEB>כהן@ee<ENG> to an idol. But with @hh<HEB>כהן מדין@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>כהן און@ee<ENG>, where it mentions the name of the country or city, it means he is their governor or leader. That is why Onkelos translates it here as @hh<HEB>כומריא@ee<ENG> (priests), but translates @hh<HEB>כהן און@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>כהן מדין@ee<ENG> as @hh<HEB>רבא דאון@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>רבא דמדין@ee<ENG>.

@p1[24]@p2<TIE>For each year.@p3 I.e., not the first year alone. @ITRe’m@it asks: Why did Rashi not make this comment at the beginning of the verse, “When it produces”? then it would apply to everything written afterward. The answer is: Here, [Rashi’s comment] is proven true. For Yoseif already said, “Here is seed, plant the soil.” Why does it say here, “For seed for your fields”? Perforce, because the statute of giving a fifth to Pharaoh applied for each year, thus he ordered them here to sow [each year] so that the fifth not become lessened. But if the statute was only for the first year, why was Yoseif concerned whether they sow [each year] or not? Perforce, it must have been for each year.

Pharaoh requested them to [voluntarily] serve him, as it says in Sotah 11b that @hh<HEB>בפרך@ee<ENG> (Shemos 1:13) means @hh<HEB>בפה רך@ee<ENG>, “with a soft mouth.” In the beginning, the Egyptians enslaved them with a soft mouth. @p1@p2An alternate explanation: Because he wished to reveal the End.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 You might ask: According to the first explanation, it should be “closed” [not here but] in the verse where it is written that Yaakov died (49:33). And according to the alternate explanation, it should be “closed” in the verse, “Gather around and I will tell you.<TIE>.<TIE>. the end of days” (49:1). The answer is: In the middle of the @ITparshah @itit would not be noticeable that it is “closed,” since it is usually “closed” there, so we would not know [that we should make] these expositions. And here Scripture enumerates Yaakov’s years, so it is considered the place where he died. And [this as well answers the explanation of] “reveal the End”: Yaakov assumedly would not reveal the End until close to his death, and here is the place of his death, as Rashi explains. Therefore, [the basis for Rashi’s interpretations] is evident. @ITMaharshal@it writes that there is a question on the first explanation: This @ITparshah@it does not mention the bondage. Why then was Parshas@IT @itShemos not “closed”? Therefore Rashi brings the alternate explanation. And there is a question on the alternate explanation: Why is it not “closed” at the section of (49:1), “Yaakov called for his sons.<TIE>.<TIE>. gather around and I will tell you.<TIE>.<TIE>.”? Therefore Rashi brings also the first explanation. @p1[29]@p2<TIE>Everyone of whom it is said that his “days drew near”.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the questions: Why does it say “days” in the plural form, [rather than saying, “The day of Yisrael’s death drew near”]? And why does it speak of the days, implying that the days drew near? It should say, “Yisrael drew near to die.” Thus Rashi explains that the days themselves indeed “drew near.” They shortened and drew near [rather than expanding to the age of his fathers]. @p1@p2@BIAnd@BO take an oath.@p3 Rashi is explaining that we should not think the placing of the hand is the oath itself. He knows this because it is written regarding Avraham (24:2): “Place your hand under my thigh,” after which it says, “I will have you swear by Adonoy.” Since Avraham did it this way, [to place the hand under the thigh while swearing,] so did Yaakov. (@ITRe’m@it)<QC>
@p1@p2Is considered true kindness for one does not anticipate.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi does not mean that it is true kindness only when it is done with the dead. Rather, whenever kindness is done without the anticipation of remuneration, even if the recipient of the kindness is alive, it is considered “kind and truthful.” For Eliezer said that Lavan and Besuel should [“do kindly and truthfully” (49:22) and] give him Rivkah freely, anticipating no remuneration — not from him, as he promised them no gifts of silver and gold, and certainly not from Avraham, since he was far away. You might ask: Why did Rashi not explain before, regarding Eliezer, that this is considered true kindness? The answer is: Yaakov in fact remunerated Yoseif for swearing to take him to Eretz Yisrael. He said (48:22), “I have given you one share more,” as Rashi explains ad loc. That is why Rashi explains the point here [and not regarding Eliezer]. It is to say that even so, at the time Yaakov asked Yoseif to bury him in Eretz Yisrael, he neither promised to give him anything, nor did he have in mind to give him one share more. And that is why it says here, “kindly and truthfully.” @p1@p2By suffering the pain of rolling through underground tunnels. Also, so that the Egyptians not make a deity of me.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi needed these three explanations because: If it was only on account of lice, Yaakov should have requested that they make an iron coffin. Therefore Rashi explained, “rolling through underground tunnels.” And if because of these two reasons alone, why did Yaakov trouble Yoseif that he be brought to Eretz Yisrael immediately? He could have told them to take his bones along when they leave Egypt, as Yoseif said [to do for himself] in 50:25. Thus Rashi gives the [third] reason, “That the Egyptians not make a deity of me.” And there is a question: If the only reason is that the Egyptians might “make a deity of me,” why did he say to take him to Eretz Yisrael, rather than to cast him in the Nile? Thus Rashi also offers the reason of “rolling through underground tunnels.” And if it was for these two reasons alone, he should have had them swear just as Yoseif told his brothers to swear, [that they will take him along when they leave Egypt]. Thus Rashi also offers the reason of “its soil will become lice.” (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1[30]@p2<TIE>This letter @HB<HEB>ו@BO<ENG> connects this with the beginning of the previous verse.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi explains right afterward that @hh<HEB>ושכבתי@ee<ENG> means dying. Accordingly, Yaakov should first have said he will die, and then say, “Please do not bury me in Egypt.” Thus Rashi explains, “This letter @hh<HEB>ו@ee<ENG> connects .<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1@p2Put me to rest with my fathers in the cave.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 According to which it would mean actual burial. Rashi explains @hh<HEB>ושכבתי@ee<ENG> to mean @hh<HEB>השכיבני@ee<ENG> because @hh<HEB>ושכבתי@ee<ENG> implies putting oneself down to rest, whereas burial is done by others. Thus he also adds “in the cave,” since [in this explanation] @hh<HEB>ושכבתי עם אבותי@ee<ENG> means actual burial. Accordingly, the verse means: “Put me to rest [i.e., bury me] with my fathers in the cave.” @p1@p2Carry me from Egypt and bury me in their grave.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is saying that there are two contradictions. 1.<TIE>It should It should have written first, “Carry me out of Egypt,” and then, “I will lie,” since he must first be carried and only then buried. 2.<TIE>“I will lie” is apparently repetitive because it is written afterward, “Bury me in their grave.”<QC>
@p1@p2“And Dovid lay with his fathers” and afterwards: “And he was buried.<TIE>.<TIE>.”@p3 Perforce, the @hh<HEB>וישכב@ee<ENG> of Dovid means death. For if it meant burial, it would indicate that they buried him with his fathers, i.e., in Beis Lechem where Dovid’s fathers lived. But then it is written, “He was buried in the City of Dovid,” implying Tzion, which is the City of Dovid. Thus it must be that @hh<HEB>שכיבה@ee<ENG> means death. @p1[31]@p2<TIE>When it is the time of the fox, bow to him.@p3 I found it written that for one month in the year the fox is king of the animals. About that month it was said, “When it is the time of the fox.” (@ITKitzur Mizrachi@it) @p1@p2He turned toward the Divine Presence.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 You might ask: Did not Rashi just say, “When it is the time of the fox, bow to him,” implying that he bowed to Yoseif? The answer is: If he bowed only for Yoseif, why was it specifically, “At the head of the bed”? And if he bowed only for the @ITShechinah@it, Scripture should have written, “Yisrael prostrated himself to Hashem,” or, “.<TIE>.<TIE>.to Elokim.” Perforce, he bowed on account of both of them, the Divine Presence @ITand@it Yoseif.<QC>
@p1@p2It is from here that they derived that the @BIShechinah@BO is above the headrest of a sick person.<TIE>.<TIE>. @boAlthough Yaakov was not sick [then], he had weakened and was as if sick. Otherwise, why did he request [regarding] his burial place? @p1@p2For his bed was perfect and none of the offspring was wicked.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 We cannot say that [the bowing was] only to the @ITShechinah@it, because then it should say, “@ITTo@it the head of the bed.” Perforce, he bowed also to Yoseif. But it is a forced explanation of the verse to say that he bowed to Yoseif, yet turned toward the Divine Presence. Therefore Rashi brings “another interpretation.<TIE>.<TIE>. for his bed was perfect.<TIE>.<TIE>.” But this cannot be the only explanation, because if so, why does it say, “At the head of”? [It should just say, “At the bed].” Therefore, Rashi brings the first explanations [as well]. (@ITMaharshal@it) @p11@p2<TIE>One of the tellers.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi says, “One of the tellers,” to convey that] “said to Yoseif” in fact means “told Yoseif,” for news is “told,” not “said.” Yaakov’s falling sick before he died was something new to the world, since before his time there was no weakness [before death]. And why is it not written, “told Yoseif”? Because the teller was Ephraim, who was frequently with Yaakov so he saw that he was sick, and it was nothing new to him. @p1@p2Ephraim was frequently with Yaakov for study.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 We need not ask: How does Rashi know that Ephraim was frequently [with him for study]? For the answer is: It is written (v. 14), “Yisrael stretched out his right hand.<TIE>.<TIE>. he deliberately placed his hands so (@hh<HEB>שכל את ידיו@ee<ENG>).” And why does it not say he “switched his hands” (@hh<HEB>הפך את ידיו@ee<ENG>)? Because Yaakov was hinting to him that Ephraim was expert in Torah and had greater understanding (@hh<HEB>שכל@ee<ENG>) than Menasheh, and for this reason Yaakov deliberately placed (@hh<HEB>שכל@ee<ENG>) his hands. And how did Yaakov know this [about Ephraim]? Because Ephraim was frequently with Yaakov for study.<QC>
@p1@p2So that Yaakov might bless them.@p3 Otherwise, why should it be mentioned? @p1@p2Before his death.@p3 Yoseif knew that Yaakov had weakened, and now they told him that he was sick. Yoseif said to himself: surely, the day of his death has come. Thus he took his sons with him. @p1[2]@p2<TIE>There are numerous such elliptical verses.@p3 Rashi does not explain here that the teller was Ephraim, as he explained above, since “he took his two sons with him” implies that Ephraim was with Yoseif and went with him to Yaakov. @p1@p2From here that we must honor royalty.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because Yoseif needed Yaakov [to bless his sons], yet Yaakov bowed to him nevertheless. But before (47:31), Rashi explained [the bowing differently:] “When it is the time of the fox, bow to him.” This is because Yaakov needed Yoseif [to swear to bury him]. @p1@p2And your servants will come down to me.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Moshe knew that even Pharaoh would come down, as in fact happened. He said “your servants” [instead of “you”] to honor royalty. @p1@p2That one of my tribes is destined to be divided.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., the division into two is considered as two extra sons. @p1[5]@p2<TIE>@HB<HEB>לפני@BO<ENG> — @BIbefore@BO I came to you.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo [Rashi explains this] because @hh<HEB>עד בואי@ee<ENG> seemingly implies they were born after Yaakov came to him. But in 41:50 it is written, “Two sons were born to Yoseif before the years of famine came.” And when Yaakov came to Yoseif, two famine years had already passed. Thus Rashi explains, “@ITBefore@it I came.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1[6]@p2<TIE>If you will have any more children they will not be counted.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Since @hh<HEB>אשר@ee<ENG> seems to imply that he surely will have children, Rashi explains: “@ITIf @ityou will have any more children.” This is because @hh<HEB>אשר@ee<ENG> can mean @hh<HEB>אם@ee<ENG> (if). Since we find that @hh<HEB>אם@ee<ENG> can mean @hh<HEB>אשר@ee<ENG>, as Rashi explained on 24:19, therefore @hh<HEB>אשר@ee<ENG> can mean @hh<HEB>אם@ee<ENG>. @p1@p2Nevertheless, the only ones to be called Tribes are these.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Each tribe’s inheritance was called by its own name: Reuven’s inheritance, Shimon’s inheritance, etc. Similarly, the inheritance of Menasheh and Ephraim will be called by their name: Menasheh’s inheritance and Ephraim’s inheritance, each with his own territory, like the other tribes. It will not be called Yoseif’s inheritance. And when Rashi said above: “They [the future children of Yoseif] will not have their own names as tribes,” it means that their inheritance will not be called by their name.<QC>
@p1[7]@p2<TIE>When the earth is riddled with holes like a sieve.@p3 Rashi explained @hh<HEB>כברת@ee<ENG> as a measure. Nevertheless, since Scripture chose to use the word @hh<HEB>כברת@ee<ENG>, both [explanations] are implied. @p1@p2Even to Beis Lechem in order to bring her to a [settled] land.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 You might ask: Does the verse not state clearly that she was buried in Eretz Yisrael? For it is written, “Rochel died unto me in the land of Canaan,” and Canaan is Eretz Yisrael. [If so, why does Rashi say that Yaakov did not bring her @hh<HEB>לארץ@ee<ENG>?] The answer is: Surely she was buried in Eretz Yisrael, but @hh<HEB>לארץ@ee<ENG> means “to an inhabited town,” as in @hh<HEB>ארץ נושבת@ee<ENG> (Shemos 16:35). @p1@p2I buried her there so that she may help her descendants.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 You might ask: Did Rashi not previously explain (30:15) that “because she made light of being with the tzaddik, she did not merit being buried with him”? The answer is: Although this caused her to not be buried with him in Me’aras Hamachpelah, the question remains: why did she not merit burial in a town, rather than in a field? Perforce, “So she might help her descendants.<TIE>.<TIE>.” But we cannot say that “help her descendants” was the sole reason, and not “she made light.” For if so, why was Rochel — out of all the matriarchs — not buried with Yaakov? Surely, it was also because “she made light.” Question: Why did Yaakov tell Yoseif only now that her burial on the road was according to the word of Hashem? [The answer is:] Yaakov did not want to reveal to him the future troubles [of Israel’s exile] until necessary. For if not now, when? @p1@p2As is mentioned: “He plows repeatedly.”@p3 This means to plow and then repeat it. @p1[8]@p2<TIE>He attempted to bless them, but the Divine Presence departed from him.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Why is it written ‘Who are these?” Did Yaakov not recognize that they were Menasheh and Ephraim? Alternatively, Rashi is answering the question: [How can it say,] “Yisrael saw”? It is written right afterward (v. 10), “Yisrael’s eyes were heavy .<TIE>.<TIE>. he could not see.” Thus Rashi explains, “He attempted to bless them but the Divine Presence departed from him.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Accordingly, “Yaakov saw” means he saw through @ITruach hakodesh,@it as [Rashi explained on], “Yaakov saw that food was being sold in Egypt” (42:1). @p1[9]@p2<TIE>He showed him his betrothal and marriage contracts.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Question: Why did Yoseif show him the betrothal contract, and then pray? Why not the other way around? The answer is: At first he thought Yaakov did not want to bless them because they were born out of wedlock and were illegitimate children. So he showed him the contract, [proving] they were legitimate children. When he saw that Yaakov still did not bless them, he figured that surely @ITruach hakodesh @itmust have left him, and he prayed for compassion. (@ITMaharshal@it)<QC>
@p1[11]@p2<TIE>I did not dare have any thought.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Yaakov thought that “Yoseif has been torn to pieces” (37:33). If so, why would he think he would see him? Thus Rashi explains, “I did not dare have any thought.” In other words, it never occurred to me to think differently, that perhaps you were not torn up and I will see you alive. @p1[12]@p2<TIE>When he stepped back from his father.@p3 It seems to me that Rashi here may be understood according to what he explained on 42:6, that “Every @hh<HEB>השתחואה@ee<ENG> implies the stretching out of the hands and feet.” Accordingly, while Yoseif was still standing before his father he could not stretch himself out. Perforce, it was “when he stepped back.” (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it)<QC>
@p1[14]@p2<TIE>For he well knew that Menasheh was the firstborn and, nevertheless.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: The word @hh<HEB>כי@ee<ENG> in Scripture usually comes to explain what preceded. But according to Onkelos, who explains @hh<HEB>שִׂכֵל@ee<ENG> as “wisdom,” how does [“Menasheh was the firstborn”] explain [what preceded]? Thus Rashi explains [that here, @hh<HEB>כי@ee<ENG> does not explain what preceded. It rather means:] “And, nevertheless.” In other words, [@hh<HEB>כי@ee<ENG> means:] @ITeven though@it he knew that Menasheh was the firstborn. And this was the wisdom, as it says, “I know my son, I know” (v. 19). @ITMaharshal@it writes: Many explain that [according to Rashi, this] @hh<HEB>כי@ee<ENG> means “even though.” But it seems not so. Rather, this is how the verse flows. It says, “He deliberately placed his hands,” and then explains why he did this instead of telling Yoseif to rearrange them with Ephraim to his right and Menasheh to his left. [The explanation is:] “Because Menasheh was the firstborn.” In other words, since Menasheh was the firstborn he did not want to embarrass him.<QC>
@p1[16]@p2<TIE>The angel who was usually sent to me in my time of affliction.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because an angel is unable to redeem anyone without Hashem’s permission. @p1@p2Menasheh and Ephraim.@p3 If Rashi did not specifically explain this, we would think that it cannot mean Ephraim and Menasheh. Since it is specifically written in v. 20 that Yaakov blessed them, why then would he bless them again? Thus we would have thought that “the lads” were Yoseif’s young sons. Therefore Rashi explains that it refers to Menasheh and Ephraim. [Rashi knows this] because Yoseif did not have other sons. And why did he bless them twice? The answer is: Here it is written, “He blessed Yoseif,” and he included them in Yoseif’s blessing but did not bless them on their own. In v. 20 he gave them their own blessing. But to me it seems [that Rashi knew it means Menasheh and Ephraim] because it is written @IT“the @itlads,” meaning those mentioned above, and only Menasheh and Ephraim were mentioned. Furthermore, Yoseif is not known to have had any other sons. The proof is that on v. 6, Rashi explained @hh<HEB>אשר הולדת@ee<ENG> to mean, “@ITIf@it you will have any more sons.” (@ITKitzur Mizrachi@it) @p1[17]@p2<TIE>He lifted it from his son’s head.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi needed to explain this because @hh<HEB>הרמה@ee<ENG> means removing, but @hh<HEB>ויתמוך@ee<ENG> means supporting, [and they are opposites]. @p1[19]@p2<TIE>That he is the firstborn.@p3 Rashi needed to explain this so we will not think it means, “I know that he too will become a people.” I.e., that Yoseif knew Menasheh will become a people but he thought Yaakov did not know — and Yaakov said he also knows Menasheh will be great and will become a people. And [Rashi knows it does not mean this because] the verse does not say so. Yoseif said only, “For this one is the firstborn.” Thus Rashi explains: “I know,” as you do, “that he is the firstborn.” And I also know something you do not: “He too will become a people; he too will become great.” @p1@p2The whole world will be filled when his reputation and name will spread.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: “His descendants will fill the nations” — does this not imply his descendants will be scattered throughout the world? And this is not [greatness] but a curse! Thus Rashi explains, “His reputation.” The verse is as if saying, “The @ITname@it of his descendants will be throughout the world,” by means of [making] the moon and sun [stand still] which is seen throughout the world. @p1[20]@p2<TIE>He will bless them with their blessing and a person will say to his son.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Since the term “Yisroel” means the people of Yisroel, which is a plural noun, why does it say @hh<HEB>ישימך@ee<ENG>, in the singular form? Thus Rashi adds, “And a person will say to his son.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1@p2Insofar as his blessing was concerned. Ahead of Menasheh.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi is explaining] that this was not a literal placing; Yaakov did not take Ephraim and put him in front of Menasheh. Rather, it was a placing [in order] of importance, that Ephraim comes first for the banners, etc. @p1[22]@p2<TIE>Because you will take the trouble to occupy yourself with my burial.@p3 Rashi said, “Because you will take the trouble.<TIE>.<TIE>.” because [otherwise the reason for giving him Shechem] has no connection with the preceding. @p1@p2Therefore, I have also given you an inheritance.@p3 Explanation: I have already given it to you. This is because in the blessings that Yaakov gave them afterward, they were all equal [in inheriting the Land]. Accordingly, Yaakov said to him: I have hereby given it to you, and it will not be included in those blessings. (@ITMaharshal@it)<QC>
@p1@p2This shall be for you one share in excess.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: If Shechem means the actual @hh<HEB>עיר@ee<ENG> (city) of Shechem, [and @hh<HEB>עיר@ee<ENG> is a feminine noun,] why is it written @hh<HEB>אחד@ee<ENG> which is the masculine form? Perforce, @hh<HEB>אחד@ee<ENG> does not refer to the city. Rather, the verse is saying that the city of Shechem shall be for you @hh<HEB>אחד חלק@ee<ENG> (one share), and @hh<HEB>אחד@ee<ENG> refers to @hh<HEB>חלק@ee<ENG>, which is masculine. (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1@p2You will scatter my enemies before me.@p3 I.e., this is an explanation of the verse, “You will make them as portions.” @p1@p2Who acted as if he were an Emorite.@p3 There is a question on this explanation: why should Eisov be compared specifically to an Emorite? Thus Rashi brings another explanation. And according to the second explanation: It should have said @hh<HEB>אמרי@ee<ENG> instead of @hh<HEB>אמורי@ee<ENG>! That is why Rashi brings both explanations. (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1@p2His wisdom and prayers.@p3 I.e., “with my sword” is wisdom. Just as a sword saves the one who has it, so too, wisdom saves the one who possesses it. This is as it says (Koheles 7:11), “Wisdom gives life to the one who has it.” “My bow” (@hh<HEB>ובקשתי@ee<ENG>) is an expression of pleading (@hh<HEB>בקשה@ee<ENG>) and prayer. @p1@p2He wished to reveal the End.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [How does Rashi know this? The answer is:] Since Scripture uses two expressions, “gather around” and “come together,” it hints to the End. For it is written (Yeshayah 66:12), “He will gather the scattered ones of Yehudah.” And it is written (Tzephaniah 3:19), “He will gather the lost one,” which hints to the last exile. Anoher answer: Since it is written, “In latter days,” which is superfluous, [perforce] it hints to the End of Days which will be in latter days. @p1[3]@p2<TIE>He had never had a nocturnal emission.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because @hh<HEB>אוני@ee<ENG> is redundant, for it is already written @hh<HEB>כחי@ee<ENG>, and @hh<HEB>אוני@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>כחי@ee<ENG> have the same meaning as Rashi explains. [Question:] A woman cannot conceive from her first act of relations. [So how could Reuvein the son of Leah, have been conceived from Yaakov’s first drop? The answer is:] Perhaps Leah had been deflowered by a piece of wood. @ITRe’m@it answers: She had deflowered herself with her finger. There are other answers; see there. @ITNachalas Yaakov@it writes: If not for what they wrote, I would explain that Leah did not actually conceive from the first drop. Rather, all of Yaakov’s drops were for [the purpose of conceiving] Reuvein, as Yaakov never had a nocturnal emission due to improper thoughts. See what he says there. @p1[4]@p2<TIE>The Name.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because “profaned” refers to Hashem. “To profane” can be said regarding Hashem, as in the expression @hh<HEB>חילול השם@ee<ENG>. But “To profane” cannot be said about a bed, and he who explains it so is mistaken. @p1[5]@p2<TIE>Their hatred was not so complete.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi did not give the reason of “They would not have spoken before their older brothers” because Yoseif had told Yaakov that [the older brothers] were calling the handmaids’ sons “slaves.” Thus Yoseif slandered the handmaids’ sons, and they would have had a justification [to speak before their older brothers,] since Yoseif called them “slaves.” Thus Rashi gives a stronger reason, [that their hatred was not so complete]. (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1@p2Yissachar and Zevulun would not have spoken before their older brothers.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 You might ask: How did Shimon and Leivi speak before Reuvein? @ITMaharshal@it answers: Reuvein was not there at the time, as he had gone to attend to his father [see Rashi, 37:29]. @p1@p2Another explanation of @HB<HEB>מכרותיהם@BO<ENG>: in the land of their sojournings (@HB<HEB>מגורתם@BO<ENG>).<TIE>.<TIE>. @bo[Rashi knows this] because the @hh<HEB>כ@ee<ENG> of @hh<HEB>מ@hbכ@hhרותיהם@ee<ENG> is interchangeable with a @hh<HEB>ג@ee<ENG>, since they are among the group of letters of @hh<HEB>ג–י–כ–ק@ee<ENG> [that are interchangeable]. @p1[6]@p2<TIE>Who permitted you to marry Yisro’s daughter?@p3 You might ask: Why was Moshe in fact permitted to marry a Midianite woman? The answer is: Tzipporah was a proselyte. Another answer: Moshe married her before the Torah was given.<QC>
@p1@p2When the lineage of Korach is recorded concerning the “platform,” it is said.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 It seems Rashi cites this so we will not ask: How does Rashi know that the verse means this? Perhaps the Torah omitted Yaakov from the episodes of Zimri and Korach because it is Scripture’s way to trace lineage back to the Twelve Tribes, but not further. Therefore Rashi cites this verse where the lineage is traced back to Yaakov. If so, why in [Parshas] Korach did the lineage go back only to Leivi? The verses seem to conflict. Perforce, it is because Yaakov had requested that he not be mentioned in the lineage there. This seems to be an answer to @ITRe’m, @itwho asked the question: why is Yaakov’s name mentioned in Divrei Hayamim contrary to the manner in which it is mentioned in Scripture? @ITRe’m@it also asks: Nowhere is Yaakov’s name mentioned in Scripture in connection with Zimri. If so, why did we not say that Scripture fails to say @hh<HEB>זמרי בן סלוא נשיא בית אב לשמעוני @hbבן יעקב@ee<ENG> simply because heads of families are traced back to the Twelve Tribes, not further? It seems the answer is: We see that the reason @ITKorach’s@it lineage is not traced back to Yaakov is due to Yaakov’s prayer, as I wrote, for otherwise the verses would conflict. If so, with Zimri too it was due to Yaakov’s prayer. For the verse mentions the two together: “My soul will not enter their secret council (Zimri), [let my honor not be identified with their assembly (Korach)].” @p1@p2The word @HB<HEB>כבוד@BO<ENG> is masculine.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi is saying] that the conjugation for the masculine second person is the same as for the feminine third person, as it is here. Therefore @hh<HEB>תחד@ee<ENG> could be either feminine third person or masculine second person.<QC>
@p1@p2They wished to exterminate Yoseif.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi is explaining: The verse does] not mean they actually exterminated him, for Yoseif ruled. Rather, they are so called because their intent was to exterminate him, as in (Devarim 26:5): “The Aramaean who destroyed my forefather,” [referring to Lavan who sought to destroy Yaakov, but did not actually destroy him]. @p1[7]@p2<TIE>This is what Bilam meant .<TIE>.<TIE>. “How can I curse one whom God has not cursed?”@p3 “One” refers to Yaakov, as Rashi explains in Bamidbar 23:8. @p1@p2Another explanation: There will be no poor.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 There is a question on the first explanation: [“I will divide them” is explained. But] what is the meaning of, “And scatter them throughout Israel?” Thus Rashi brings the second explanation. We need not ask: If the second explanation is for, “And scatter them,” why is it considered another explanation? The first explanation [was only for, “I will divide them,” but] did not explain, “And scatter them.” The answer is: The second explanation goes also on, “I will divide them.” [Accordingly, the verse] means as follows: “I will divide them” from one another. And how will I do this? I will “scatter them.” In other words, “And scatter them” comes to explain, “I will divide them.” (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1@p2He allowed his dispersal to be more honorable.@p3 “I will divide @ITthem@it throughout Yaakov” refers to Shimon. “Scatter @ITthem@it throughout Yisroel” refers to Leivi. Therefore [referring to Leivi] it is written “Yisroel,” which is a more honorable [as compared to “Yaakov”]. @p1[8]@p2<TIE>In the days of Dovid.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because Yaakov should have blessed Yehudah with, “You shall rule over nations,” or, “You shall be king.” Why did he say, “Your hand will be on the neck.<TIE>.<TIE>.”? To allude to Dovid. (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1[9]@p2<TIE>Likewise, when Tamar was sentenced to die.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is saying that “my son” refers to Yehudah, not to Yoseif. [There are two proofs to support this:] First, Yehudah as well was Yaakov’s son, [so the verse would not say, “You (Yehudah) have risen above plundering my son (Yoseif).”] Second, Yehudah removed himself also from the plundering of Tamar, as Rashi explains. If he removed himself from plundering them both, why would it say [only] “my son,” referring to Yoseif? Perforce, “my son” refers to Yehudah. @p1[10]@p2<TIE>From Dovid and on.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the objection: Until Shaul there was no king in Israel! Thus Rashi explains that it means, “From Dovid and on,” and Dovid is from the tribe of Yehudah. @p1@p2King Moshiach that the kingdom is his.@p3 This refers back to the beginning of the verse. It means: “The rod” of rulership “will not depart from Yehudah,” and even during exile they will have a limited authority, continuing “until Shiloh comes,” the one “that the rod is his.” Rashi says “kingdom” instead of “rod”, but it means the same. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1@p2A Midrashic interpretation @HB<HEB>שי לו@BO<ENG>, a present unto him.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 The Midrash explains Shiloh as referring to the redeemer, but instead of saying that @hh<HEB>שילו@ee<ENG> means @hh<HEB>שלו@ee<ENG> (his), it is two words: @hh<HEB>שי לו@ee<ENG> — “a present unto him.” @p1@p2The eye that mocks the father and despises @HB<HEB>ליקהת אם@BO<ENG> the gathering of wrinkles upon her face. @boRashi is citing a proof that @hh<HEB>יקהת@ee<ENG> with one @hh<HEB>י@ee<ENG> means gathering. @p1@p2They sat and gathered @HB<HEB>אקהתא@BO<ENG> [assemblies] in the streets.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 They gathered assemblies around themselves, which came to hear their words; see there.<QC>
@p1[11]@p2<TIE>Onkelos explains as referring to the King Moshiach.@p3 Accordingly, @hh<HEB>אוסרי לגפן עירה@ee<ENG> means: Israel will surround the city of Jerusalem. @hh<HEB>ולשורקה בני אתונו@ee<ENG> means: Israel will build the Temple. @p1@p2From the idea: Those who ride on white donkeys.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 This verse refers to Torah scholars. @hh<HEB>צחורות@ee<ENG> means white. I.e., Torah scholars who wear white garments [are riding on donkeys]. Alternatively, it means they ride on white donkeys from place to place in order to learn Torah.<QC>
@p1[13]@p2<TIE>His land will be by the @HB<HEB>חוף ימים@BO<ENG>.@p3 [@ITRe’m@it explains that @hh<HEB>חוף ימים@ee<ENG> does not mean “seashore.” It means “border town.” And] since it is written @hh<HEB>ישכון@ee<ENG>, implying his dwelling place, this refers to his land — which will be on the border [between Eretz Yisrael and foreign lands]. But he himself will [not be there; he will] be at “a harbor of ships.” I.e., he will spend time [away from his land,] at the port where the ships bring merchandise. @ITNachalas Yaakov@it rejected all this and said that the land of Zevulun was at the edge of the sea, the dividing place between Eretz Yisrael and foreign lands; thus all the ships passed through his land. See there.<QC>
@p1[16]@p2<TIE>All the tribes of Israel will be as one with him.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., this phrase [should be understood] as if it is backwards. It means: “Dan will avenge his people, all of Israel together (@hh<HEB>כאחד@ee<ENG>).” For Shimshon avenged all of Israel together. @hh<HEB>ידין@ee<ENG> cannot mean “will judge,” because we do not find anywhere [that Dan judged all of Israel]. @p1[17]@p2<TIE>It is so named because it hisses.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 @hh<HEB>נושף@ee<ENG> is a sort of whistling. So did Rashi explain before on 3:15.<QC>
@p1[20]@p2<TIE>Moshe, too, blessed him thus.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [You might ask: Why does Rashi need this proof?] The answer is: Rashi cites the proof from Moshe Rabbeinu so we will not object: How does Rashi know that here, @hh<HEB>שמנה@ee<ENG> means oil? Perhaps it means Asher’s food will be good and rich. Thus he brings a proof from Moshe. For it is evident that Moshe blessed them the same way Yaakov blessed them, and there it is clearly written, “He will dip his foot in oil.”<QC>
@p1[21]@p2<TIE>Due to them, Devorah and Barak sang.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: It is written @hh<HEB>אילה שלוחה@ee<ENG>, in the feminine form. Why then is it written @hh<HEB>הנותן@ee<ENG>, in the masculine form? Therefore Rashi explains, “Devorah and Barak sang.<TIE>.<TIE>.” [and due to Barak, @hh<HEB> הנותן@ee<ENG>is in the masculine form]. @p1@p2Onkelos translates: “His lot will fall”.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is saying that this is how Onkelos actually translates this verse. According to Onkelos, @hh<HEB>הנותן אמרי שפר@ee<ENG> means that Naftali will give thanks with beautiful words for his lot. But when Rashi wrote above, “‘He delivers pleasant sayings,’ as Onkelos translates it,” it means as follows: The first explanation holds that @hh<HEB>אילה שלוחה@ee<ENG> refers to the fruits of Ginosar, according to which @hh<HEB>אמרי שפר@ee<ENG> means as Onkelos said. [I.e., he will give thanks with beautiful words. But this will be interpreted differently:] the people of Naftali will [give thanks by] reciting the appropriate blessing over the fruits.<QC>
@p1@p222 Many daughters climbed — each one.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: [Why does it say] @hh<HEB>בנות@ee<ENG>, implying there were many, and also say @hh<HEB>צעדה@ee<ENG>, implying there was but one? Thus Rashi explains, “Many daughters climbed — each one.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1@p2The letter @HB<HEB>ת@BO<ENG> is added for stylistic purposes.@p3 I.e., it is not the @hh<HEB>ת@ee<ENG> of the feminine form, as it is speaking of a masculine subject. @P1@p2@HB<HEB>פרת@BO<ENG> meaning, being fruitful and multiplying.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: How did Onkelos know that it should be translated so? Thus Rashi explains, “@hh<HEB>פרת@ee<ENG> meaning, being fruitful and multiplying.”<QC>
@p1[23]@p2<TIE>His brothers made him bitter.@p3 [Rashi knows it means his brothers] because at the end of the verse it is written @hh<HEB>בעלי חצים@ee<ENG>, similar to @hh<HEB>ותהי המחצה@ee<ENG> (Bamidbar 31:36), referring to those who are fit to share the inheritance with him, [as Rashi explains]. @p1@p2Potiphar and his wife made him bitter.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows] that it cannot refer to his brothers alone. For then it should say, “They quarreled with him and made him bitter” — as it cannot be that they first embittered his life and then became his antagonists. Perforce, it refers also to Potiphar and his wife.<QC>
@p1[24]@p2<TIE>Because he secretly kept the Torah. This is an addition.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., Onkelos added [an explanation] to the verse. @p1@p2Father and son, @HB<HEB>אבהן ובנין@BO<ENG>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is saying that Onkelos translated @hh<HEB>אבן@ee<ENG> as “father and son.” And how did Onkelos know it means this? Therefore Rashi explains that “@hh<HEB>אבן@ee<ENG> is a contraction of @hh<HEB>אב ובן@ee<ENG>.”<QC>
@p1[25]@p2<TIE>So, too, the word @HB<HEB>שדים@BO<ENG> here.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is explaining how the word @hh<HEB>שדים@ee<ENG> means father. @p1[26]@p2<TIE>@HB<HEB>הריון@BO<ENG> .<TIE>.<TIE>. i.e., “The one who made my mother conceive me”.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is explaining how the word @hh<HEB>הורי@ee<ENG> means father. @hh<HEB>ויפוזו זרועי ידיו@ee<ENG> as @hh<HEB>ויפוצו@ee<ENG>.<TIE>.<TIE>. Rashi is saying that @hh<HEB>ז@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>צ@ee<ENG> often interchange, as in @hh<HEB>זעקת@ee<ENG> which is like @hh<HEB>צעקת@ee<ENG>. @p1@p2@HB<HEB>תאות עולם@BO<ENG> from the same meaning as desire and longing.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Accordingly, @hh<HEB>עד תאות גבעות עולם@ee<ENG> means as follows: the blessings my father gave me were stronger — better — than the blessings Hashem gave my father. This is so, since the great ones [i.e., “the pillars”] of the earth longed for my blessings. And Rashi then explains who longed for them: it was Yaakov’s mother. (@ITsource unknown@it) @p1@p2And @HB<HEB>וגבעות@BO<ENG> .<TIE>.<TIE>. for which his mother longed.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Onkelos explained @hh<HEB>תאות@ee<ENG> as longing. And before that, it is written @hh<HEB>ברכות אביך גברו וגו'@ee<ENG>, which Rashi previously explained as, “The blessings that Hashem blessed me surpassed the blessings that He blessed my forebears.” If so, according to Onkelos, how does the phrase following @hh<HEB>עד תאות גבעות עולם@ee<ENG> fit in? Therefore Rashi explains, “His mother longed for them.” Rashi is saying that according to Onkelos, @hh<HEB>תאות גבעות עולם@ee<ENG> refers to Rivkah, Yaakov’s mother. She desired those blessings and made Yaakov receive them. Therefore she dressed Yaakov in Eisov’s garments that were desired (@hh<HEB>החמודות@ee<ENG>), in order that Yaakov should receive the blessings.<QC>
@p1[27]@p2<TIE>He is a wolf, for he preys.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi is saying that] @hh<HEB>יטרף@ee<ENG> does not apply to @hh<HEB>זאב@ee<ENG>, for [this would not need to be stated since] every wolf preys. Rather, @hh<HEB>יטרף@ee<ENG> applies to Binyamin. It is saying that Binyamin is a wolf because he preys like one. But @ITMaharshal@it explains that [Rashi is answering the objection:] The verse seems to say that Binyamin will prey on the wolf. However, “preying” cannot be said about a person. Thus Rashi explains, “He is a wolf, for he preys.”<QC>
@p1[28]@p2<TIE>“And this is what their father spoke to them”.<TIE>.<TIE>. referring to everything that was said above.@p3 [Rashi is saying] that if not for, “And this is what their father spoke to them,” we would think Yaakov altogether regretted what he had said, and took back his reproach. For it says, “He blessed them,” implying they all [received blessings and not reproaches]. Thus Rashi says, “And this is.<TIE>.<TIE>.” to teach that whatever Yaakov had said remained in force, but he then included them all [in the blessings]. (@ITR. Noson@it) @p1@p2 “He blessed them,” which implies all of them.@p3 I did not find this explanation in any Midrash. Furthermore, it seems odd, for where does it state what Yaakov blessed Reuvein, Shimon and Leivi? If it is because he included them all in one blessing, that was learned from @hh<HEB>ברך אותם@ee<ENG> [at the end of the verse]. If so, why is @hh<HEB>ויברך אותם@ee<ENG> necessary?<QC>
@p1[33]@p2<TIE>Our father Yaakov did not die.@p3 The Gemora in Taanis 5b objects, “Did not the doctors embalm Yaakov (Bereishis 50:2)? And does it not say that his sons carried him from Egypt and buried him in Eretz Yisrael (ibid v. 13)? The answer is: It means he did not taste death, i.e., he did not feel the pain of death. Much more has been said on this subject.<QC>
@p1[3]@p2<TIE>They completed the days of his embalming until forty days.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: [Why does it say @hh<HEB>וימלאו@ee<ENG>?] The term @hh<HEB>מלוי@ee<ENG> (completion) applies only to a predetermined number, such as: “I will fill (@hh<HEB>אמלא@ee<ENG>) the number of your days” (Shemos 23:26), meaning the number of days apportioned to you. Similarly (25:24): “When her days of pregnancy were completed (@hh<HEB>וימלאו@ee<ENG>),” meaning the number of days apportioned for her pregnancy. There are many [other examples of this] in Scripture. But here, there was no predetermined number, so Rashi needed to add: “They completed the days @ITof his embalming@it.” Their period for embalming was for a predetermined number of forty days, as Rashi goes on to say. Rashi says @hh<HEB>השלימו@ee<ENG> instead of @hh<HEB>וימלאו@ee<ENG>, to teach that this @hh<HEB>מילוי@ee<ENG> denotes “completion,” rather than denoting “full” which is the opposite of empty. (@ITRe’m@it) @p1@p2Forty days of the embalming period and thirty for mourning.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi explains] that the seventy days of mourning are not in addition to the forty days mentioned here. @p1@p2Because a blessing had come to them on account of him.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because otherwise, why did they weep? It could not have been to honor Yoseif, because a person cannot weep at will.<QC>
@p1[5]@p2<TIE>Related to @HB<HEB>כרי דגור@BO<ENG>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 @hh<HEB>כרי@ee<ENG> is Hebrew, and @hh<HEB>דגור@ee<ENG> is Aramaic. @p1[6]@p2<TIE>Not to reveal about the Hebrew Language.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Question: If so, how was Yoseif allowed to speak to his brothers in Hebrew? Rashi explained [that Yoseif spoke to them in Hebrew] on, “I speak to you with my own mouth” (45:12). The answer is: Pharaoh stipulated with Yoseif not to speak Hebrew specifically to the Egyptians. When Yoseif spoke to his brothers, no one else was with him in the house, and it did not become known that he spoke to them. (@ITRe’m@it) The @ITNachalas Yaakov@it writes: The real question is that everything Yoseif’s interpreter spoke [to the brothers] was in Hebrew, and many Egyptians were present. Furthermore, @ITRe’m@it contradicts himself, because he wrote on 45:12 that many Egyptians knew Hebrew [since it was the language of the neighboring land of Canaan]. If so, what use was it for Yoseif to swear not to speak in Hebrew, when many Egyptians were speaking it [even though Pharaoh did not understand Hebrew]? See his elaboration there.<QC>
@p1[15]@p2<TIE>Out of respect to his father. But once Yaakov died he no longer received them warmly.@p3 It says in Bereishis Rabbah: “R. Tanchuma said that Yoseif’s intent was for the sake of Heaven, for he reasoned, ‘In the past, my father would seat me above Yehudah who is the king, and above Reuvein who is the firstborn. Now, it is not right for me to sit above them.<TIE>.<TIE>.’” And he did not wish to sit below them, because it would be disrespectful to the royalty [of Egypt]. @p1@p2But there is no other example of this in Scripture.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is saying: although there is no other example in Scripture, still we can say that @hh<HEB>לו@ee<ENG> means @hh<HEB>שמא@ee<ENG> (lest). This is because @hh<HEB>לו@ee<ENG> sometimes means @hh<HEB>אולי@ee<ENG>, (perhaps), as Rashi proved from Scripture. And @hh<HEB>אולי@ee<ENG> sometimes means @hh<HEB>שמא@ee<ENG>. If so, @hh<HEB>לו@ee<ENG> can mean @hh<HEB>שמא@ee<ENG>, since @hh<HEB>לו@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>אולי@ee<ENG> are the same. @p1@p2Sometimes @HB<HEB>אולי@BO<ENG> denotes a wish.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is saying there is another proof that @hh<HEB>לו@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>אולי@ee<ENG> are the same: @hh<HEB>לו@ee<ENG> often means @hh<HEB>בקשה@ee<ENG> (a wish), and @hh<HEB>אולי@ee<ENG> sometimes means @hh<HEB>בקשה@ee<ENG>. Thus we can say that @hh<HEB>לו@ee<ENG> sometimes means @hh<HEB>שמא@ee<ENG> just like @hh<HEB>אולי@ee<ENG> sometimes does. [Rashi adds:] “Sometimes @hh<HEB>אולי@ee<ENG> has the meaning of ‘if’,” [just like @hh<HEB>לו@ee<ENG> does] as Rashi said before. Therefore, @hh<HEB>לו@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>אולי@ee<ENG> are the same. @p1[16]@p2<TIE>Who was it that they charged [to be messengers]? The sons of Bilhah.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because the messenger could not have been an individual who was not their brother. For then Yoseif surely would not believe him, as Yoseif knew that his father did not suspect him of this. But now that they sent one of the brothers to him, to stand in front of him and say, “Father charged me with this message,” Yoseif could not deny its truth. [Another reason the messenger could not have been an individual who was not their brother:] It is not logical that they would divulge to a stranger that they sold their brother. This was a secret and was to their disgrace. It would be more fitting to speak to him themselves. (@ITGur Aryeh@it)<QC>
@p1[21]@p2<TIE>Ten lights cannot extinguish one light.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [You might ask: Why did Yoseif compare them to lights? The answer is:] Because the twelve tribes correspond to the twelve stars which illuminate the whole world. Therefore he mentioned to them “ten lights.” I.e., he was saying that despite their plan to kill him, he was saved from them because each tribe is like a constellation in the heavens which cannot be destroyed. And surely he alone is unable to destroy them. But it cannot simply mean that [since ten could not kill him, surely] he cannot kill ten. This would be no proof because Yoseif was a king and could order a thousand people to kill them. (@ITGur Aryeh@it)<QC>
