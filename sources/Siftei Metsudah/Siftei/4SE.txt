@p1[1]@p2<TIE>Because they are precious.@bo Rashi wishes to explain why the Torah writes all of these details. He answers that “Because they are precious .<TIE>.<TIE>. [Hashem counts them all the time].” He means to say that even without these details one would have to explain why the Torah writes “Take a head count of the entire congregation” (v. 2), given that He had already counted them in Parshas Ki Siso. Therefore one must say that these details are mentioned “Because they are precious.” @d1To know the number of those who remained.@bo It is written [regarding the golden calf] “From the people approximately three thousand men fell” (Shemos 32:28), so by counting the fallen, [Hashem] knew the [number of the] remainder. Thus Rashi explains: When they fell because of the calf He counted the dead to know how many remained alive. @d1And on the first of Iyar He counted them.@bo @ITRe’m@it writes: This count occurred once the Divine Presence had rested among them. Do not ask why [Hashem] did not count them in Nissan when the Divine Presence first rested. He answers that that on the first of Nissan the Divine Presence rested and so when He counted them on the first of Iyar, it was as if He counted them in Nissan. It appears to me that Rashi’s intent here so that you should not ask how he knows that Hashem counted them three times. Perhaps [you may think that] He only counted them twice! This would seem to be the case because the total mentioned here and the one mentioned in Parshas Ki Siso are one and the same. Accordingly, Rashi explains that on the first of Nissan the Mishkon was set up, and on the first of Iyar [Hashem] counted them. Because if this count was the one mentioned previously, why is it written there (Shemos 38:27) that they made sockets for the Mishkon from the silver that they brought as an atonement for the count of their souls, while here it is written that “on the first of Iyar He counted them.” Surely the Mishkon had already been erected on the first of Nissan. Rather, this must have been a different count. You might ask: Why did the Torah not count them immediately after the setting up of the Mishkon, since immediately afterwards the Divine Presence came to rest. The answer is, as we say concerning oaths, (Bava Basra 8a): If one prohibits oneself from benefiting from the residents of a town, he is permitted to benefit from people who have not lived there for thirty days because they are not considered established there. Similarly, Hashem did not count them until the Divine Presence had been established for thirty days. @p1[2]@p2<TIE>The number of each tribe.@bo But not each and every family — because the Torah does not mention a count of families in the subsequent verses, only a count of the tribes (@ITGur Aryeh@it). You might ask: Then why did it write “according to their families”? The answer is that through the families they knew the count of the tribes, as the Torah writes (v. 18), “and they were registered by family ancestry” implying that they were not known by the name of their tribe. Therefore, one must say that it was by their families that Moshe and Aharon knew which tribe they were from. @d1Maintained in his father’s tribe.@bo Meaning that if his father was from one tribe and his mother was from another tribe, he would be maintained in his father’s tribe. However, it does not refer to [a case where] his father was from one family and his mother was from another family, even if they were from the same tribe, as would be understood from the plain meaning of the verse. Because what difference would there be if the father was from the Chanochite family and the mother was from the Paluite family, and consequently they were included among the Chanochites? Since both were from the tribe of Reuven, there would be no difference whether he is established in the family of the father or the mother. @d1Through the shekolim.@bo Rashi wishes to answer why they were counted. Surely a plague comes when one counts them [directly]. Therefore he explains that it was done “through the shekolim.” @p1[3]@p2<TIE>Below the age of twenty.@bo You might ask: From where does Rashi know this? Perhaps even those younger than twenty were eligible for the army. And accordingly, the Torah would be understood as saying that you shall count those from twenty years old and above who are eligible for the army. However, if they are twenty years old but are not eligible, such as the old or sick, or are eligible but are not twenty years old — do not count them. The answer is that if this were so the Torah should have stated “from twenty years and above who are eligible for the army,” why then does the Torah state “@ITall@it those eligible for the army.” Thus, it is certain that the verse must be explained as Rashi says. Similarly, when Rashi writes in Parshas Ki Siso (Shemos 30:14) that below the age of twenty no one is eligible for the army, this is derived from here (@ITRe’m@it). See also Parshas Ki Siso. @p1[4]@p2<TIE>When you count them, there shall be with you.@bo One might ask: From where does Rashi know this? Perhaps they should be with you for other matters, but not when you count them. Furthermore, from where does he know that the Torah refers to the leaders of the tribes, perhaps it refers to other people? The answer is: Since it is later written “these are the ones called from the congregation, the leaders of their fathers’ tribes” (v. 16), one can infer that they were the leaders of the tribes. Furthermore, it is written “Moshe and Aharon took these men .<TIE>.<TIE>. and they gathered together the entire congregation” (vs. 17-18) from there one may infer that they did the counting along with Moshe.<QC>
@p1[16]@p2<TIE>To everything of importance.@bo Rashi wishes to explain: Was their importance [only] that they called to the entire the congregation? Thus Rashi explains they were “invited to everything” meaning they were invited to deliberate and decide matters affecting the congregation. @p1[17]@p2<TIE>Those twelve leaders.@bo Rashi wished to explain: The Torah should have stated “Moshe and Aharon took them,” and since it previously listed the leaders of the congregation we would automatically know that they were the leaders already mentioned. However, it is clear that because it is written “these men” I might now say that it refers to others, not the leaders of the tribes. Therefore, Rashi explains that it does indeed refer to the twelve leaders. Furthermore, if one were to say that they were others, Rashi explains that [this cannot be because] they were “designated to him here by their names,” and it was the leaders who were designated here by name. The phrase “to him” was added because without it, it would not be known to whom they were designated. One might ask: From where does Rashi know to explain so, perhaps they were indeed others? The answer is: It is written @hh<HEB>האנשים האלה@ee<ENG> (those [specific] men) with a @IThei@it (implying the definite article) rather than @hh<HEB>אנשים אלה@ee<ENG>. @eeIf one asks: Then why does it not simply say they “took them,” as the @ITMinchas Yehudah@it asks? The answer appears to be: The Torah initially said “the head of the fathers’ house” (v.4) while now it says “the leaders of their fathers’ tribes” (v.16). Thus, one might think that the heads of the fathers’ houses were not the leaders of the tribes, only of their families. And when here the Torah writes “the ones called from the congregation, leaders of their fathers’ tribes” it refers to the leaders themselves — but those listed above were indeed others. Consequently the Torah here would have said “the ones called from the congregation” only to inform us that they are the ones called “to any matter of importance.” For this reason the Torah states “these [specific] men” to teach that they were the very same leaders listed above. @ITMaharshal@it writes that Rashi is answering the question: Why did the Torah write “who were designated by name,” when it would be sufficient to write “these men”? Therefore he explains that they were designated to him here by name, as a matter of importance, that they were worthy of their greatness and leadership. This is in contrast to the spies who were referred to by name in disgrace, due to what would befall them in the end, as is taught in @ITMidrash Rabbah.@it @p1[18]@p2<TIE>Genealogical documents and witnesses.@bo Rashi was obliged to explain so because the word @hh<HEB>ויתילדו@ee<ENG> is from the reflexive @hh<HEB>התפעל@ee<ENG> construct. Thus, according to its simple meaning as a term of giving birth, it would imply that they caused themselves to give birth. Therefore Rashi explains that they themselves brought their genealogical documents. @d1Verified the status of their birth.@bo The word @hh<HEB>חזקת@ee<ENG> (status) is a term of honor. Rashi explains so in Parshas Behar (Vayikro 25:41) where “he returns to his fathers’ possession” alludes to his fathers’ status, a term of honor. @p1[49]@p2<TIE>Counted separately.@bo Meaning that they would not be counted from the age of twenty, but from the age of one month. Since the Levites were the legion of the King, the Levites’ children who had passed the stage when a baby may be categorized as stillborn, were considered as important as those who go forth into the army of Israel. @d1Another interpretation; .<TIE>.<TIE>. foresaw.@bo According to the first reason, one could ask why it is written @hh<HEB>אך@ee<ENG> (however), because the word @hh<HEB>אך@ee<ENG> always comes to exclude something. Therefore Rashi explained here that exclusion was from the decree that those aged over twenty should die in the desert. One might ask: Rashi should have said that they did not err during the episode of the spies, whereas the decree of death in the desert was due to this. The answer is: Even the Levites erred in the episode of the spies, and it was only with the golden calf that they did not err. Therefore, they were not punished [for the episode of the spies] given that even the rest of Yisroel were only punished because of these two sins together. Rashi proves this in Parshas Shlach Lecha (Bamidbar 14:33), where the Torah writes “bear your @ITsins@it” rather than “bear your @ITsin@it.” Consequently, it is certain that two sins of the golden calf and of the spies were the cause. [You might question:] Rashi explains later in Parshas Devarim (Devarim 1:23) that the Levites were not with them at the sending of the spies, or even at the decision to do so, as we will explain later. The answer is: Initially at the sending they were not with them, even for the decision, however when the spies returned and made an evil report about the land —when the entire congregation raised their voices and wept — the tribe of Levi was included in that weeping. They too said “why would Hashem bring us .<TIE>.<TIE>. to fall by the sword, our women and children to be taken captive.” With this, one may also answer the question that is widely asked: Even if they were counted from the age of twenty, if the Levites did not sin they would not have been included in the decree — because “it is not the serpent that causes death rather it is sin.” Thus we can certainly see that the Levites sinned during the episode of the spies and because of this they were not counted. @p1[50]@p2<TIE>Authority.@bo One might ask: Why does Rashi explain that this word is to be understood as the Targum translates (with the word @hh<HEB>מני@ee<ENG> — “appoint”), was it merely so that one would not say that @hh<HEB>הפקד@ee<ENG> (appoint) is a term of counting? What answer is this, given that the Targum also renders terms of counting with the word @hh<HEB>מני@ee<ENG>? The answer is: Wherever the Targum uses the word @hh<HEB>מני@ee<ENG> for an appointment to authority, the @ITnun@it is punctuated with a dagesh (@hh<HEB>מנּי@ee<ENG>), and here is also punctuated so. Thus we may infer that it refers to an appointment to authority. However, when the @ITnun@it of the word @hh<HEB>מני@ee<ENG> is not punctuated, it refers to counting. Another answer is that Rashi explains that the word is to be understood as the Targum translates, because the word @hh<HEB>הפקד@ee<ENG> is also a term of remembrance, as in “Hashem @hh<HEB>פקד@ee<ENG> (remembered) Sarah” (Bereishis 21:1) and sometimes it is a term of omission as with “and not one of us is missing” (Bamidbar 31:49). Therefore Rashi explains that it is to be understood as the Targum translates, to exclude those two explanations (remembrance and omission) of the word. One is unable to say that it is a term of counting; therefore he explains that it is to be understood as in the phrase “let the king appoint officials.” @p1[51]@p2<TIE>As Targum translates, “they shall dismantle.”@bo Meaning that they dismantle the parts of the Mishkon, separating them from the place where they are attached and leaving each piece on its own. However, they did not take it down from a high place to a low place, as might be understood from the term “take down.” @d1When they were going to depart.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Why is it written @hh<HEB>ובנסוע המשכן@ee<ENG> (lit. when the Mishkon moved), did the Mishkon move? — Surely the people would move it! Furthermore he answers the question: Did they not dismantle it before the journey? Yet the verse implies that they would dismantle during the time of the journey. Therefore Rashi explains: “When they were going to depart” meaning that the departure is referring to the people. He added that they would “carry it<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” so that you would not say that only the taking down was an obligation of the Levites, but not the carrying. Even though there is no mention here of their carrying it, it is inferred in a later passage, as explained in Parshas Naso (Bamidbar 4:25, 31). @d1To [perform] this service of theirs.@bo This is the dismantling and the assembly. Rashi wishes to answer the question: Scripture had already warned several times that one who comes close to perform the service of the altar or who enters the sanctuary would die. Therefore he explains that “to [perform] this service” refers to the dismantling and assembly of the Mishkon. It does not refer to approaching the altar. @d1By the hand of heaven.@bo One might ask: From where does Rashi know this, surely any death penalty mentioned by the Torah that is not detailed, normally refers to strangulation. The answer is: Rashi himself explains this shortly (v. 53) where he writes that “so that there will not be anger<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” refers to death at the hand of heaven, as one finds in the section dealing with Korach, “for the anger had emerged” (Bamidbar 17:11) which refers to death at the hand of heaven. See also above in Parshas Emor (Vayikro 22:9).<QC>
@p1[53]@p2<TIE>There will be anger.@bo There are those who ask: In all of the Torah inferences are mentioned, and from one side of the inference you may infer the other [so what is Rashi adding]? The answer is: Rashi elaborates here so that you do not err and say that when the Torah writes “so that there will not be anger” it refers to that which was juxtaposed to it “Bnei Yisroel shall camp .<TIE>.<TIE>. and the Levites shall camp<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (v. 52-53). Therefore, Rashi explains “if you fulfill my commandments .<TIE>.<TIE>. and if you do not fulfill my commandments<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” which refers to the service of the Mishkon — it’s dismantling, loading and assembly, “as we find in the episode of Korach.” @d1As we find.@bo Rashi says this because of his explanation above where he said that they would die at the hand of heaven. So that one should not question his source, he mentions the incident with Korach.<QC>
@p1[2]@p2<TIE>Each one's color.@bo Thus the meaning of “their fathers’ houses” was the names of their fathers that were engraved on the breastplate. But since this is a forced explanation in the understanding of “their fathers’ houses,” Rashi gives another explanation. Nonetheless, according to the other explanation one may question the connection between the word “banner” and “the insignia of their fathers’ houses,” therefore he also needs the first explanation. @d1When they carried him.@bo Meaning that accordingly one must say that “banner” is a term of gathering as in “@hh<HEB>ודגלו עלי@ee<ENG> (and encamped around me)” (Shir HaShirim 2:4). This teaches that each banner was with its group.<QC>
@d1At the distance of a @BImil@bo. One might ask: Previously in Parshas Yisro (Shemos 19:2), Rashi explained that@hh<HEB>נגד ההר @ee<ENG> (opposite the mountain) meant to its east, because any time that you find the word@hh<HEB>נגד @ee<ENG> it implies facing east, even if it comes as a construct (opposite @ITsomething@it). The answer is: Here it is written “around the Tent of Meeting they shall encamp” so it is not possible that they were all facing east. Thus Rashi explains that it is a term of distance. Furthermore, I have found that one may learn this through a gezeirah shavah (comparison); the Torah here says @hh<HEB>מנגד@ee<ENG> (opposite) and elsewhere it says @hh<HEB>ותשב מנגד הרחק@ee<ENG> (“and sat facing him about the distance”) (Bereishis 21:16). Thus, just as there it refers to distance, so too here it refers to the distance. @eeA @ITmil@it is a distance of two thousand @ITamos@it [the maximum distance] that one may travel on Shabbos. @p1[3]@p2<TIE>This is the eastern side.@bo One might ask: From where does Rashi know this? One may explain that since west is called the rear one may infer that the front is the east. @eeAn alternative explanation: A @IThei@it at the end of a word is in place of a @ITlamed@it at the beginning. Thus, since@hh<HEB>קדם @ee<ENG> means @hh<HEB>פנים@ee<ENG> (front — lit. face) it is clear that @hh<HEB>קדמה@ee<ENG> would mean @hh<HEB>לפנים@ee<ENG> (towards the front) while the word@hh<HEB>מזרחה @ee<ENG> would also mean towards the east. (@ITGur Aryeh@it) One might ask: Why does the Torah write the repetitive phrase @hh<HEB>קדמה מזרחה@ee<ENG> (in the forefront to the eastern side)? It appears that it wishes to teach us that because Yehudah held the kingship he was to be given the side that was most important. Therefore the east was referred to in terms of being “first” and “in the forefront.” If the Torah had written @hh<HEB>מזרחה@ee<ENG> or @hh<HEB>קדמה@ee<ENG> alone we would not have learned this point.<QC>
@p1[9]@p2<TIE>When they see the cloud.@bo Rashi is answering the question: How did they know when to travel in order that they would be first to travel. For one cannot say that they traveled at their own volition, since the Torah writes “on the word of Hashem did they travel” (Bamidbar 9:18). Thus Rashi explains, “When they saw the cloud<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @ITRe’m@it writes that one might question: Why does Rashi omit Moshe’s declaration “Arise Hashem<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (Bamidbar 10:35) and only mention the lifting of the cloud and the blowing of the trumpets? It appears that Rashi only comes to explain how they knew to prepare themselves to travel, and he says that they knew this “when they see the cloud rise.” However, the actual journey was not until Moshe said “Arise Hashem.” Thus when the verse writes “they travel first” it means that they were the first to prepare themselves to travel. I will write more about this in Parshas Beha’aloscha (ibid). (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @eeI myself say that Rashi omitted this, because in Parshas Beha’aloscha he also brings the Beraysa on the verse “on the word of Hashem did they travel” (Bamidbar 9:18), and that they traveled in response to three things. (See Rashi Bamidbar 1:2) See there. @d1The way they camped.@bo This is according to the view that they traveled in the shape of a box. The explanation of the term “gatherer for all of the camps” (Bamidbar 10:25), that is written concerning Don, means that if anyone from the tribes who had already traveled lost something, Don would return it to them. However, Rashi does not mean to say that the banner of the tribe of Don was the very last of all the banners, in accordance with the opinion that they traveled in the shape of a beam.<QC>
@p1[17]@p2<TIE>After those two banners.@bo Meaning that “in the center of the camps” refers to the four camps of Israel, two in front and two behind. But it does not mean that it was between the camps mentioned above (vs. 3-16), i.e. between the camps of Yehudah and Reuven, given that it is written “the Tent of Meeting shall travel” after [mentioning] the banners of Yehudah and Reuven. @p1[20]@p2<TIE>As Targum translates “the one near him.”@bo Previously (v. 5, 12) Rashi did not need to explain the word @hh<HEB>עליו@ee<ENG> (with him, lit. “above him”) because the Torah added the words “those who camp.” Thus it was obvious that the  explanation is as Targum translates. However here where it does not add anything, but merely states “along with him is the tribe of Menashe,” I would not know the meaning of the word @hh<HEB>ועליו@ee<ENG>, therefore Rashi explains “as Targum translates.” @p1[1]@p2<TIE>Since he taught them what he had learned.@bo Otherwise [i.e. if the Torah did not say this], what relevance does this point have here. Thus Rashi explains that @hh<HEB>ביום דיבר@ee<ENG> (lit. @ITon@it the day that He spoke) means “@ITfrom@it the day that He spoke,” and that the letter @ITbeis@it is like the @ITbeis@it in@hh<HEB> והנותר בבשר ובלחם @ee<ENG>(that which is left @ITfrom@it the meat and @ITfrom@it the bread) (Vayikro 8:32). It was not on the day that Hashem spoke to Moshe on Har Sinai that he taught them, rather from that day onwards he taught them and thus they became his descendants. One might ask: Surely all of Israel learned Torah from Moshe, so why were they not [also] called his descendants? The answer is: When he taught Torah to the whole of Yisroel it was at the command of Hashem, as it is written “Hashem said to Moshe come up to me .<TIE>.<TIE>. that I wrote to instruct them” (Shemos 24:12). This implies that the main reason for Hashem teaching Moshe was for [Moshe to teach] the people of Yisroel. Therefore it is not correct to say that [regarding them that] “one who teaches another’s son<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” However regarding Aharon’s sons, Moshe was not obligated to teach them, given that only a father is obligated to teach his son Torah, therefore they were called the descendants of Moshe. This appears to the precise meaning of the wording “anyone who teaches @ITanother’s@it son Torah<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1[4]@p2<TIE>During his lifetime.@bo There are texts that read “In the presence of Aharon their father@ee—@ee during his lifetime.” One might ask: Why did Rashi explain “during his lifetime.” The answer is that if he had not explained so, one would say that this was after his death, because they were not fitting to serve when [Aharon] was present. Therefore Rashi explains, in the presence of Aharon their father, in his lifetime they were made Kohanim Gadolim, meaning that if Aharon became impure then Elazar would serve, and if Elazar became impure then Isamar would serve (@ITTanchuma@it).<QC>
@p1[6]@p2<TIE>They shall preserve.@bo These are not two topics — that they would serve, and also preserve their guardianship, because there is no other service aside from the guarding of the sanctuary which was the service of Aharon and his sons.<QC>
@p1[9]@p2<TIE>For assistance.@bo Meaning for the holy service, but not for mundane work. Rashi’s proof is from that which is mentioned in Parshas Korach, “that I have given you a gift to perform the work of the Tent of Meeting” (Bamidbar 18:6). From there one may infer that it was specifically for holy service, but not for the mundane. @d1From [among] the rest of the entire congregation.@bo Rashi is answering the question: The term @hh<HEB>מאת בני ישראל@ee<ENG> (from the Bnei Yisroel) implies that they were under the ownership of the Bnei Yisroel and that they gave them to the Kohanim, but this was not the case. Furthermore, the Torah writes “Behold! I have taken the Levites from among Bnei Yisroel<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (v. 12) implying that Hashem was the one who gave them, not Bnei Yisroel. Thus Rashi explains that this is to be understood as @hh<HEB>מתוך@ee<ENG> (from among).<QC>
@p1[15]@p2<TIE>She bore her, yet she is counted.@bo You might ask: Previously the Torah writes “from the age of one month and above” (Bamidbar 1:49) meaning that when they can no longer be categorized as stillborn they were counted. The answer is that here she certainly was not considered stillborn because [it was clear from birth that] she had completed her months [of gestation], therefore she was counted from the time of birth, before thirty days. (@ITGur Aryeh@it) It was specifically there that she was counted in the womb because she certainly was not to be considered stillborn — because when the Torah was written in the days of Moshe she had already passed the stage where there was a question that she might be considered stillborn. Therefore Yocheved was counted immediately. In addition, even though they were counted here through Divine Inspiration, he did not want to count them until they had completed one month in order not to make distinctions. @p1[16]@p2<TIE>How can I enter.@bo (@ITGur Aryeh@it) This raises a difficulty: Was it due to the effort involved that he did not wish to enter their tents? In other words, was that [the reason why] they were counted according to the word of Hashem? It appears that the explanation is that because it is dishonorable for a scholar to enter a tent where there are women, therefore he said “How can I enter into their tents.<TIE>.<TIE>.?” @p1[21]@p2<TIE>The family of Livni.@bo There are texts that read “the first was to explain who his children were”. Rashi is answering the question: Why does the Torah write this twice, since above it is written “these are the names of Gershon’s sons<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (v. 18)? He answers that the first time was to explain who his children were, and the second was to say that for Gershon the family of Livni and the family of Shim’i numbered so many and so many. According to our text one may also explain, that the verse does not come to inform us who his families were, since we already knew this. Rather this verse comes to inform us that the count of the families of Livni and Shim’i were so many and so many — as if it had said “Of Gershon the family of Livni and the family of Shim’i which are the families of Gershon — their numbers were so many and so many.” @d1Their numbers were so many and so many.@bo Rashi is answering the question: The term “Of Gershon, the family of Livni” implies that Gershon was from the family of Livni and this is not the case, because the family of Livni was from the family of Gershon. Therefore he explains “Meaning, of Gershon those who were counted<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”<QC>
@p1[25]@p2<TIE>The lower drapes.@bo Why were they called the Mishkon — because they were seen from inside when one stood in the Mishkon. Furthermore, the Torah writes “You shall make the Mishkon — ten drapes<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (Shemos 26:1) which refers to the lowest of the four covers, not to the Mishkon as a whole, as in “You shall erect the Mishkon” (Shemos 26:30) (@ITRe’m@it). @d1The goats’ hair drapes.@bo Why was this called the @hh<HEB>אהל@ee<ENG> (tent) — because it made an @hh<HEB>אהל @ee<ENG>(roof) over the lower drapes. @d1Ram skins.@bo You might ask: Why is it written “its cover” which implies that the ram and tachash skins were all one cover, while elsewhere it implies that each one was a separate cover on its own. The answer is that each one was certainly a separate material in of itself, however they were joined together in the middle and therefore they were both called “the cover”. Furthermore, you might ask: Shouldn’t the Torah have called them “the tent” since they too formed a roof over the goats’ hair drapes? The answer is that the goats’ hair drapes can understandably be called “the tent,” because they covered the top and the sides of the Mishkon they protected it from every direction. However the red ram and tachash skins only covered the top of the Mishkon, therefore they were called “the cover”. @d1The drape.@bo This is a [vertical] partition that divides, not something that was spread on top as the term @hh<HEB>מסך@ee<ENG> implies. @p1[26]@p2<TIE>Of the Mishkon and the tent.@bo Because the sons of Merari carried the ropes of the enclosure. See Rashi to Parshas Naso (Bamidbar 4:32).<QC>
@p1[29]@p2<TIE>Woe to the wicked.@bo The question is widely raised: Why does Rashi explain all of this here? The answer is that he is answering the question: Why did the Torah not write “the families of the children of @hh<HEB>הקהתי@ee<ENG> (@ITthe@it Kehosites)” as it writes in the next verse — “of the families of the Kehosites,” and above (v. 27) — “these are the families of the Kehosites”? He explains that this was because “Near them was the banner of Reuven<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” They sinned and they caused the congregation to sin, thus it was not correct to write the Name [of Hashem] — with the @IThei@it at the beginning and the @ITyud@it at the end together with their name. (The letters @ITyud hei@it together comprise one of Hashem’s names.) @d1And two hundred and fifty men together with Korach.@bo Most of them were from the tribe of Reuven, as we see later in Parshas Korach. It is written in @ITGur Aryeh@it that Rashi comes to explain why regarding the children of Gershon the Torah writes (v. 23) “behind the Mishkon they shall camp, on the west” and regarding the children of Merori it states (v. 35) “on the side of the Mishkon they shall camp, on the north”. However here it is written “they shall camp on the side of the Mishkon, on the south” [without juxtaposing the word @hh<HEB>יחנו@ee<ENG> (they shall camp)] to the word @hh<HEB>לתימנה@ee<ENG> (on the south). This is to teach that the Torah here does not come to instruct them to camp on the south, rather they were already to the south, and it is as if the Torah had written “they shall camp on the side of the Mishkon where they are presently camping”. And for what reason does the Torah teach this? — To say that “This is why they were drawn<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”<QC>
@p1[32]@p2<TIE>Appointed over all of them.@bo The language in the verse implies that he was like one of the other leaders, (@ITa@it leader of the leaders of Levi) and no more. This is so because in the word @hh<HEB>ונשיא@ee<ENG> (the leader) the @ITvav@it is vowelized with a @ITshuruk@it (@hh<HEB>וּנשיא@ee<ENG>) which means that it is connected to the word following (the leaders), otherwise it should have been vowelized with a @ITshva@it under the @ITvav@it and a @ITkometz@it under the @ITnun@it (@hh<HEB>וְנָשיא@ee<ENG>). Therefore Rashi needed to explain that “He was appointed<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”<QC>
@p1[38]@p2<TIE>Near them.@bo (@ITGur Aryeh@it) Here too, Rashi comes to answer the question: It should have stated “Moshe, Aharon and his sons shall camp in front of the Tent of Meeting.” However the Torah is not coming to instruct them, only to inform that those who camped in front of the Tent of Meeting were these important individuals, therefore those people who camped near them were like them. @p1[39]@p2<TIE>There are dots over @HB<HEB>ואהרן@ee<ENG>. Meaning that only Moshe was involved in the counting of the Levites. (The dots imply that the word should not really be there, as if it were erased. See Bereishis, 33:4.) However, since both of them were involved in the count of the Israelites it is the manner of the Torah to write like this. Even though he did not take part in the count of the Levites he was still mentioned along with the count. There are those who explain Rashi’s words “he was not included in the counting of the Levites” to mean that he was not one of those who was counted. This is also implied in Tractate Bechoros 4a. However this raises a difficulty because the verse refers to those who did the counting — “whom Moshe and Aharon counted” — and not to those who were counted (@ITRe’m@it). @eeIt appears to me that the correct explanation is as follows: The dots above Aharon’s name imply that he was not included in those who did the counting nor in those who were counted, because if not so why would the Torah mention Aharon and then place dots over his name. Therefore, so that you do not [mistakenly] say that he was @ITnot@it included in doing the counting, but he @ITwas@it one of those who were counted, there are dots over his name to teach that he was absent from everything, even those who were counted. This explanation is somewhat similar to the explanation that I gave for the words @hh<HEB>את צאן@ee<ENG> (Bereishis 37:12) where there are dots over @hh<HEB>את@ee<ENG>. Even though this explanation is somewhat forced, it helps to resolve a difficulty so that Rashi’s explanation in Chumash will not contradict his explanation in Tractate Bechoros where he explicitly says that Aharon was not included in the count. Similarly one can understand the statement of Bamidbar Rabbah: “The number of all the Levites whom Moshe and Aharon counted” — there are dots over his name because Aharon was not included in the count. The statement implies that he was not included in those who were counted. @d1For them to release themselves.@bo (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) I have a difficulty with this: How can one say that the redemption of five shekolim would apply to the firstborn Levites? Surely the main reason for the redemption was that initially the firstborn were sanctified to perform the service of the offerings. However, since they sinned in the incident with the golden calf they were invalidated to perform the service, and their sanctity was transferred to the Levites who were not involved in the sin with the calf. This was the redemption of their sanctity; therefore the Torah says that those 273 remaining firstborn, whose sanctity did not have anyone to whom to be transferred, would have their sanctity removed by the giving of five shekolim. And [the removal of sanctity in this manner] is just like any sanctified property, which can be redeemed with money. But if this were the case, the firstborn Levites who were not involved in the sin with the calf would not have had their sanctity invalidated, so why then did they need to be redeemed? Consequently the question remains: Why did the two hundred and seventy-three firstborn need to give five shekolim, given that there were three hundred Levites. The explanation appears to be that we know that sanctified property cannot redeem sanctified property, rather mundane property redeems sanctified property and the sanctity becomes attached to the mundane property. However it is not possible for sanctified property to redeem sanctified property, since it is already sanctified. Similarly here, the twenty-two thousand Levites were ‘mundane’ until now; therefore the sanctity of the firstborn could be transferred to them. However the three hundred Levites who were firstborn and who were not involved in the sin with the calf, remained in their sanctified state for service, thus they could not take the place of the firstborn since they were already fit to serve in the Mishkon. Therefore, a firstborn could not release another firstborn and they needed to redeem their sanctity with five shekolim.<QC>
@p1[45]@p2<TIE>But [they did redeem] the firstlings of their donkeys.@bo There are those who explain that Rashi is answering the question: If the verse refers to kosher animals it would not be possible to redeem them, because the sanctity of a firstborn would not be released given that the kohanim themselves were obligated regarding the sanctity of the first animals. One may say further that Rashi’s proof is from Parshas Bo where it is written “and every firstling donkey you shall redeem with a sheep… and every firstborn man you shall redeem” (Shemos 13:13), thus here it also refers to [the redemption of a firstborn man, and] the firstborn animal, refers solely to the firstling donkeys. (@ITRe’m@it) This is puzzling: Surely Rashi himself explains differently in the first chapter of Bechoros (4a), concerning Rava’s challenge to Abaye. [Rava says:] If you are correct, that one can learn a @ITkal vachomer@it (a fortiori reasoning) from the case of an animal then the Levites should be exempt from the redemption of firstborn kosher animals! [Since the Levites’ kosher animals are not exempt, Abaye’s @ITkal vachomer@it must also be false.] – [there Rashi explains:] because their kosher animals released the kosher animals of the Israelites. The matter requires investigation. However perhaps the answer is that the challenge made by Rava upon Abaye was only according his own reasoning, however Abaye disagrees and holds that the animals of the Levites did @ITnot@it redeem the kosher firstborn animals of the Israelites. See @ITMinchas Yehudah@it. @d1But did not count the extra animals.@bo (@ITRe’m@it) It is puzzling how he brought this proof which the Talmud (Bechoros 4b) had already negated? The Talmud [disproved this by saying] that perhaps the [Levites] had many animals which were equal in number to the firstborn [animals] of the Israelites. [The Talmud] brings another proof: The verse says @hh<HEB>ואת בהמת הלוים תחת בהמתם@ee<ENG> (lit. and the @ITanimal@it of the Levites instead of the Israelites’ animals@ee)@ee implying that one animal was in place of many. Because if you would think that @hh<HEB>ואת בהמת הלוים@ee<ENG> refers to many animals, then the verse should have either written @hh<HEB>בהמת@ee<ENG> both times or @hh<HEB>בהמתם@ee<ENG> both times. [However since it changed its language,] we see that one animal exempted many. He answers that Rashi discarded the second proof because it was far from the simple reading of the verse, and therefore he brought the first proof. @p1[46]@p2<TIE>Take five shekolim.@bo In order that you do not err and say that “the @hh<HEB>פדויי@ee<ENG> (redemption) of the 273<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” is to be explained like “those whose numbers were in excess of those @hh<HEB>פדויי@ee<ENG> (redeemed) through the Levites” (v. 49). There Rashi explains that [the word @hh<HEB>פדויי@ee<ENG>] refers to “those redeemed by the very presence of the Levites.” Thus you might think that you should also take five shekolim from them. Therefore, Rashi explained that “the redemption of the 273<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” refers to the firstborn who @ITrequired@it redemption, because they did not have anyone to redeem them and from them you should “take five shekolim from each individual.”<QC>
@p1[50]@p2<TIE>Twenty-two thousand slips.@bo Meaning pieces of paper. Similarly “inscribed in a book” (Iyov 19:23), is translated by the Targum as @hh<HEB>בפתקא יתרשמון@ee<ENG>, meaning “on slips they shall be noted.” (@ITDivrei Dovid@it) This is the view of Rabbi Yehudah, however Rabbi Nechemyah questions this: If all of the slips marked “Levite” were gone and I drew one —what would I get? Who could tell me that if there had been a “Levite” slip there, that I would not have merited it? Rather Moshe did the following: He wrote upon twenty-two thousand two hundred and seventy-three slips “Levite,” and upon two hundred and seventy-three slips [he wrote] “five shekolim.” @ITRe’m@it writes that one may even question this: Even so, the last ones to draw could say that if they had drawn first when there were many “Levite” slips — twenty-two thousand two hundred and seventy-three and only two hundred and seventy-three “five shekolim” slips — who could say that they would not have drawn “Levite” slips, based on the dictum, @hh<HEB>כל מה דפריש מרובא קפריש@ee<ENG> — “whatever is separated [from a group] is [assumed to have been] separated from the majority [of the group].” Apparently the answer is that whoever drew a slip would then toss it back into the container so that the number of slips there was always equal. @eeHowever this raises the difficulty: If so, perhaps all of them would draw a “Levite” slip, one after the other and the initial problem would remain. One cannot say that as soon as twenty-two thousand “Levite” slips had been drawn, the remaining would be “five shekolim” slips and they would inevitably be required to redeem themselves. Because if so who would want to draw last instead of drawing first. Unless we say that they drew according to their age or their importance, which is difficult to propose. There are those who answer that it is known that whatever Moshe did was through Divine Inspiration, therefore there were no complaints. However this is untenable, because if so why was there a lottery at all; let Moshe say to each person “You are obliged to redeem yourself,” and “You are exempt,” all through Divine Inspiration. However, it appears to me that [this whole question is really] no difficulty: At the end of the first chapter of Kesubos we establish that @hh<HEB>כל קבוע כמחצה על מחצה דמי@ee<ENG> — “anything that is fixed [in a single location] is considered to be half in half.” This is so even where it leads to a leniency, such as a case where someone threw a rock into a group of ten people comprising nine Jews and one was a gentile. Even if the person killed is a Jew the thrower is exempt from the death penalty because the one gentile who was among them (being viewed as a fixed group) is considered as if he comprised half of the group. This law was clear to every Jew in all matters and therefore there would have been no complaint here. Even if the minority of the slips had been marked “Levite,” since the [slips of paper] were fixed [in a single location] there they would have been considered as numerous as the majority. @ITNachalas Yaakov@it explains that the Talmud Yerushalmi writes that the slips came out alternately, one “Levite” and one “five shekolim” in a miraculous fashion. @p1[2]@p2<TIE>For the service of carrying.@bo Rashi intends to explain the reason for the count: All those enumerated are normally counted from one month, from twenty or from thirteen years of age, but this number is not similar to any other. Therefore he explains “count those among them suited<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @ITRe’m@it.<QC>
@p1[5]@p2<TIE>When the cloud rises.@bo Meaning that one should not raise the difficulty: How did they know the time that they were to travel, in order to begin to dismantle the Mishkon? Because it is not respectful for the Holy Ark to be covered after the banner of the camp of Yehudah had traveled — since it would appear that the departure of the banner of Yehudah was the reason to dismantle the Mishkon and to cover the Ark.<QC>
@p1[9]@p2<TIE>In which the oil [and wicks] are placed.@bo The word @hh<HEB>נרותיה@ee<ENG> (its lamps) does not refer to the wick that is lit as [it does] in “the lamp of God<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (Mishlei 20:27) Therefore Rashi explains here that it refers to the container, because the word “lamp” can also pertain to the container.<QC>
@p1[10]@p2<TIE>Sack.@bo A large sack in which one places merchandise; because it is written “@ITinto@it the covering,” it is clear that it has an inside. @p1[12]@p2<TIE>Inside the Mishkon which is holy.@bo Rashi is answering the question: It simply should have stated “with which they serve.” Why did it add “@hh<HEB>בקדש@ee<ENG> — in the sanctuary” (lit. in the Holy)? He answers that it is written @hh<HEB>בקדש@ee<ENG> to teach that they would not serve on the altar with these utensils, but rather in the Mishkon. For they did not need utensils for the inner altar, since they would only burn incense on it. (@ITGur Aryeh@it) One is not to explain [the verse to mean] that they served there in holiness, because if this were so, the Torah should have vowelized the @ITbeis@it with a @ITshva @it(@hh<HEB>בְקדש@ee<ENG>). However, now that it was vowelized with a @ITpasach@it (@hh<HEB>בַקדש@ee<ENG>) it is implies a known “holy” (i.e. @ITthe@it holy) entity and this is the Mishkon, for it was the most known [holy entity]. @p1[13]@p2<TIE>They shall take the ashes.@bo Not that they should place the ashes there (as the word @hh<HEB>ודשנו@ee<ENG> might imply). @d1Like a lion.@bo Specifically at the time when they traveled the coals appeared like a lion, however when they camped it was not visible because of the fire of the pyre that was placed above it. At the time of departure they removed this fire and the coal was visible. @d1Vessel.@bo At the end of Perek HaMotzi Tefillin (Eiruvin 104b), Rashi explains that a @hh<HEB>פסכתר@ee<ENG> was a copper pot. The word @hh<HEB>סירות@ee<ENG> (Shemos 27:3) — “pots” is translated by the Targum as @hh<HEB>פסכתרות@ee<ENG>. @p1[15]@p2<TIE>The Menorah and the service vessels.@bo (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) This raises a difficulty: Previously (v. 4) Rashi explained that the Holy of Holies referred to the Ark, the Table, the Menorah, the Paroches, and the service vessels, but here he does not mention the Table and the Altars. After I wrote this I found in the Midrash Rabbah “and the holy utensils” — these are the Table and the Menorah and the two Altars and their utensils. @d1Since, if they touch they will be subject.@bo Not that if they do not touch they will die, as is implied by the simple reading of the verse. The word @hh<HEB>ימותו@ee<ENG> “and they will die” is not together with the words @hh<HEB>ולא יגעו@ee<ENG>— “they shall not touch,” only with the word @hh<HEB>יגעו@ee<ENG> “touch.” Thus we are to infer “they shall not touch,” but if they do touch, then @hh<HEB>ימותו@ee<ENG> “they will die.” @p1[16]@p2<TIE>To carry .<TIE>.<TIE>. and to offer.@bo You might ask: Doesn’t the written verse implies “to @ITcarry@it them” (rather than to @IToffer@it)? The answer is that he means that Elazar was assigned “to carry them — the oil, incense and anointing oil.” However for the continual meal-offering it was his responsibility [to issue orders.<TIE>.<TIE>.]. Even though the word “to carry” appears to refer to all of them, even to the meal-offering, it is impossible to say this. The meal-offering was flour that was offered with a sacrifice — an @ITissaron@it for the sheep — and the flour was only termed a meal-offering at the time when it was brought together with the offering. This was only at the time of camping for then they would offer, but not at the time of traveling. Furthermore one cannot say that Rashi refers to the setting aside of flour or its sanctification in a utensil, because if so it would have become invalid after leaving the courtyard of the Mishkon. Also why would they set it aside earlier, since a mitzvah is most dear at its allotted time? Thus, it is impossible to say that they carried it at the time of traveling. Consequently Rashi explains that Elazar was responsible to issue orders, and with this Ramban’s question on Rashi’s explanation is rejected. @d1To issue orders for everyone.@bo Meaning that he would not carry them himself like the oil for illumination and the other items, because the Torah had already written above (v. 15) “and after that, the sons of Kehos shall come to carry [these items].” Rashi adds that he oversaw the load of Kehos, so that one does not err and say that the loads of Gershon and Merrori were also the responsibility of Elazar — given that the Torah here writes “the entire Mishkon.” However this is not the case because the loads of Gershon and Merrori were the responsibility of Isamar. Thus Rashi explains that Elazar was assigned to the load of Kehos. @p1[18]@p2<TIE>Do not cause.@bo Rashi thus informs us that the word @hh<HEB>תכריתו@ee<ENG> — “cut off” is from the causative @hh<HEB>הפעיל@ee<ENG> construct and it refers to the third person. @p1[20]@p2<TIE>Its “@HB<HEB>בלוע@ee@BO<ENG>” refers to the covering of it.@bo Similarly the Targum translates @hh<HEB>כד מכסן ית מני קודשא@ee<ENG> — “when the holy vessels are covered.”<QC>





@p1[22]@p2<TIE>Just as I commanded you.@bo Rashi stated “just as I @ITcommanded@it you concerning the sons of Kehos” rather than “just as you @ITcounted@it the sons of Kehos” because he had not yet counted them. Hashem had commanded Moshe to count them, previously in Parshas Bamidbar (4:2), and the act of doing so is recorded in this Parshah. Therefore Rashi writes “just as I @ITcommanded@it you concerning the sons of Kehos,” meaning that I am also commanding you to do the same for the sons of Gershon. Consequently the word @hh<HEB>גם@ee<ENG> (also) is connected to the phrase “according to the house of their fathers, according to their families.” Alternatively, one may say that Rashi was answering the question: The Torah should have stated “@hh<HEB>גם אותם@ee<ENG> (also them)” because the word @hh<HEB>הם@ee<ENG> is normally used as a subject, for example @hh<HEB>הם ילכו@ee<ENG> (they shall go), @hh<HEB>הם ישרתו@ee<ENG> (they shall serve). However the word @hh<HEB>הם@ee<ENG> is not used [when referring to an object] as with the word @hh<HEB>נשא@ee<ENG> (count), rather [the word] @hh<HEB>אותם@ee<ENG> is used. Therefore Rashi explains “just as I commanded you<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” and @hh<HEB>אותם@ee<ENG> is not used with these two words—that are either in the active @hh<HEB>פועל@ee<ENG> or in the passive @hh<HEB>נפעל@ee<ENG> constructs. @d1Have reached [the working] category.@bo Rashi did not state “just as I commanded you concerning the sons of Kehos @ITto count them@it” because he was answering the question: Why didn’t the Torah write “also count the sons of Gershon according to the house of their fathers<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” such that there would have been no need to write @hh<HEB>הם@ee<ENG> (them). He answers that if it had written “also count<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” this would have implied that you should also take their count from twenty-five years and above, or alternatively from one month and above. Therefore it wrote @hh<HEB>גם@ee<ENG> (also) at the end of this phrase to indicate that @hh<HEB>גם@ee<ENG> does not refer to the count mentioned previously, rather to the phrase “from thirty years<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” below (v. 23). This is why Rashi stated “[how many] have reached the working category,” which lasts from the age of thirty until fifty. @p1[25]@p2<TIE>The ten lower ones.@bo @ITRe’m@it explains that Rashi knew this because the Torah afterwards writes “and [of] the @hh<HEB>אהל@ee<ENG> (Tent) of Meeting,” which refers to the eleven goat-hair tapestries. They were termed an @hh<HEB>אהל@ee<ENG> when the Torah wrote “and make goat-hair tapestries @hh<HEB>לאהל@ee<ENG> (to cover)” (Shemos 26:7). @d1Goat-hair tapestries.@bo I explained all of this is Parshas Veyakhel (Shemos 35:11). @d1Red dyed.@bo As if the Torah had said @hh<HEB>ומכסהו@ee<ENG> (@ITand@it its covering) however it omitted the @ITvav@it; there are many examples like this. If one did not say this, why would the Torah have mentioned the tachash skins alone without the cover of the ram skins? @d1The eastern curtain.@bo This was already explained in Parshas Bamidbar (3:25). When Rashi writes “the eastern [curtain]” this does distinguish it, because there was no other curtain at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting aside from the eastern one. Thus this is only an embellishment of the explanation. @ITGur Aryeh@it explains that Rashi means to exclude the half curtain that was folded over in front of the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, to the east, as mentioned previously in Parshas Terumah (Shemos 26:9). It was joined to the other curtains and it did not have a distinct identity in of itself. @p1[26]@p2<TIE>Guard over the Mishkon.@bo Rashi is answering the question: The hanging tapestries were like walls around the courtyard; thus the term “@hh<HEB>על@ee<ENG> (lit. above) the Mishkon” is not appropriate, because “above the Mishkon” implies that they were above — on top of the Mishkon. He answers that it means that they protect and guard over the Mishkon. As if to say that one has to “add” a word such that it reads “which @ITprotect@it over the Mishkon.” It would be acceptable language to say that it guarded over the Mishkon and that it guarded over it on all sides. There are those who ask: Why didn’t Rashi explain this above in Parshas Bamidbar when it wrote “the hanging tapestries of the courtyard and the screen at the entrance of the courtyard which is @ITover@it the Mishkon and the Altar on all sides<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (3:26)? He did not say anything there. [We may explain this] with the comment of @ITRe’m@it at the beginning of Parshas Beha’aloscha regarding the lighting of the Ner Tamid — that in Parshas Emor Rashi did not give any explanation. There he writes that sometimes a commentator will explain all of the matters that apply to a certain term, sometimes only some of them and sometimes he relies on what he explains elsewhere, not explaining anything there. It appears to me that Rashi was forced to explain this here, even though it is obvious, because the verse wrote “and the screen for the entrance to the gate of the courtyard<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” This raises a difficulty: Why did the Torah use this repetitive language — stating both “entrance” and “gate”. Furthermore one may raise a difficulty with the pause between the word “entrance” and the word “gate”. This could cause one to err and explain the verse as if it had said “and the screen for the entrance and the screen for the gate of the courtyard.” Thus one would explain that the screen for the entrance of the courtyard was the eastern gate of the courtyard while the screen for the gate was the screen for the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. This [latter] is also termed “the gate of the courtyard” since it opened into the courtyard of the Mishkon. Accordingly the Torah said “which are over the Mishkon” meaning the gate of the courtyard that is @ITclose to@it the Mishkon and to the Altar. The word @hh<HEB>על@ee<ENG> (over) would thus be understood as a term of closeness. When the Torah previously wrote “and the screen for the entrance of the Tent of Meeting” this would have meant the Paroches that is in front of the Holy of Holies, being termed the “entrance to the Tent of Meeting” because it stands inside the Tent of Meeting. Thus one would have thought to say that the Paroches in front of the Holy of Holies was also part of the load of the sons of Gershon. However, this was not true because the Paroches screen was part of the load of the sons of Kehos, as is written above in Parshas Bamidbar (4:5) “Aharon [and his sons] shall enter .<TIE>.<TIE>. and take down the Paroches screen and with it they shall cover the Ark of the Testimony.” Therefore Rashi explains that “which are over the Mishkon” refers to the hanging tapestries etc. that protect and guard over the Mishkon. @d1The copper altar.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Since the hanging tapestries protected the Mishkon it is obvious that they were all around the altar that was inside the Mishkon. Furthermore, the beams of the Mishkon would guard over the golden altar. He answers that the verse does not refer to the Golden Altar that was in the Mishkon, rather to the copper altar that was outside the Mishkon.<QC>
@d1All that will be given.@bo Meaning that this does not refer to the parts just mentioned, because there were no other vessels needed for their service. Furthermore, neither the term “giving” nor the term “making” would be applicable to them. Rather the term “giving” refers to the sons of Gershon. Furthermore, if it referred to parts, the Torah should have written “that will be made to them for their service.” Therefore Rashi brought the translation of the Targum which explains that @hh<HEB>יעשה@ee<ENG> (lit. will be made) is a term of giving and the word “to them” refers to the sons of Gershon who were mentioned above. This teaches that everything mentioned in this passage was given over into their hands. @p1[27]@p2<TIE>Appointed over them.@bo Rashi is answering the question: The verses contradict each other, because here it says “by the instruction of Aharon and his sons” and afterwards it writes (v.28) “under the supervision of Isamar son of Aharon the Kohein.” He answers that the second verse explains the previous one — which of his sons was appointed over them? [the second verse] explains that it was Isamar son of Aharon. You might ask: Since only Isamar was appointed, why did it write @hh<HEB>ובניו@ee<ENG> (lit. and his sons) in the plural. However this is not a question because in many places we see the plural used for a single son, for example “@hh<HEB>ובני@ee<ENG> (lit. and the sons) of Don is Chushim” (Bereishis 46:23) and “@hh<HEB>ובני@ee<ENG> (lit. and the sons) of Palu is Eliav” (Bamidbar 26:8). @p1[32]@p2<TIE>And ropes for the pillars.@bo With this Rashi explains how both [Gershon and Merori] had stakes and ropes. You might ask: Previously in Parshas Bamidbar (3:26) Rashi explained [that Gershon’s load was] the ropes of the Mishkon and the Tent @ITbut not@it of the courtyard. If so how can he explain that the sons of Gershon also carried the ropes of the courtyard? The answer is: When Rashi said previously “but not of the courtyard” he meant that the ropes of the Mishkon were all in the load of the sons of Gershon. However the ropes of the courtyard were not all in their load, rather some were in the load of the sons of Gershon and some in the load of the sons of Merori, as he explains here. @d1By their upper border.@bo @ITRe’m@it explains that stakes were connected to the pillars. They were made like rods called @ITfalush@it,@IT@it which are stakes six tefachim long and three tefachim wide with a copper ring in the middle. One would wrap the border of the curtain around it with the ropes in a position next to each pillar, and hang the rod with the ring on hooks that were on the pillar, made in the shape of the letter @ITvav@it with one side bent upwards and the other inserted into the pillar. @d1And rods.@bo In Parshas Terumah (Shemos 27:10) this is explained fully. @p1[47]@p2<TIE>Service for [another] service.@bo Meaning that at the time when the Kohanim were making offerings and dealing with the service, the Levites were singing and playing on their cymbals and harps. Thus they performed a service for the service of the Kohanim. @d1As the phrase indicates.@bo Meaning that even though “the service of the service” is explained as “the service @ITfor@it a service,” nonetheless the “the service of carrying” is not explained as the service @ITfor@it carrying, rather as the phrase indicates it means “the service that is carrying.” (R. Hendel) @p1[49]@p2<TIE>From the ages of thirty to fifty.@bo The opinion of Rashi is that the word @hh<HEB>ופקודיו@ee<ENG> (and they were counted) refers to Moshe, as the verse wrote previously “he counted them, by the hand of Moshe.” The words “@hh<HEB>אשר@ee<ENG> (that) [Hashem] commanded” are thus understood as “@hh<HEB>כאשר@ee<ENG> (as) [Hashem] commanded.” Consequently the verse is saying “the counting of Moshe as Hashem commanded Moshe,” meaning from the ages of thirty to fifty. This is why Rashi said “those counted were, as commanded, from the ages of thirty to fifty.” Do not ask why it writes Moshe’s name twice, instead of writing “him,” even though it refers to Moshe earlier in the verse. The answer is that many verses speak in this way, for example “He said to Moshe: come up to Hashem” (Shemos 24:1) where it could have said “come up to Me.” Similarly “Hashem rained down sulfur and fire upon Sodom and upon Ammorah, and the fire came from Hashem” (Bereishis 19:24) where it could have said “from Him.” Similarly “Lemech said to his wives Adah and Tzilah: Hear my voice, wives of Lemech” (Bereishis 4:23) where he could have said “my wives.” One might ask: Why did Rashi need to explain this — doesn’t the Torah state “from the ages of thirty<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” many times? The answer is: Because it wrote (v.48) “Their numbers were eight thousand five hundred and eighty” and afterwards said “according to the word of Hashem he counted them,” you might want to explain that this refers to another count that was made in Parshas Beha’aloscha, which was from the age of twenty-five. Therefore Rashi explains that “those counted<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” His proof is from the fact that it writes “as Hashem commanded Moshe” implying that they had already been commanded about this, however the command to count from the age of twenty-five was only said later. There are those who explain that @hh<HEB>ופקודיו@ee<ENG> means “and they were appointed” and that Rashi explains “@hh<HEB>ואותם הפקודים@ee<TIE><ENG>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” meaning that those appointed — Elazar and Isamar who were appointed over them — must also be between the ages of thirty and fifty. I found this explanation in the name of a certain great scholar.<QC>
@p1[2]@p2<TIE>This Parshah was said on the day.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Why didn’t he command them this Parshah immediately after the Mishkon was erected? Surely they arranged the camps on the day that the Mishkon was erected, and immediately afterwards he should have commanded them to send everyone who was impure out of the camp. He answers that it was indeed said on the day that the Mishkon was erected. Rashi is also answering another question: Where do we find that that any other Parshah was said to them on the day that the Mishkon was erected? He answers that “eight parshiyos<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @d1Three camps.@bo Because it wrote the word “camp” three times in this Parshah. @d1Out of all of them.@bo Regarding the metzoro the Torah writes “he shall dwell alone” (Vayikra 13:46) implying that he should dwell in a place where no other impure people go, i.e. outside the three camps. When the Torah wrote “and they shall not defile their camps,” (v.3) rather than writing “their camp” this implies that there was one camp for a zav and another camp for a person defiled by the dead. Now, since one defiled by the dead is permitted in the Levite camp, as explained previously, one may infer that a zav is permitted in the Israelite camp. @d1From the encampment of the Shechinah.@bo You might ask: From where did Rashi know this? The answer is that the fact that one defiled by the dead is even permitted in the Levite camp is learned from Moshe Rabbeinu who was himself a Levi. The Torah writes “Moshe took the bones of Yosef with him” (Shemos 13:19) and he entered the camp of the Levites. @d1Means .<TIE>.<TIE>. bones.@bo Meaning that the opinion of the Targum is that they were defiled through the bone of a corpse. @ITRe’m@it explains Rashi’s proof: Had this been a term meaning impurity, a person who touched someone who became impure from a corpse would have also been rendered an @ITav hatumoh@it (‘father’ i.e. originator of impurity) since [the verse would mean that] a person who touched someone who became impure from a corpse is commanded here to be sent out of the camp like a zav or a metzoro, which are both @ITavos hatumoh@it. However this is not so, because a person who touches someone who became impure through touching a corpse only becomes a @ITvlad hatumoh@it (‘offspring’ of impurity). Thus one is forced to say that “defiled by a [departed] soul” refers to bones. A bone is an @ITavi avos hatumoh@it (‘father of a father’ of impurity) and one who touches it becomes an @ITav hatumoh@it. You might ask: How did Rashi know this, perhaps the verse means that he was rendered impure by flesh rather than a bone. An answer is that if this was so the Torah should have written @hh<HEB>טמא בנפש@ee<ENG> (defiled @ITby@it a soul), but what is meant by @hh<HEB>טמא לנפש@ee<ENG> (lit. defiled @ITto@it a soul) — this implies that he was rendered impure by something connected to the soul — and this is the bones. Another answer is that it was because the Targum translates @hh<HEB>דמסאב לטמי נפשא@ee<ENG> (who were defiled by the bones of a soul) whereas he should have merely translated it as @hh<HEB>דמסאב נפשא@ee<ENG> (defiled by a soul). However the additional word @hh<HEB>לטמי@ee<ENG> implies bones.<QC>
@p1[7]@p2<TIE>This is the principal [payment] concerning which he took the oath.@bo This was the value originally payable, thus Rashi explains: What is termed the principle? — The money concerning which he took the oath. This means to say that it is the money concerning which he took an oath, and not the additional fifth. @d1To whom he is liable.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Why didn’t the Torah write “from whom he stole” instead of “to whom he is indebted”? This implies that [one returns the money] to the one to whom the principle belongs. For example, if someone lent money to the person who was robbed, and this [thief] came and stole it from him, he is obliged to give it to the lender who lent it to the person who he stole from. Thus Rashi stated “to the one to whom he is liable” to teach that one gives the money to the one to whom the victim of the theft is liable. @p1[8]@p2<TIE>When he recants.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Since the thief denied it and the one who caused him to swear has already died, how could it be that he now wished to pay? He answers that it is “when he recants<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @d1[This refers to] a proselyte who died without heirs.@bo You might ask: In Parshas Behar it writes “and a man who will not have a redeemer” (Vayikra 25:26). Rashi asks: Is there anyone in Yisroel who does not have a redeemer? He answers that it refers to a redeemer who can redeem him from his sale. Meaning that he certainly has a redeemer, however he does not have a wealthy redeemer who can redeem him from his sale. Why didn’t Rashi explain that it refers to a proselyte who died without heirs, as he answers here? The answer is that there it was not possible to say that it referred to a proselyte, because the Torah wrote “and he sold some of his holdings” meaning [land] that he inherited from his father. But a proselyte would not have an inheritance from his father. Here it was also not possible to answer as Rashi did there, because anyone would want to receive the debt — the principle and the additional fifth, whether poor or wealthy. @d1This is the principle.@bo The Torah did not write this previously when it said “But if the man has no redeemer to whom the debt may be returned,” omitting to write “[the debt] @ITbeing returned@it,” because it relied on what was written previously where the Torah stated “and return the principal amount of his guilt, and [add] one fifth<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (v.7). @d1Then gives it to the @BIkohein.@bo Because if this were not so, if it was for Hashem it could not be for the kohein, and vice-versa. Furthermore, one cannot say that it would be for both — the sacrificial parts for Hashem and the meat for the kohanim, because then the Torah should have said “to Hashem @ITand@it to the kohein.”<QC>
@d1In that watch. @boYou might ask: Perhaps he gives it to any kohein to whom he wishes, even if they are not in that watch. The answer is that since the Torah afterwards writes “besides the ram of forgiveness<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” this implies that this should be given to the kohein aside from the ram of forgiveness. The ram of forgiveness was given specifically to a kohein in that watch, as the Torah writes in Parshas Shoftim “portion by portion they shall eat<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (Devarim 18:9). Therefore the principle and the additional fifth should also only be given to a kohein from that watch. @d1Mentioned in Vayikra (5:25).@bo (@ITPaneach Raza@it) The term “besides” implies that the Torah obliges one to bring it, therefore Rashi had to say that this is the one mentioned in Vayikra. Furthermore he had to mention this here, because one might think that when one returns stolen property to its owners, one requires an offering to atone for the heavenly judgment; however when one gives it to a kohein this itself is an atonement. Thus Rashi lets us know that this is not so. @p1[9]@p2<TIE>But one does not know.@bo (@ITBa’al Hamesader@it) A question is asked upon Rashi’s explanation: “Do we not know what must be done with them?” Surely there is an explicit verse in Parshas Korach “the bikurim of all that is in their land, which they bring before Hashem, shall be yours” (Bamidbar 18:13)! The answer is that in Parshas Mishpotim (Shemos 23:19) the mitzvah of bringing bikurim is listed as one of the six hundred and thirteen mitzvos, but Parshas Ki Savo (Devarim 26:1-11) only lists the mitzvah of recitation over the bikurim that is stated in that Parshah. In Parshas Korach Rashi explains on the verse “I have given [you the guarding of my trumah-gifts]” (18:8) that there is “a comparison to a King<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” consequently “I have given” means “that I have already given”; thus “shall be yours” (18:13) also means [that the bikurim] have already been given. However, we do not find in the entire Torah that the kohanim were given the bikurim like they were given the other twenty-three gifts. Therefore Rashi here needed to explain as he did and switch the word terumah for the word bikurim, using the force of Rabbi Yishmael’s question. @p1[10]@p2<TIE>Informing us that the executory benefits belong to the owner.@bo Meaning that he can give them to any kohein to whom he wishes; this is termed @hh<HEB>טובת הנאה@ee<ENG> (executory benefits). Accordingly one may take a selah or more from an Israelite in order to give the produce to his daughter’s son who is a kohein, however one may not take money from a kohein in order to give the kohein these gifts. The Torah wrote “shall be his” meaning that the executory benefits belong to the owners.<QC>
@p1[12]@p2<TIE>What is written [immediately] above this subject?@bo Normally Rashi only makes inferences from juxtapositions when matters are not written in their normal place, because then they were certainly written so for one to make an inference. Nonetheless, since there is no comparison between the laws of marriage and those of terumah and sanctified property, it is certain that they were only juxtaposed in order for one to make an inference. (@ITGur Aryeh@it) explains that [Rashi’s inference] is not from the juxtaposition of the passages, because if this were so he should have said “why was the Parshah of the sotah juxtaposed to that of sacred property,” as is his normal style. Rather, Rashi was answering the question: The Parshah should not have begun with the man, rather with the woman — saying “a woman who goes astray and acts treacherously<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” given that she was the source of the sin. Therefore he explains “what is written above<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” meaning that @IThe@it was the source of the sin and “any man” refers to the passage above. See there. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) The matter is puzzling — ‘Tuviah sinned and Zeigud was punished?’ So too here — the husband sinned because he withheld the gifts to the kohanim and the woman was disgraced such that she had to come before the kohein! All the more so if she literally became defiled, it is difficult to understand how the sin of the husband could cause the sin of the wife. Rather, this is the correct explanation: The woman certainly has sins of her own and her sins caused the sin of promiscuity. Nonetheless if it were not for the combination of the sin of the husband with her sin of promiscuity, her sin would certainly have caused it to become publicized without the warning and seclusion. Thus the Beis Din would have killed her without causing disgrace to the husband, obliging him to bring her before the kohein and cause her to drink in order for her to die through the lethal waters. Instead, the combination with the sin of the husband caused there to be witnesses to the seclusion rather than witnesses to the defilement, and he had to bring her to the kohein in order to cause her to drink. Likewise, if she were to come away exonerated from the charge of promiscuity, had it not been for the combination with the husband’s sin, the sin of the wife would have lead to a simple rumor, without witnesses to her seclusion. Alternatively, there would have been only one witness to her defilement or she would have said that she would not drink — and in all of these cases one would not cause her to drink. Rather, here the combination with the sin of the husband caused him to have to bring her to the kohein in order to cause her to drink. (@ITGur Aryeh@it) [One may ask:] It appears that this is not specific to the case of a sotah, because had he been a zav or metzora he would also have needed a kohein, given that they too require a kohein. For if one did not say so, why should sotah be different? One may answer that the cases of a zav or metzora are different. If he wanted to be a sinner and not bring an atonement, who would know? Thus he would not necessarily need a kohein. However with a sotah, even a sinner would not wish his wife to be promiscuous, since it is the nature of people for this to be detestable, as the Torah writes “and he was jealous.” And since he was jealous, he would certainly bring her before the kohein. When one appreciates this matter further, one will see that it is measure for measure. Since he did not wish to give the gifts to the kohein, asking why he should give his money to the kohein, the Torah said “By your life you will need him.” You shall know the greatness of the kohein — that he is the intermediary between Hashem and Yisroel, making peace between them through the offerings. Yisroel are called Hashem’s wife as it writes, “If you do not know, most beautiful of women” (Shir Hashirim 1:8) and in many other places where they are termed a wife. Therefore this man will now require a kohein to whom he will bring the sotah, in order that he can also make peace between him and his wife. She strayed from him and the kohein would make peace between them. Surely this is exactly the same as when a kohein makes peace between Yisroel and their Father in Heaven, causing the Divine Presence to rest in the world. Similarly Rashi explains in Parshas Masei (Bamidbar 35:25) that Hashem is called a husband to Yisroel (see @ITGur Aryeh@it there). This man was one of them but he did not wish to recognize the greatness of the kohein, therefore he had to bring the sotah to the kohein in order to make peace between himself and his wife. @d1Spirit of foolishness.@bo Meaning that their evil inclination would tell them that it was permitted - and this is the foolishness. If one did not say so then why would she be liable for death, given that it was due to foolishness? @d1Turns aside from the ways of modesty.@bo Rashi specifically said “from the ways of modesty” and not “from the ways of the Torah,” because if it was from the ways of the Torah this would imply that she certainly was promiscuous, and if it was certain that she was promiscuous then we do not give her [the waters] to drink. Therefore he stated “from the ways of modesty,” meaning that she was seen embracing or kissing another man and there was a suspicion that she had been promiscuous. @d1What is the treachery.@bo Rashi is answering the question: The words “acts treacherously toward him. And a man has lain [with her]” imply that there are two matters. Thus Rashi explains “What is the treachery? [A man] lay.<TIE>.<TIE>.,” as if it had written @ITthat@it a man lay with her. However this does not mean that a man really lay with her, because if this were so we not give her the waters to drink. Consequently the sequence of events in the passage is as follows: When she goes astray and turns away from the ways of modesty, and a spirit of jealousy comes upon him and he is jealous of his wife; If afterwards she is concealed long enough to have been defiled, then whether she acted treacherously towards him, for a man to lay with her conjugally and it was hidden from him, or whether a man did not lay with her and she was not defiled, rather he was only jealous of her even though she did not act, then the man shall bring his wife .<TIE>.<TIE>. (@ITRe’m@it). @p1[13]@p2<TIE>Lying with her.@bo Rashi’s text read “And a man has lain with her conjugally. Lying with her disqualifies her but lying with her sister does not disqualify her @ITfrom her husband@it (Yevamos 95).” Meaning that if her husband lay with her sister, she is not disqualified to her husband due to her sister’s promiscuity. For one might have said that she was disqualified due to a kal vachomer (a fortiori reasoning): Just as when one has relations with a ‘lesser’ prohibition, the one who causes the prohibition becomes forbidden — in a case where one has relations with a ‘stricter’ prohibition, the one who causes the prohibition should certainly be forbidden. Rashi explains that the ‘lesser’ prohibition is that of a married woman who can become permitted to others through divorce. [The kal vachomer is as follows]: If the wife was promiscuous, she becomes forbidden to her husband, which means she is forbidden to the entire world. Thus, in a case where he had relations with a ‘strict’ prohibition, such as the sister of his wife who is prohibited to him through by his marriage to his wife all the time that she is alive. Is it not logical that the one who ‘caused’ this prohibition should be prohibited — his wife should be prohibited to her husband, since she ‘caused’ the prohibition of her sister to her husband? Therefore the Torah said “with her” to teach that “lying with her disqualifies her<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (Yevamos 95a). However, a mistake occurred in the Rashi texts. I heard this from Rabbi Yitzchak Cohen z’l. I have found written that the comment, “incident of the two sisters<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” should have been placed on the verse “if any man” (v. 12) where Rashi explained that she is doubly treacherous — against the “Man” in Heaven, and the man on earth. There the Midrash teaches: Against the “Man” on High and the man below — Hashem says to her “You are fooling your husband, perhaps you think that you can fool me” — there was an incident of two sisters .<TIE>.<TIE>. @d1This excludes a blind man.@bo Meaning that there are two matters here and both are excluded by the verse. From the word @hh<HEB>מעיני@ee<ENG> (from [his] eyes) we exclude a blind man, who, even if it is known that she was promiscuous, does not cause her to drink given that he cannot see. While from the word @hh<HEB>נעלם@ee<ENG> (hidden) we infer that if he saw the two of them, but feigned ignorance that both of them were together, the waters do not examine her. The word @hh<HEB>מעמעם@ee<ENG> (feigned ignorance) is understood as in @hh<HEB>גחלים עממות@ee<ENG> (dimmed coals) which the Targum uses to translate the word “dim” (Vayikra 13:6). @d1Long enough.@bo Meaning that the words “and she has been defiled” that are written after “and she was concealed” refer to a time long enough to have been defiled. This is the time that it takes to roast an egg and swallow it. Because if you were to think that it means that she was actually defiled, surely the Torah previously wrote “and a man has laid with her” which referred to defilement. Therefore I would not need the Torah to write the words “and she has been defiled”? Rather they must have come to teach that she was concealed long enough to have been defiled. @d1Even one witness.@bo You might ask: From where does this inference come — is it because the Torah wrote “and there is no @hh<HEB>עד@ee<ENG> (witness) against her”. Surely we have established that wherever the Torah says @hh<HEB>עד@ee<ENG> (lit. witness in the @ITsingular@it) it refers to two. This is because it had to specify “@ITone@it @hh<HEB>עד@ee<ENG> (witness) shall not arise” (Devarim 19:15) which implies that every @hh<HEB>עד@ee<ENG> written in the Torah refers to two, unless the Torah specifies that it is one, as Rashi explains in Parshas Shoftim (ad loc.). If so, here where it writes @hh<HEB>עד@ee<ENG> alone, this would imply that there are not two witnesses against her but there @ITis@it one against her (and in such a circumstance one would cause her to drink the bitter waters). The answer is that the words “and there is no witness against her” refer to the words “and she was not seized forcibly” and not to “and he is jealous of his wife .<TIE>.<TIE>. that man shall bring his wife to the kohein” to cause her to drink (v. 14-15). Meaning that if there is no witness against her that she was not seized forcibly, i.e. there were not two witnesses to defilement, though there @ITwas@it one witness who saw that she was defiled — one would not cause her to drink, but she would be forbidden to her husband (Sotah 2a). Thus the word @hh<HEB>הא@ee<ENG> (but) in Rashi is like @hh<HEB>והא למדת@ee<ENG> (you have learned) and does not imply an inference, only a conclusion “you have learned this, but if there was [even one witness]<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Furthermore, Rashi was answering the question: Why is one witness believed to prohibit her to her husband? He answers that “there is no witness against her” to the defilement but there are witnesses to the concealment. Since there are two witnesses to the concealment who say that they saw that she was concealed with a certain person long enough for defilement, and there is one witness against her who say that she was defiled, this is enough circumstantial evidence to believe that she was certainly promiscuous. Thus the Torah writes “and there is no witness against her” here to teach you that it refers to the word @hh<HEB>נטמאה@ee<ENG> (and she had become defiled) above. Meaning that when there are [two] witnesses to concealment then one witness [to defilement] is believed. However, had it not been written here then I would not know that there were witnesses to the concealment. @d1Ravished.@bo The verse is saying as follows: “And there is no witness against her” — meaning that there are not two [witnesses] against her @ITbut there is@it one, “and she was not seized forcibly” - rather he testifies that she did so willingly. In such a case she is forbidden to her husband. Thus it is a separate law on its own. @p1[14]@p2<TIE>Before.@bo This implies that the verses are not in order as explained above (on v. 12). @d1It is not known.@bo Meaning that he neither know she was defiled nor know that she was not defiled as implied by the straightforward understanding of the words “and she was defiled .<TIE>.<TIE>. and she was not defiled”. Because the Torah writes “but it was hidden from her husband’s eyes” and the Rabbis learn that that if he saw that she was defiled then the waters do not examine her. @p1[15]@p2<TIE>But not of fine flour.@bo @ITRe’m@it writes that Rashi is informing us of the reason why the Torah excludes fine flour and wheat. For one cannot explain he means to inform us that the words “flour” and “barley” in the verse are there to exclude fine flour and wheat, given that this is obvious. It is something that any schoolchild knows. @d1Identified as light.@bo Meaning that oil is termed @hh<HEB>יצהר@ee<ENG>, as the verse writes “Your grain, your wine, @hh<HEB>יצהרך@ee<ENG> (your oil)” (Devarim 7:13). This is the same as the terms @hh<HEB>צוהר@ee<ENG> (skylight) and @hh<HEB>צהרים@ee<ENG> (noon) which refer to light. @p1[18]@p2<TIE>But, they moved.@bo @hh<HEB>מסיעין@ee<ENG> (they moved) in the sense of transferring. @d1He disentangles.@bo This implies that @hh<HEB>פרע@ee<ENG> (disentangle) is a term of demolishing. You might ask: Rashi always explains the word @hh<HEB>פרע@ee<ENG> when used regarding the head as a term of growth. This was evident above in Parshas Emor (Vayikra 21:11) where he said that @hh<HEB>לא יפרע@ee<ENG> means “you shall not grow,” and below regarding the Nazir. The answer is that here it is also a term of growth, because when the hair is plaited it is shorter, and when one disentangles the plaits it ‘becomes’ longer. Thus it emerges that the disentangling causes the hair to ‘grow’. @ITRe’m@it writes that though @hh<HEB>פרע@ee<ENG> is normally a term of exposing, as Rashi himself writes on the verse “for they were @hh<HEB>פרוע@ee<ENG> (exposed)” (Shemos 32:25) where he says that that this means exposed .<TIE>.<TIE>. as with “and expose the woman’s hair,” this is not a contradiction to his explanation that he disentangles the plaits of her hair. For Rashi’s explanation here is not inferred from the word @hh<HEB>פרע@ee<ENG>, rather from the superfluous word “the woman”. The Torah should have written “and expose @ITher@it hair” since it refers to the woman mentioned previously. Thus “the woman” was added to allude to her whole body, teaching that one disentangles her hair revealing her heart and compounding her disgrace. It appears possible to me to say that by way of the disentangling one reveals how the hair appeared long before it was shortened. @d1Debasing.@bo The reason that I found is a parable of a person who committed a sin. He went out to the market place and was embarrassed, so he covered his head and his face. Likewise one uncovers the hair of a woman who transgressed the command. @d1At the Nikanor Gate.@bo He [Nikanor] was a virtuous person who brought copper doors for this gate from Alexandria in Egypt. In doing so Hashem performed many miracles, as is taught in Maseches Yoma 37b. Some say in the name of @ITMaharam@it: Why Rashi did explain this out of order, after “and expose the woman’s head.” Furthermore, upon the words “before Hashem” (v.16) above he did not explain anything. The answer is that there it would be possible to explain “before Hashem” as referring to the sanctuary. However here, Rashi explains that he disentangles the plaits in her hair in order to humiliate her, in accordance with the teaching of the Rabbis that there were many actions through which she was humiliated. It would not be proper to do so in the sanctuary, therefore one is forced to say that it was at the gate of Nikanor. @d1To exhaust her.@bo One cannot say that this was for waving, as previously in the verse “upon the palms of Aharon and upon the palms of his sons” (Shemos 29:24) in the context of the inauguration. There the Torah continues, “and shall wave,” while here it begins with causing her to drink the bitter waters and the oaths of accursedness. Only afterwards does it write “and shall wave” (v.25). Therefore one is forced to say that it was in order to exhaust her etc.<QC>
@d1So that the Sacred Name not be erased.@bo [@ITR. Hendil@it] Rashi did not explain this above when he also wrote that they acted to exhaust her (s.v. “The Kohein shall station”). The reason is that there he was commanded to exhaust her so that she would not drink and die. The Torah took pity on her since there were neither witnesses nor warning of her defilement. However here it is not possible to say this because there is no reason to be concerned about her to this extent, since she turned aside from the ways of modesty and transgressed the warning to conceal herself. Rather, here Hashem was concerned for the honor of His name. @d1Because of their aftermath.@bo Thus @hh<HEB>מי המרים@ee<ENG> means “the bitter waters” while @hh<HEB>המאררים למרים@ee<ENG> (v. 24) means “[they shall enter her] to become bitter and lethal” becoming bitter and destructive in her mouth. (@ITGur Aryeh@it) If this were not so why would they be bitter? Though the Gemara says that they would place a bitter grass in them, because the Torah writes @hh<HEB>המרים@ee<ENG> (the bitter [waters]), nonetheless the word @hh<HEB>המרים@ee<ENG> with a @IThei@it denoting the definite article (@ITthe@it bitter [waters]) implies that it was for this that they were known. We do not explicitly find anywhere [in the Torah] that they would place a bitter substance in them. Therefore Rashi says that they were termed bitter because of their aftermath. @p1[19]@p2<TIE>If no [man] laid.@bo Meaning that one should not say that he adjures her by the Holy Name, like all other oaths where we explain that one swears with the Holy Name. @ITRe’m@it explains: This is so that one should not say that the statement is one matter and the oath is another. If no [man] laid, @hh<HEB>הנקי@ee<ENG> (be absolved); but if he laid, @hh<HEB>לא תנקי@ee<ENG> (do not absolved). There are texts that read “but if he laid, @hh<HEB>חנקי@ee<ENG> (may you choke).” This is why the Torah wrote the word @hh<HEB>חנקי@ee<ENG> without a @ITyud@it (with a @ITchirik@it taking its place) in order to teach homiletically term @hh<HEB>חנק@ee<ENG> (strangulation) as if it had been written with the letter @IThei@it as part of the root [of the verb]. This is possible because the letters @IThei@it and @ITches@it are interchangeable and thus one can homiletically learn “may you choke” meaning that you shall die. @p1[20]@p2<TIE>In the sense of “if”.@bo Rashi is answering the question: The word @hh<HEB>כי@ee<ENG> (which would have been translated here as ‘since’) implies that she had certainly been promiscuous, and if she had certainly been promiscuous then one would not cause her to drink. @p1[21]@p2<TIE>The way.@bo Meaning “if what I said is not true may [disaster] happen to me…” For if this was not so, the Torah should have said “Hashem shall place @hh<HEB>אלה@ee<ENG> (a curse) in you”. Thus the lamed of the word @hh<HEB>לאלה@ee<ENG> is in place of the word “@ITfor@it” (the verse reading “Hashem shall make you @ITfor@it a curse), meaning that she shall be a tool for everyone who curses or makes an oath. @p1[22]@p2<TIE>For the curse.@bo Tosafos in the first chapter of Kiddushin (27b) explain that one could have easily derived “for the curse .<TIE>.<TIE>. for the oath .<TIE>.<TIE>. from this husband .<TIE>.<TIE>. from a different husband” from one Amein, since it refers to all that was said in this passage. The curse and the oath are written explicitly here, while the Torah also writes “while you were married to your husband” (v. 20) which implies both this husband and another husband. Thus the other Amein refers to women who were engaged or waiting for levirate marriage who are not mentioned in this passage, and Rashi has condensed his words. This raises a difficulty: If Rashi’s opinion was so, he should have said “Amein if from this husband, if from different husband; Amein for the curse and for the oath. However, Rashi elaborated where he should have been brief and said the word Amein twice — Amien for the curse and Amein for the oath — and similarly Amein if from this husband, Amein if from a different husband. Thus it is certain that Rashi here means to explain that these two Ameins are needed for what was mentioned, one for the curse and one for the oath, and similarly one Amein if from this husband and one if from a different husband. And there is no difficulty that there are only two Ameins here, for one may answer that one can derive two things from the one Amein. Rashi here did not want to explain [that it referred to] the cases of the betrothed woman etc., because they are not implied by the verse, only through oral tradition like most of the Oral Law. Rashi only explains the language of the Torah — and it should have written Amein @ITand@it Amein with a @ITvav@it if it was adding another case. (@ITR. Y. Triosh@it) @p1[24]@p2<TIE>He brought her offering.@bo As the Torah writes (v. 26) “…and burn it on the altar” and after that he shall cause the woman to drink the water”. @d1Since it says “abdomen” and “thigh”.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Wasn’t this was also written previously (v. 22) “these lethal bitter waters will enter .<TIE>.<TIE>. to swell the abdomen<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”? He answers “since it [merely] says<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @d1They will be [harmful and bitter] for her.@bo Not that the waters would enter there @ITtowards@it some bitter substance, for they were already in her stomach and there was no other bitter substance there.<QC>
@p1[25]@p2<TIE>Up and down.@bo I have explained this in Parshas Emor (Vayikra 23:11). @d1Above the hand.@bo We learn [a comparison] to the word “hand” from the Peace-offering where it writes “his hands shall bring it” (Vayikra 7:30). Just as there the owners wave the offering with the kohein, so too here she waves with the kohein. However, the verse also writes “the kohein shall take” thus how can both be true? Rather, the kohein waves and she also waves with him with her hands above the hands of the kohein. Furthermore, he learned this from the word “from the hand” meaning that the hand of the woman was above the hand of the kohein. For if this was not so the Torah should have written “the kohein shall take from the woman” — why was it necessary to say “from her @IThand@it”? @d1Before taking the handful.@bo Rashi is answering the question: The word @hh<HEB>והקריב@ee<ENG> (and bring it close - a term that normally denotes the bringing of an offering) implies that he offered the minchah. However afterwards (v. 26) it writes “the kohein will scoop out from the meal-offering,” implying that he had not yet scooped anything out. So how could the Torah write that he should offer the handful which had not yet been scooped out? Rashi answers that the word @hh<HEB>והקריב@ee<ENG> connotes placing, meaning that he placed the minchah on the southwest corner.<QC>
@p1[27]@p2<TIE>I will not drink.@bo Meaning that if she said “I will be divorced from him without collecting a kesubah, but I will not drink” then we do not listen to her, since the Holy Name has been erased. [We only do not give her to drink if] she says “I am defiled.” However before the Holy Name is erased, if she says “I will not drink, and I will be divorced without collecting a kesubah” then we listen to her and do not make her drink, even though she does not admit to being defiled. @d1We coerce.@bo Rashi explains in Perek @ITHayah Notel@it (Sotah 19b) that they would open her mouth against her will and pour the water down her gullet. The Aruch explains that this is an elongation of the root @hh<HEB>ער@ee<ENG> having the connotation of intoxication. @d1Tested her.@bo Even though in the curse itself the Torah writes “to swell the abdomen and collapse the thigh” (v. 22) with the stomach first and then the thigh, this does not refer to the abdomen and the thigh of the sotah, rather to the abdomen and the thigh of the adulterer. @d1Use her as a curse.@bo Even though Rashi explained previously that “everyone will swear through you” and “will curse through you” (v. 21), here it is not possible to explain so, because if this were so why would it have been necessary [for the Torah to repeat it]? @d1Among those who know her.@bo Because it is a greater embarrassment for her.<QC>
@p1[28]@p2<TIE>During this concealment.@bo It was unnecessary to say this, because the entire passage refers to a woman who was warned and concealed herself. Nonetheless Rashi was obliged to explain the words “and is pure” as meaning “from any other place” other than the man about whom she was warned and was concealed with. Thus he first explained that “if the woman was not defiled” refers to concealment with the man about whom she was warned. @d1Furthermore.@bo You should not say that “she will bear seed” is the continuation of “she will be cleansed,” which would mean that she will be cleansed and therefore she will bear seed or that she will be cleansed from the things that prevent her from childbearing and consequently she will bear seed. Rather Rashi explains that she will be cleansed from the lethal waters, referring to her being saved from the swelling of the abdomen and the collapse of the thigh. He then explains that “she shall bear seed” means that furthermore she shall bear [seed].<QC>
@p1[31]@p2<TIE>The sotah is forbidden.@bo Since the Torah had to write “the man is cleansed of sin,” meaning that she is permitted to him after drinking, this implies that before she drinks she is forbidden to her husband. @p1[2]@p2<TIE>That whoever observes a sotah.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Why was this not been placed next to the passage of Nedarim (vows), which is its fitting place? @ITRe’m@it explains that there is no association whatsoever to the passage of the sotah, for she transgressed [one of] the Ten Commandments while the Nazirite sanctified himself, abstaining from that which was permitted to him. Therefore Rashi asks why this passage was placed here, even though such a question is not normal for Rashi. @d1In her decadence.@bo Meaning how they degraded her, as it writes, “and expose her hair” (5:18). @p1[3]@p2<TIE>Wine intoxicates.@bo Meaning why is new wine called @hh<HEB>יין@ee<ENG> (wine) while old wine is called @hh<HEB>שכר@ee<ENG> (lit. intoxicating)? The answer is because it is [more] intoxicating. @d1Denotes adding color.@bo Meaning [the adding of color by] the soaking of something in water or any other liquid. Because for the term @hh<HEB>כיבוס@ee<ENG> (lit. washing) which refers to immersion [in a mikveh] the Targum translates with the word @hh<HEB>ויצבע@ee<ENG> (related to the word for coloring), as Rashi explains at the end of Parshas Tazriah (Vayikra 13:58). @p1[4]@p2<TIE>Like the tongue of a bell.@bo Meaning that according to Rashi @hh<HEB>זג@ee<ENG> (skin) is from the same derivation as @hh<HEB>זוג@ee<ENG> (bell).<QC>
@p1[5]@p2<TIE>[His] hair.@bo Meaning that the word “sacred” does not refer to his body, rather to his hair. Rashi’s proof is that the phrase preceding “he shall be sacred” refers to the hair as it writes “he shall not pass a razor over his head” and then the Torah writes “he shall be sacred.” Similarly the verse writes “he shall let the hair of his head grow long” which refers to the hair, and the word “sacred” is written in between, meaning that it apparently also refers to the hair. @d1For growing the growth.@bo Rashi needed to add the @ITlamed@it to the word @hh<HEB>לגדל@ee<ENG> (@ITfor@it growing) because once he had explained that “he shall be sacred” refers to the hair of his head, he explained how it would be sacred — that one should not cut it, rather grow it. The word @hh<HEB>פרע@ee<ENG> (growth) is also juxtaposed to the words “hair of his head” as if the verse were saying “for growing the growth of the hairs of the hair on his head.” @d1A small @BIpatach.@bo Meaning a @ITsegol@it which is referred to as a small @ITpatach@it. Furthermore there is also a real @ITpatach@it vowelized below the @ITreish@it. @d1Less than thirty days.@bo Meaning that [we may infer this law] because the Torah writes “He (his hair) shall be sacred [for] growing the growth of hair,” and the word @hh<HEB>יהיה@ee<ENG> (shall be) has the numerical value of 30 [which teaches us the number of] days.<QC>
@p1[8]@p2<TIE>From defilement.@bo Meaning that this is not like the words “he shall be sacred” above, where it was a description of his hair. @p1[9]@p2<TIE>A sudden incident.@bo Meaning that both words refer to the swiftness of the matter, that he did not realize that he would die and it was totally unavoidable. For if this was not so there would have been a partial transgression, or it would be possible that he had transgressed the prohibition (v. 6) “he shall have no contact with the dead.” The Nazirite saw that the person was ill and he should have been careful not to come into his tent in case he died, thus it would be a case of the unintentional bordering on the intentional. Therefore Rashi said another explanation that the words @hh<HEB>בפתע@ee<ENG> (suddenly) and @hh<HEB>פתאם@ee<ENG> (unexpectedly) are a single statement. @ITRe’m@it may also have alluded to this explanation. Now it is understandable why Rashi reverses the order of his commentary, initially explaining the words suddenly and unexpectedly and afterwards adding “if someone died in the tent.” Meaning that now it is understandable why the verse says @hh<HEB>עליו@ee<ENG> (near him) — meaning that it was sudden and unexpected, as if this had happened upon him without him being able to avoid it, so too this person died suddenly meaning that he had not been ill. When Rashi says “a sudden incident,” this is not to teach the meaning of the words @hh<HEB>פתע פתאם@ee<ENG> only that something sudden and unexpected is termed a @hh<HEB>מקרה@ee<ENG> (a [chance] incident). @d1In the tent.@bo Because if this were not so what difference would there be if someone died near him (given that there is no transfer of impurity in an open space), rather it must be explained as being “in the tent.” The word @hh<HEB>עליו@ee<ENG> (lit. upon him) is understood like [the meaning of] @hh<HEB>ועליו מטה מנשה@ee<ENG> (@ITnear@it him is the camp of Menashe). (@ITKitzur Mizrachi@it) The reason why Rashi did not comment according to the order of the verse, which says “if someone died near him” before “suddenly [or] unexpectedly” is because now that he had explained the alternative understanding that @hh<HEB>פתע פתאם@ee<ENG> (suddenly [or] unexpectedly) refers to a sudden incident there is a difficulty regarding the word @hh<HEB>עליו@ee<ENG>. This was understandable according to the first explanation that @hh<HEB>פתע@ee<ENG> refers to the unavoidable [chance event], there was no difficulty because since it was unavoidable it could be considered like the case in the verse “near him is the camp of Menashe”. @d1When he is sprinkled.@bo It is called his purification even though he is not completely purified until he brings his atonement offering. This is because the day of his sprinkling is his partial purification. @p1[10]@p2<TIE>Designated a time for the offerings.@bo Meaning for the sacrificing of the offerings, as is written in Parshas Emor@ee (@eeVayikra 22:27), “from the eighth day and onward it may be accepted as an offering.” @p1[11]@p2<TIE>He inflicted suffering on himself.@bo This implies that there was a transgression in abstaining from wine. You might ask: [How can we reconcile this with] Rashi’s explanation above that whoever sees a sotah@IT@it in her decadence should take the nazirite@IT@it vow against wine, [because wine can] lead to promiscuity. One answer is that it is certainly a mitzvah to take the nazirite vow against wine, but nonetheless it involves a minor transgression in causing oneself suffering by abstaining from wine. This is similar to one who fasts on Shabbos following a disturbing dream, this affliction of fasting likened to the great mitzvah of rejoicing on Shabbos, but nonetheless one has to fast again afterwards for one day to make up for fasting on Shabbos. Tosafos explain that the same is true here (Bava Kamma 91). Another answer is that it is certainly a mitzvah to abstain from wine, which intoxicates and leads to promiscuity. However new wine does not intoxicate, and [similarly] grapes, seeds and skins [so] this is the transgression of suffering by abstaining from them. You might ask: Since the Torah juxtaposed the chapter of the nazir to the chapter of the sotah it is implied that there is a mitzvah to take a nazirite vow against all types of wine and grapes in the manner of a nazir. The answer is that because one may not be able to restrain oneself and will be drawn after wine — which carries one even further — thus the Torah commanded one to take a nazirite vow against everything. As we say to the nazir “turn away, do not come close to the vineyard”. If nothing bad could come of it there would certainly have been a mitzvah to occasionally drink a little, because “wine and aromatic spices make one wise”. (@ITR. Y. Triosh@it) @p1[15]@p2<TIE>Of the burnt-offering and the peace-<FJ> offering.@bo To the exclusion of the sin-offering, for the Torah writes shortly (v.17) “He shall make the ram a peace-offering .<TIE>.<TIE>. and his meal-offering and libation” which refer to the ram as Rashi explains. But why did the Torah have to write this? Are they not included in the group of rams that require libations? Why were they mentioned separately? Rather it was to compare to them, just as peace-offerings can be brought as vowed-offerings or freewill-offerings and require meal-offerings and libations, so too all [all offerings that come] .<TIE>.<TIE>. This comes to exclude the sin-offerings that cannot be brought as vowed-offerings and freewill-offerings and do not require meal-offerings and libations (@ITPerek Shtei Middos@it). @d1Ten of each kind.@bo We learn a @ITgezeirah shavah@it (a masoretic link between two similar words) with the word ‘matzos’ from ‘matzos’ in the case of the thanksgiving-offering. There one requires ten loaves of each type as it writes in Parshas Tzav regarding the thanksgiving-offering “and offer from it one of each as ‘@ITterumah’@it offering” (Vayikra 7:14) meaning like one takes @ITterumah@it from @ITma'aser@it in the ratio of 1 from 10.<QC>
@p1[17]@p2<TIE>He shall slaughter.@bo Meaning that the word @hh<HEB>יעשה@ee<ENG> (“he shall make”) means “he shall slaughter.” This is because the entire matter is dependent upon the time of slaughter — if one has an intention at that time to eat it after the allotted time or outside its designated place then it becomes invalid. Rashi also explains “along with the basket of matzos” to mean with the intent to sanctify the bread, because without this one would understand that he slaughtered with the intent to sanctify the basket but not the bread inside. @d1The Ram’s.@bo So that one not say that it refers to each one of offerings mentioned above. This comes to exclude the sin-offering which does not. As above (v. 15) @p1[18]@p2<TIE>But this would be grossly disrespectful.@bo Because he would have to stand bareheaded, therefore it is forbidden to shave in the courtyard. @d1After the slaughter.@bo As if it had said “the nazir shall shave” after the slaughter of the offering at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. This refers to the peace-offering. @d1The pot.@bo Rashi is answering the question: “Put it in the fire” implies that he should place it directly to the fire, while afterwards it writes “which is under the peace-offering sacrifice” implying that it is under the flesh of the peace-offering. The flesh was cooked in a pot thus this would imply that one would also have to place the hair in the pot that was beneath the peace-offering. Therefore he explains that it was underneath the pot .<TIE>.<TIE>. meaning that the word “underneath” does not refer to under the flesh inside the pot, rather to the fire that was underneath the pot. @d1Were cooked in the courtyard.@bo The peace-offerings of a nazir may be eaten anywhere, and are like unconsecrated meat. Nonetheless one must cook them in the courtyard because one must remove the foreleg, which is sacred, after it has been cooked and give it to the kohein. Because of this foreleg that is given to the kohein one must cook it in the courtyard. @p1[19]@p2<TIE>After it was cooked.@bo Meaning that one gives it to the kohein once it is cooked. One might ask: Why doesn’t the foreleg, which is consecrated, prohibit the meat of the ram that was cooked along with it? The answer is that since the foreleg comprises one sixtieth of the ram it is considered annulled in sixty times its volume. @p1[20]@p2<TIE>The loaf.@bo The word @hh<HEB>הוא@ee<ENG> (it) which normally refers to a single item, refers to what was waved, as dictated by the context. Thus it refers to the three items and @hh<HEB>הוא@ee<ENG> is in place of @hh<HEB>הם@ee<ENG> (they). @d1Besides the breast.@bo Meaning that the word @hh<HEB>על@ee<ENG> (lit. upon) substitutes for the word @hh<HEB>מלבד@ee<ENG> (“besides”), rather than its literal meaning of “upon”. Rashi mentions what is “due to him” meaning those items mentioned previously in Parshas Tzav (Vayikra 7:34), and the peace-offerings of the nazir are included among them. They were only written here for the foreleg that is added in the nazirite peace-offerings but is not part of the other peace-offerings. @d1Because the [nazirite] peace-offerings were.@bo You might ask: If so, since the nazirite peace-offerings were included in the group of normal peace-offerings, where the Torah writes “for the breast of the wave offering …” (Vayikra 7:34) why did the Torah have to write “besides the breast of the wave-offering<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” here? Rashi answers that it is “because the [nazirite] peace-offerings<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”<QC>
@p1[21]@p2<TIE>Relative to a hundred burnt-offerings.@bo But not relative to a hundred sin-offerings. When the Torah writes “what he can afford to bring” it only refers to offerings that come as vowed-offerings or freewill-offerings that are dependent on what one can afford. @d1Increase but not reduce.@bo Meaning that because the verse explains “according to his vow that he vow, so shall he fulfill” this implies whether one increased or reduced from what was prescribed. Therefore it writes “@hh<HEB>על@ee<ENG> (in addition to) the laws of his nazirite [vows]” where @hh<HEB>על@ee<ENG> literally means “upon” – such as when one vows more than the law of the nazirite vow. However if it was less than the law of the nazirite vow, such as where one said “I am hereby a nazirite five times …” [this is not effective].<QC>
@p1[23]@p2<TIE>Like @HB<HEB>זכור@BO<ENG> (remembering).@bo Meaning that it is in the present tense. This is how Rashi explains the word @hh<HEB>זכור@ee<ENG> (Shemos 20:8) — that one should pay attention to continuously remember, denoting an ongoing action. @d1They all hear.@bo According to this the word @hh<HEB>אמור@ee<ENG> (“saying”) refers to Aharon and his sons while the word @hh<HEB>להם@ee<ENG> (“to them”) means to the Bnei Yisroel. It is as if it had said “each one of you shall say the subsequent blessings @hh<HEB>יברכך@ee<ENG>, @hh<HEB>יאר@ee<ENG>, @hh<HEB>ישא@ee<ENG> to Yisroel. (@ITGur Aryeh@it) explains that when the Torah states “saying to them” while it should have said “bless them”. It only spoke in the terminology of “saying” to teach that the blessing should be like a statement — that they hear the blessing.<QC>
@p1[27]@p2<TIE>I will concur.@bo But one should not explain that He would bless them Himself, because what would be the purpose of the blessing of the kohanim if Hashem were to bless them. @d1[And I] will bless them—the @BIkohanim@bo. According to the first explanation the words “And I will bless them” means that I will concur with them, but this appears forced therefore Rashi says another interpretation. According to the last explanation there is also a difficulty: The implication of the verse is that it refers to Yisroel and not to the kohanim, therefore the first explanation was also required. @p1[1]@p2<TIE>Because he utterly dedicated.@bo It appears that Rashi is answering the question: The notation above the words “Moshe finished” separate it from the words “erecting the Mishkon” meaning that “Moshe finished” is not to be read together with “erecting the Mishkon” and it is as if they are two separate topics. But what two topics could there be here? Rather one must say that the verse is to be explained as saying “It came to pass on the day that Moshe finished @ITthe making of the Mishkon@it and the erection of the Mishkon”. Thus Rashi asks “Betzalel and all the wise-hearted men<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” He answers that “because he utterly dedicated himself<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” With this one may answer the widely asked question: The verse merely attributes the erection of the Mishkon to Moshe, and he did this alone as is written previously in Parshas Pekudei (Shemos 39:33) Maharai explains that Rashi was answering the question: The Torah should have merely said “It came to pass, on the day Moshe erected the Mishkon. .<TIE>.<TIE>.<QC>
@d1On the second the [red] cow was burned.@bo Rashi wished to answer this so that you would not ask: Didn’t the Levites begin their service immediately after the erection of the Mishkon as is written shortly? How would they be permitted to do this, since they were impure due to contact with a corpse and could not be purified since the red cow has not yet been burned? One cannot say that the cow was burned before the erection of the Mishkon because concerning its sprinkling in Parshas Chukas (Bamidbar 19:4) the Torah writes “opposite the face of the tent” implying that the Mishkon has already been erected when it was slaughtered. He answers “on the second, the cow was burned<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” thus it emerges that they were purified on the seventh. @d1And on the seventh they were shaven.@bo This is the shaving mentioned in Parshas Beha’alosecha (Bamidbar 8:7) “and they shall pass a razor over their entire bodies<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”<QC>
@p1[2]@p2<TIE>They were officers.@bo Rashi is answering the question: What is the Torah teaching by saying that they were the leaders of the tribes? In response Rashi explains that they were officers over them in Egypt, and the verse is saying that they were the leaders who were appointed officers over them in Egypt. The taskmasters would beat the officers with clubs because they did not pressure Bnei Yisroel to fulfill their quota of bricks. [However this presents a difficulty:] Even those who stood by during the counting were not appointed until Iyar. The answer is that the Torah speaks about the future, when they would stand by during the counting on the first of Iyar. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) is puzzled: The officers who were beaten were only chosen for the Sanhedrin at the incident of the complainers in Parshas Beha’alosecha (11:16) where the Torah writes “gather seventy men for Me, from among the elders of Israel, men] whom you know to be the people’s elders and its officers.” Rashi explains that they are those “whom you know,” who were appointed as officers over them in Egypt during the hard labor. The incident of the complainers was on the twenty-second of Iyar and here it was Rosh Chodesh Nissan. Rather one must say that the greatness of becoming the Sanhedrin was more than the greatness of becoming the leaders. Therefore, here on Rosh Chodesh Nissan they merited to become leaders and on the twenty-second of Iyar at the time of the complainers they merited to become the Sanhedrin. @p1[3]@p2<TIE>Because Moshe did not accept.@bo Because if this were not so what would be meant by “before the Mishkon,” surely it had already written “They brought their offerings before Hashem” meaning before the Mishkon where His Glorious Presence rested. For this reason Rashi also explains that “before the altar” (v. 10) means that he did not accept it from them. Since it had already written “The leaders brought forward the [offerings for] the consecration of the altar,” why would I need it to add that they placed them before the altar?<QC>
@p1[10]@p2<TIE>Moshe did not accept [the gift] from their hands until…@bo Because if this were not so, what would be meant by “before the altar” and “Hashem said to Moshe<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” which comes afterwards (v. 11)? This implies that if Hashem had not said this to him he would not have accepted them. When Hashem said to him “one leader each day<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Even though we do not find that Moshe was uncertain about this, as Rashi explained only (v. 11) “whether in order of their birth<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Nevertheless Hashem Himself answered, without Moshe’s question, lest he err and say that all should bring their offerings on one day. Since all of them had brought forward their offerings together, and they were all zealous in performing the mitzvah, it would have been correct for them to be equal in bringing them, thus Hashem had to say “one leader each day”. @ITRe’m@it writes that he was also uncertain whether they should all would bring their offerings on one day or each one on his individual day. Immediately Hashem answered him “one leader each day.” See his question and answer there. However, since it was not needed for the explanation I have been brief and not quoted it. @ITRe’m@it writes that one might wonder how Moshe could have been uncertain as to the order of those offering, whether it was in order of their birth or in the order of the traveling. Surely the order of the traveling was not established until the first of Iyar, as is explained in Parshas Bamidbar (1:1). One answer is that from the time that Moshe was at Mount Sinai for the second set of forty days Hashem informed him that the firstborn were replaced by the Levites and the division of the banners and the order of the traveling of the camps. It appears to me Moshe knew the order of the traveling and the division of the banners from Yaakov, as Rashi explains in Parshas Bamidbar on the verse “each man at his own banner with the insignia<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (2:2) “by the sign their forefather [Yaakov] gave them …” It stands to reason that with the traveling it was also so, because there is no reason for the travels to be different from the banners. @p1[12]@p2<TIE>But not that he solicited [payment].@bo Meaning that the meaning of the @ITlamed@it in@hh<HEB>למטה יהודה@ee<ENG> (@ITof@it the tribe of Yehudah) is not like the @ITlamed@it of @hh<HEB>אמרי לי@ee<ENG> (say @ITfor@it me) (Bereishis 20:13), in which case it would have meant “@ITfor@it the tribe of Yehudah” — that he solicited payment from his tribe and brought it forward. Thus the meaning of @hh<HEB>למטה@ee<ENG> is like @hh<HEB>ממטה@ee<ENG> (@ITfrom@it the tribe). (@ITGur Aryeh@it) You might ask: Why did it write @hh<HEB>למטה@ee<ENG>? It should have written “the one that brought his offering on the first day [was] Nachshon the son of Aminadav, leader of Yehudah” as it writes for the other leaders. Then it would not have had to write that it was the offering of Nachshon. It appears that the answer is that the verse comes to say that this leader did not merit greatness — to offer first — because of who he was. All of the leaders were equivalent [in their personal qualities]. Rather it was because of his tribe, the tribe of Yehudah, who were fitting be first. Thus the Torah writes “of the tribe of Yehudah” meaning that he was secondary and his significance came to him by virtue of his tribe, the tribe of Yehudah who were the primary factor. @p1[13]@p2<TIE>As a voluntary meal-offering.@bo This is the first meal-offering mentioned in Vayikra, not the meal-offering of the libations. This is learned from the context. Just as “filled with incense” (v. 14) refers to a voluntary offering, so too “the fine flour” is also a voluntary offering. @p1[14]@p2<TIE>The weight of ten.@bo Rashi is answering the question: “Ten gold [shekolim]” implies that there were ten gold coins, and how could this be, because if it was a spoon it could not have been a gold coin. @d1We do not find.@bo Meaning that we do not find any individual who brought incense upon either of the two altars. Furthermore incense is only burned upon the inner altar. Thus here there were two changes from the norm. @p1[15]@p2<TIE>The best.@bo Here the Torah does not mention any number that is greater than one such that it had to explicitly write the word “one” to distinguish this from the other number. Rather this came in order to expound. Another answer is that because the Torah deviated, writing “one bull, young” and did not write “a young bull, one” (as with the other animals in this verse) this certainly came in order to expound. @p1[16]@p2<TIE>To atone for the grave of the abyss.@bo Meaning of “the grave of the abyss” is when one did not realize about at all, as if it had been buried in the abyss where a person does not think that there may be a grave. It was still necessary for them to purify themselves from this “impurity” and from contact with a doubtful impurity. If they did not then they would not be permitted to come to the sanctuary or to the courtyard because their doubtful impurity that can be atoned for by way of the he-goat sin-offering must be atoned for. However a definite impurity would be overridden by a communal offering such as the Pesach-offering, this overrides impurity if most of the community are impure, as the Torah writes “in its time” — even in impurity. @ITRe’em@it expands upon this, but I have been brief.<QC>
@p1[19]@p2<TIE>930 corresponding to the years.@bo Rashi brings these allusions in order to relate to the simple understanding of the verses. For if this were not so, what is the relevance detailing these utensils by their number and weight, and similarly in detailing the animals teaching that all the leaders agreed to them, neither subtracting or adding? This is even though it is not the manner of Rashi to bring interpretations such as this (@ITRe’m@it). (@ITGur Aryeh@it) Rashi brought these numerical values here upon the offerings of Nesanel the son of Tzu’ar because he gave this advice and if there had not been an important symbolism with wisdom and appropriate reasoning they would not have listened to him, also they would not have needed this advice. You might ask: How are the ages of Adam and Noach relevant here? The answer is that the Mishkon was representative of the creation of the world, as is brought in Shemos Rabbah, Parshas Pekudei. Therefore their offerings were related to all of the foundations of the world — Adam, Noach and the seventy nations, the Torah, the Ten Commandments and the fathers of the world upon whom the world stands.<QC>
@p1[24]@p2<TIE>On the third day, the leader was.@bo Rashi is answering the question: “On the third day the leader was<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” implies that on the third day he was the leader, but afterwards he was not the leader.<QC>
@p1[84]@p2<TIE>On the day [they were] anointed. @bo(Kitzur Mizrochi) It appears to me that this is a copyist’s error and it should read “on the day @hh<HEB>אותו@ee<ENG> (@ITit@it) was anointed,” this refers that which was written above “It came to pass on the day Moshe finished<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (v. 1). For we do not find a verse anywhere referring to the day that he anointed @ITthem@it, however we do find written “on the day @ITthey@it were anointed” (Vayikra 7:36) regarding the sons of Aharon. This is quoted here in Bamidbar Rabbah in relation to another matter and consequently the copyists erred and also wrote @hh<HEB>אותם@ee<ENG> (them) here. @d1These are the very ones.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Why do I need it to count one spoon for each day since I know that the will total twelve? @p1[85]@p2<TIE>By which shekel standard.@bo Meaning that if not for this verse one would have said that the “holy shekel” written regarding the bowl referred to it alone. Therefore it wrote “one hundred thirty [shekolim@IT@it was the weight of] each tray<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @d1Precision.@bo Meaning that each one was precisely the weight of the other, even though the scales of an individual do not normally weigh exactly, however the Sanctuary vessels were exactly the same. It appears to me that the reason was to show that even though the thoughts of each leader were directed towards his tribe, as Rabbeinu Bachaye writes in this Parshah, the volumes and the weights were equal to show that they all intended them for the same God. @p1[86]@p2<TIE>It was golden and it weighed.@bo Meaning that I would not know whether the word “gold” written regarding the spoon refers to the spoon — which was golden, or whether it was actually silver and its weight was “of gold”, given that the shekolim of gold and those of silver were not equal. Therefore the Torah said “golden spoons”, juxtaposing the words “gold” and “spoon” to teach that the spoon was golden and that [the words] “ten gold” refers to the spoon. @ITRe’m@it. You might ask: Why didn’t Rashi answer as he did previously, that the number was written because they were the exact same ones that were donated. For even without his answer one would have to say so, given that the Torah writes “bowls of silver, twelve” where this raises the difficulty: Why do I need the number? One must answer that they are the exact ones etc. Thus, we see that it is normal of the Torah to teach the same novelty for each and every utensil. It appears to me that Rashi was answering the question: Why did it write “golden” when it should have just written “twelve spoons”? @ITRe’m@it answers that the number was written in order to tell one that they were the exact same ones that were donated, however since the word “gold” and “spoons” were juxtaposed we also learn like I explained above.<QC>
@p1[2]@p2<TIE>Because the flame rises.@bo Rashi is answering the question: How is the term “When you cause to rise” appropriate for lamps such that Scripture writes @hh<HEB>בהעלותך@ee<ENG> (when you cause to rise) instead of @hh<HEB>בהדלקתך@ee<ENG> (when you light)? He answers that it is because the flame rises, meaning that this was why the terminology of ‘rising’ is appropriate. Rashi also answers another question: Nonetheless the Torah should have written “when you light,” so why does it write “when you cause to rise”? It is certain that the term “when you cause to rise” may also be appropriate regarding lamps, as Rashi explains “because the flame rises,” however the term “when you light” is more correct. He answers that it is written “when you cause to rise” in order to teach that “he is required to ignite<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” However [one may ask another question:] in Parshas Tetzaveh (Shemos 27:20) regarding the lighting of the continual flame, Rashi only answers why it is written “to cause to rise” rather than “light.” He says that he is required to ignite [the lamp] until the flame rises by itself. The answer is that there it is written @hh<HEB>להעלות@ee<ENG> “to cause to rise” in the command form, therefore Rashi explains why the command was given with the term “to cause to rise” rather than the term “to light” which is a clearer command. He answers that because “he is required to ignite<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” which is a component of the command, therefore it is written “to cause to rise.” See @ITRe’m@it. @eeParshas Emor (Vayikra 24:2) is the real source of this command, as Rashi explains there. The question is why did Rashi did explain anything there? The answer is that he relies upon his explanation in Parshas Tetzaveh about the term “to cause to rise” which was in the command form, as explained. @ITRe’m@it explains similarly that a commentator will sometimes explain all matters that relate to a term, sometimes he will explain some of them and sometimes he will rely upon what he explained elsewhere. Therefore Rashi gave no explanation in Parshas Emor, even though the term “to cause the continual flame to rise” is written there. @d1That there was a platform.@bo Even though we [already] learned from here that he had to ignite until the flame rises by itself, one may explain that the main source for expounding this is from the verse in Parshas Tetzaveh concerning the lighting of the continual flame, and here Rashi mentions it in passing. Another answer is that if it only came to teach that the flame should rise by itself, Scripture should have written “to cause to rise” and not “when you cause to rise.” And if it came only to teach about the platform then it should have written “when you rise up.” Rather the Torah writes “when you cause to rise” to expound both points. @ITRe’m@it explains that the implicit meaning of this teaching (about the platform) and the one that the flame should rise by itself are evenly balanced; therefore [since neither is more implicit than the other] we are able to learn both. @d1Upon which the @BIkohein@BO stood.@bo You might ask: Surely a man is four @ITamos@it high, corresponding to twenty-four tefachim, while the height of the menorah was only eighteen tefachim, as Rashi explains in Parshas Terumah (Shemos 25:35). If so, why does he need a platform? The answer is that the tefachim of the Temple were ‘extended,’ such that the eighteen tefachim of the menorah were equal to twenty-four regular tefachim, i.e. equal to the height of a man. If one comes to clean the lamps he needs to see inside the lamps in order to clean them, therefore he needed a platform. (@ITDivrei Dovid@it) Were all the kohanim of equal height? Surely it is possible that a kohein has a slightly shorter stature. Thus there needs to be a platform there so that every kohein can comfortably perform the service of the menorah. @d1Their wicks.@bo Meaning that since it is written “shall the seven lamps cast light,” one is forced to say that it refers to the wicks, since they cast light. For if it refers to the lamps, the cups (containing the oil), it should have said “toward the face of the menorah shall the seven lamps @ITtilt@it.” @eeYou might ask: The verse writes “toward the face of the menorah” meaning that all seven lamps should cast light towards the lamp of the middle branch, but Rashi explains that only six cast light towards the middle lamp. The answer is that Rashi is answering a different question: “Shall the seven lights cast light” implies that all of them cast light before the middle branch, i.e. above it, which is termed the ‘face of the menorah.’ However this is not possible. Granted that the lamp on the middle branch casts light above it, however the six other lamps only illuminate the area above their own branches. Such is the manner of all lamps, which cast light upon themselves. He answers that the six other lamps that were on the six branches also cast light towards the middle branch. Because of the six lamps that were on the six branches, the three eastern ones turned towards the middle .<TIE>.<TIE>. meaning that the ends of the wicks were bent towards the middle branch, and the same with the western ones. Thus “the seven lamps cast light” means that in this fashion the seven lamps cast light towards the middle branch. @ITRe’m@it expands upon this. (See @ITResponsa of Rivash@it siman 400). @ee(@ITGur Aryeh@it) raises a difficulty: If this is so, the Torah should have said “the @ITsix@it lamps cast light” because only six cast light toward the menorah. Some explain that the verse is to be understood as follows: “When you light the lamps, towards the face of the menorah” meaning that when you light them the lamps should be towards the menorah — six should face toward the middle. But “the seven lamps shall cast light” is a separate phrase meaning that in this fashion the seven lamps should cast light. @p1[3]@p2<TIE>To indicate his virtue.@bo For if not so, why is it necessary to write “Aharon did so”? Would one think that he did not do what Hashem commanded him through Moshe? Even though we would know on our own that he fulfilled Hashem’s command, nonetheless, it is great matter and therefore the Torah attests to his righteousness, as it does in similar cases. @eeOne may inquire: why does it repeat “towards the face of the menorah he lit”? It appears that Rashi explains (v. 2) [that the lamps were directed] “towards the middle” so that one not say that He requires the light. Rather it is in order to elevate you above the nations, as the Midrash says “all the time that the lamps are lit, you will rule over the nations.” Even though the Rabbis say that Yisroel only received the Torah in order that no nation would rule over them, as it is stated “@hh<HEB>חרות@ee<ENG> (engraved) on the Tablets” (Shemos 32:16) do not read @hh<HEB>חרות@ee<ENG> (engraved) rather @hh<HEB>חירות@ee<ENG> (free). If so, why was the menorah needed? The answer is: Due to the severity of the sin of the golden calf which Aharon made, the nations would rule, as the Torah states “I had said, ‘You are godlike beings.<TIE>.<TIE>.’” (Tehillim 82:6). This was Aharon’s virtue, that he did not deviate from lighting opposite [the face of the menorah], even though doing so recalled his sin, which made the menorah necessary. @ITR@it. @ITYaakov Triosh@it. @p1[4]@p2<TIE>Since he had difficulty with it.@bo Meaning that the word “this” refers to the instruction, but the actual [making the menorah] was only at the time when Betzalel made it. Initially Moshe had difficulty with it until Hashem showed him by pointing with the finger. He again had difficulty until Hashem said to Moshe “take a kikar<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” see above in Parshas Terumah (Shemos 25:31). @d1Lump.@bo Lump is a term meaning “piece.” @d1Shears.@bo [Like] scissors. @d1The menorah proper.@bo Rashi is resolving the apparent contradiction: Here it implies that it was only beaten from its base until its flowers, while in Parshas Terumah (ibid.) it is written that it was entirely beaten out. @d1Delicate work.@bo Meaning that from its largest point until the thinnest it was all one piece. Thus the word @hh<HEB>עד@ee<ENG> (lit. until) is used in the sense of “between.” Rashi makes a similar explanation in Parshas Bo (Shemos 11:5) referring to the verse “from the firstborn of Pharaoh sitting on the throne<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”<QC>
@d1According to the form.@bo Rashi is answering the question: “According to the vision” implies the sense of an appearance which denotes color, but it is not correct to say that Hashem showed him the color of the menorah. Alternatively “according to the vision” refers to a vision of prophesy, meaning that just as he saw in the prophetic vision of fire, they too should make a menorah of fire. However, this cannot be so because he did not make it of fire. Therefore Rashi explains “according to the form” meaning that “according to the vision” is understood as “according to the form,” as we see written elsewhere, “Observe and make them according to the form” (Shemos 25:40). The “form” was described in terms of a “vision” because by seeing [the vision] he learned its form. @d1The one who made it.@bo Meaning the one who made all of the utensils; this was Betzalel. @d1It was made spontaneously.@bo This is explained in Parshas Terumah. This Midrash disagrees with the first explanation. @p1[6]@p2<TIE>Take them with words of persuasion.@bo [The Torah] does not mean to physically “take” them, in the sense of an acquisition and the bringing of something into one's domain. The Levites were not acquired and they were not brought into his domain. See Parshas Lech Lecha (16:3) Bereishis on the verse “Sorai, wife of Avrom, took.” @p1[7]@p2<TIE>For some of them were defiled by contact with the dead.@bo Not by other forms of impurity, because other forms of impurity do not require sprinkling. @d1Who practiced idolatry.@bo (@ITMinchah Blulah@it) Even though others who practice idolatry are not required to shave, these were different because they served the golden calf and were afflicted with leprosy. As the Rabbis expounded the verse “for it is @hh<HEB>פרוע@ee<ENG> (revealed), for Aharon has @hh<HEB>פרעה@ee<ENG> (revealed) it” (Shemos 32:25) where they learn a gezeirah shavah to the leper — where the Torah writes “his head shall be @hh<HEB>פרוע@ee<ENG> (unshorn)” (Vayikra 13:45). @p1[8]@p2<TIE>What does the Torah teach [by specifying] ‘a second’?@bo Though it is written “and the second sheep<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (Bamidbar 28:4) regarding the Tamid offering, this was because it is [also] written “the first sheep.” However here it is not written “the first,” therefore the terminology of “a second” is not appropriate. @d1That it was a temporary ruling.@bo Meaning that when Rashi explains “so the sin-offering was not eaten” even though other sin-offerings are eaten, this was a temporary ruling. And you should know that it was a temporary ruling, because they should have brought a goat as a sin-offering for idolatry along with the bullock burnt-offering, as is normal when the congregation performs idolatry. Why then did they bring a bullock for the sin-offering — it must have been a temporary ruling, therefore regarding this matter (eating the offering) it was also a temporary ruling. However even without this, we could still say that it was a temporary ruling. For external sin-offerings (those offered outside the Sanctuary) are eaten, but this one for the inauguration of the Levites, who were installed through it, was burned. @eeOne should not say that this sin-offering was offered inside the Sanctuary, given that it was burned and then say that “just as a burnt-offering is burned so too the sin-offering was burned,” that it is offered inside. @ITR’em@it. @p1[9]@p2<TIE>And stand near.@bo Even though the Levites were only an atonement-offering for the firstborn, as explained above, nonetheless, since the firstborn were part of the congregation of Yisroel, they were termed the entire congregation of Yisroel as if they were all of Yisroel.<QC>
@p1[11]@p2<TIE>Requires waving.@bo A leper is termed “dead” as it says at the end of the Parshah “please, let her not be like the dead” (12:12) and the Levites were as an atonement for the firstborn who worshiped idols, which is termed “sacrifices of the dead.” Therefore, the Levites required “live waving” like the guilt-offering of a leper. Furthermore, the waving of the Levites would only be possible while they were alive. @d1Three wavings.@bo Rashi does not ask why the verse states three wavings, because one may answer that it is a decree of the Torah that he had to wave them three times. However, now that Rashi explained “just as the leper’s guilt-offering requires waving<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” and the guilt-offering of a leper only requires one waving, he asks why are three wavings required here? @p1[17]@p2<TIE>Since I protected them.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Why does Hashem say “for every firstborn [of Bnei Yisroel] is Mine” which implies that they are still His, when it is written (v. 18) “I have taken the Levites” which implies that He had already taken them. In response [to this question] Rashi explains that “they were Mine by the rules of justice” [meaning according to the strict interpretation of the law]. @ITRe’m@it writes that with this he answers that “for every first born is Mine” does not refer to the present, because they were disqualified when they erred with the golden calf. It merely means that they were His initially. Rashi also informs one of the reasons why they were His by the rules of justice — “because I protected them<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @eeRashi states “I took them for Myself” instead of “I have sanctified them [to be mine]” in order to correspond with “I have taken the Levites instead of all firstborn” (v. 18) which means I have now taken them for Myself in the place of those whom I had taken before. He adds a @ITvav@it on the word @hh<HEB>ולקחתי@ee<ENG> (@ITand@it I have taken) which is in the place of @hh<HEB>הקדשתי@ee<ENG> (I have sanctified) in order to indicate that they are two different ideas — “for every firstborn is mine .<TIE>.<TIE>. on the day in which I slew<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @ITand also@it “I have sanctified them” at that time for my service. However, once they sinned they were disqualified and I took the Levites instead of them. Rashi concluded “now I have taken” so that you should not say “I took them” (v. 18) refers to the time that I sanctified the firstborn for Myself. For it is written, “instead of all firstborn” which implies that they had left the service and the others entered in their place. @p1[19]@p2<TIE>Bnei Yisroel are mentioned five times.@bo Rashi brought this here because he was answering the question: He had explained that the words “I took them for Myself,” in the past tense, refer to the firstborn — meaning that “I took them for Myself and at that time I sanctified them for Myself.” Why then does the Torah need to say that Hashem had chosen them previously, did it not merely come to explain that he rejected them because they erred with the golden calf? Rashi answers that because of their preciousness and despite their rejection, He did not wish to mention their sin. Rather He mentions their praises and merits when Hashem brought them in to his service. You should know this by the fact that they were mentioned five times in one verse, due to their preciousness. In some editions of Rashi I have found the text “and I have given the Levites .<TIE>.<TIE>. [Bnei Yisroel are mentioned] five times<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” and this more correct. (This appears to be our text). @d1[If] they approach.@bo Meaning that this is an abbreviated phrase. For it should have said “I have given the Levites .<TIE>.<TIE>. to atone for the Bnei Yisroel so that the Bnei Yisroel will not need to approach the Holy and so that there will not be [a plague.<TIE>.<TIE>.].” The reason that the Levites were given to the Kohanim was so that they could serve, and the Israelites would not need to approach — so that there would not be a plague among Yisroel for if they were to approach, there would be a plague. The verse means to say the positive (if they approach there will be a plague), and not the negative “there will not be a plague among Yisroel” (if they do not approach). It is as if the Torah had said “Why were the Levites given to Aharon and his sons — in order that the Bnei Yisroel would not need to enter for this service and approach the Holy. And why should they not approach the Holy — in order that there will not be a plague among them.” @ITRe’m@it. @eeAlternatively, Rashi is answering the question: Is it because He now took the Levites that there would not be a plague with their approach to the Holy? Surely, it is written “the foreigner who approaches shall die” (Bamidbar 1:51). Therefore he explains that “so there will not be a plague among them” means “so for they will not need to approach the Holy.” For otherwise there would be a concern over a plague among them when they were to approach the Holy. @p1[20]@p2<TIE>The Israelites rested their hands.@bo So that you not say that all of them stood the Levites up, or that all of them waved them or all of them rested their hands. Rather the word “did” refers to the specific action of each one — Moshe placed them.<TIE>.<TIE>. @p1[22]@p2<TIE>No one objected.@bo For if this were not so, why would this [phrase “so they did unto them”] be necessary, surely the Torah already stated that “Moshe did .<TIE>.<TIE>. [just as Hashem commanded]” (v. 20). @ITRe’m@it writes that there is still a difficulty: This implies that because the Torah above wrote “Moshe did<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” we infer both the praiseworthiness of those who did and those with whom it was done. If so, regarding the verse “Aharon did so” (v.3) where it does not previously write that he did so, one could say that this comes to teach about the matter itself — that he fulfilled the commandment that he was instructed, and that it does not to relate his praiseworthiness. One could ask a similar question in Parshas Beshalach (Shemos 14:4) where the Torah does not initially write that he did so, and in many other places – where they expounded in the same manner. @eeIt seems to me that certainly in any place where the Torah writes “he did so” or “they did so” it would not have been necessary to do so, because ordinarily the Jews fulfilled and accepted all mitzvos that Moshe commanded, and “he did so” is written only in order to recount their praiseworthiness. However here, if it were not for the phrase “as [Hashem] commanded” we would not have inferred their praiseworthiness from the phrase “Moshe did [all that Hashem commanded].” One would have said that it was necessary, to teach that they fulfilled the mitzvah, because one could not say that this was obvious. Hashem Himself had to make “effort” in this regard, instructing Moshe “take the Levites” (v.6) which Rashi explains as meaning “take them with words — fortunate are you<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Many prohibitions and death penalties were dependant upon this mitzvah and the firstborn Israelites had been disqualified from the service of Hashem. Therefore it was necessary, to teach that they fulfilled what He commanded. However, one cannot learn their praiseworthiness from here; therefore the verse writes “as [Hashem] commanded” to relate their praiseworthiness. @p1[24]@p2<TIE>Favorable indications in his studies for five years.@bo The expectation is that the Torah only gave him these five years in order to study [the laws of the service] because this is the maximum time that one needs to engage in his studies. If so, one who does not see a favorable sign in all of these years will never see them. @p1[25]@p2<TIE>On the shoulder.@bo Rashi is answering the question: [Isn’t this phrase redundant, since] it is written afterwards “but he shall serve his brethren” (v. 26)? Therefore one is forced to say that “and he shall no longer work” refers to the [work of] carrying on the shoulder. The subsequent statement “but he shall serve his brethren” means “with his brothers.” However, one should not think that this is like the service of a slave to his master. Rather he shall serve with his brothers, the sons of Merori and Gershon, locking the gates, loading of the wagons and singing. @p1[1]@p2<TIE>Was not said until Iyar.@bo As it is stated (Bamidbar 1:1) “in the second month.” @d1That throughout the forty years.@bo Since it is written (v. 5) “on the fourteenth day<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” why was it necessary to say “in the desert of Sinai”? — At the beginning of the Parshah it writes “in the desert of Sinai”! Rather, it is to teach you that “throughout the forty years<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @eeYou might ask: Why did Moshe not compel them to offer the Pesach-offering? The answer is that in the desert there were many Jews who were not circumcised, and who did not circumcise their sons. In which case you might ask: If so, what was the discredit in this — surely they were unable to offer it? The answer is that they brought this about through their sin, because if it has not been for their sin, they would have entered the Land of Israel in another three days, as Rashi explains [below] on the verse “we are traveling<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (10:29) (Tosafos Kiddushin 38). @p1[2]@p2<TIE>Even during ritual uncleanliness.@bo Meaning that we learn this from the second “in its proper time” written in the [next] verse. For we have already learned from the first “in its time” that Pesach-offering overrides Shabbos. We learn the meaning of “in its proper time” from the Tamid-offering where it is written “in its proper time” and the Tamid-offering overrides Shabbos. Thus the second “in its proper time” is “extra” for us to learn that it overrides ritual uncleanliness (Sifri). Alternatively, one may say that that we learn both [laws] from one verse, because either law can be learned. @eeWhen the Torah writes (vs. 10-11) “any man who becomes unclean .<TIE>.<TIE>. shall make a Pesach-offering to Hashem in the second month” which implies that unclean people are pushed off to the second Pesach-offering, that applies specifically for a “man” — if an [individual] man is pushed off. But the [entire] community is not pushed off [to offer the second Pesach-offering]. Here the Torah is referring to the community or to the majority of the community who are ritually impure. In such a case the pure eat it in a state of purity, while the impure offer the Pesach-offering for themselves in a state of impurity (Pesachim 77). It is specifically [only] impurity caused by a corpse that is pushed aside, but not other impurities (Pesachim 79a). @p1[3]@p2<TIE>These are the commandments pertaining to its body.@bo The text should read “According to all its statutes,” these are the commandments pertaining to its body — a lamb; unblemished; male; a yearling. “And according to all its laws,” these are the commandments that have a bearing on the body of the animal — roasted over fire; its head with its knees and its inner organs. Those laws that pertain to outside its body, meaning originating from elsewhere — for example “seven days<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” This is also the version of the @ITRamban@it and @ITRe’m@it. However, those texts that write “according to all its laws<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” the seven days of eating matzoh and of eliminating chometz” are a copyist’s error. For if this were not an error, regarding the Pesach Sheni, the Torah also writes “according to its laws,” but nonetheless regarding the Pesach Sheni one @ITmay have matzoh and chometz@it together with him in his house, as Rashi explains later. See @ITKitzur Mizrochi@it and @ITNachalas@it @ITYaakov@it who resolve the text of Rashi that we have. @p1[4]@p2<TIE>Of God’s holidays.@bo However, our Rabbis do not ask why Hashem repeated the command of the Pesach-offering here, although He had already commanded it in Parshas Emor (Vayikra 23). In order that one should not say that they were exempt while in the desert, since the Torah linked it with entering the Land, therefore the Torah repeats itself and teaches it here. However, the statement of Moshe to Yisroel does not say to offer the Pesach-offering @ITin this month@it, only to offer the Pesach-offering. This implies that he only commanded them the law of the Pesach-offering and thus the Rabbis ask “What does the Torah teach?” (@ITRe’m@it) @eeIt appears to me that the Rabbis were answering the following question: Why did the Torah have to write “Moshe spoke<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” at all, it should have merely said “the Bnei Yisroel offered the Pesach-offering<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”? Logically, since Hashem commanded him to speak to them, Moshe certainly told them Hashem’s command. For in the beginning of the passage the Torah writes (8:2) “Speak to Aharon and say to him.<TIE>.<TIE>.,” and afterwards it is written “Aharon did so<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” But we do not see in the Torah that Moshe told Aharon Hashem’s command. Rather it is logical that he told him the command, given that afterwards it writes “Aharon did so<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Similarly the Torah writes “Hashem spoke to Moshe, take the Levites<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (8:5) but we do not find that Moshe told Yisroel Hashem’s command. Rather the Torah relies upon what is written afterwards “Moshe and Aharon and all the congregation of Yisroel did<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (8:20). Similarly, from the passage “There were men who were impure, having had [contact with] a corpse<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (9:6), we infer that Hashem told him [Moshe] the laws of the Pesach Sheni, but we do not find that Moshe told the laws to them [the people]. Rather it is logical that he related the laws to them. If so, why does the Torah state “Moshe spoke<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” when it should have relied on the verse [written afterwards] “they offered the Pesach-offering”? One cannot answer that he had not yet told them the laws of the Pesach-offering, and only he was relating the laws to them, and this is why it is written “Moshe said.<TIE>.<TIE>.,” for it is already written “Moshe spoke of God’s holidays<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (Vayikra 23:44). Therefore, the Rabbis teach as they do, “Evidently when he heard<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” This is what seems to me. @p1[7]@p2<TIE>He said to them: The sacred offerings cannot.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Why did they say “Why should we be excluded” — surely they were impure, and those who are impure are forbidden to offer an offering during the period of their impurity. If so, why was Moshe in doubt, telling them “Wait while I listen<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”? Furthermore, how did Moshe forget the passage of the sending out of the impure (5:2), which was said to him on Rosh Chodesh Nissan? He answers that “[The sacred offerings] cannot<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” and that his main question was only regarding the sprinkling of the blood for them in a state of impurity. This would be similar to the blood of a sin-offering which has the status of @ITkodshei kodshim@it (most sanctified) but whose meat is eaten by those who are pure. Certainly this can be applied to the Pesach-offering which is of lesser [sanctity]. @d1This chapter should have appropriately.@bo A question is widely asked: Why did Rashi link this to his previous comment? The answer is that if he had not explained “Fortunate is the mortal<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” I would have said that this chapter was not said in Moshe’s name as punishment for him having said “every difficult matter<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (Shemos 18:26). However now that he explained “Fortunate is the mortal<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” and the verse speaks in a manner that praises Moshe, why then is this passage not said in his name? Thus he explains “[This chapter should have] appropriately<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1[10]@p2<TIE>But that he was outside.@bo You might ask: Then why did the Torah say “distant<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”? The answer is that if it had said “on the road” but not said “distant” I would have said that only someone who is distant offers the Pesach Sheni. However if he is outside the threshold of the courtyard, then he would not. Therefore the Torah wrote “distant” and placed a dot over [the word] to expound that it does not mean literally “distant,” as I explained previously regarding “to pasture the flock” (Bereishis 37:12). @d1Matzoh and chometz may be with him.@bo You might ask: Why did Rashi append this to the earlier comment? The answer is that he is answering the question: Why is the dot necessary to teach that even if he was only outside the threshold of the courtyard, this is termed “distant” and he offers the Pesach Sheni? Without the dot one could have also learned this, given that the law of being distant was juxtaposed to the law of the one who was impure. One could learn from the following juxtaposition: just as someone who is impure [cannot bring the offering] even if he was in the city because he is outside the Temple courtyard, and thus must offer the Pesach Sheni; Similarly, when it is written “or on a distant road,” even if the person was [only] outside the courtyard he offers the Pesach Sheni. If so this raises a difficulty: Why is the dot needed, for even the word “distant” is not needed, according to this explanation? Rashi answers that the dot comes to teach us that even regarding the Pesach Sheni — if he was outside the threshold of the courtyard for the entire period of the slaughter of the Pesach [Sheni]-offering he may not offer the Pesach Sheni. We need not ask that this is obvious, and why would one differentiate [between the first Pesach and Pesach Sheni], because we could answer that we find other differences in the offerings aside from this — since concerning the Pesach Sheni matzoh and chometz are with him in the house .<TIE>.<TIE>. Thus, one might have said that the laws are also different in this matter. Consequently the dot is necessary [to teach that this law is the same]. @p1[15]@p2<TIE>For the tablets of the testimony.@bo Rashi is answering the question: “Mishkon” refers to the lower curtains, as he explains in Parshas Bamidbar (3:25), while the term “@hh<HEB>אהל@ee<ENG>” (tent) refers to the goats hair curtains that were above it. If so, how does the Torah say @hh<HEB>המשכן לאהל@ee<ENG> (lit. the Mishkon @ITfor@it the tent) which implies that the Mishkon was needed for the tent? Consequently, Rashi explains that it was “made to be a tent<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @ITRe’m@it explains Rashi’s addition of the word “made” before the word @hh<HEB>לאהל@ee<ENG> (@ITfor@it a tent). Since the @ITlamed@it of @hh<HEB>לאהל@ee<ENG> implies its purpose, as if it had said “to be a tent,” without its addition one would imply that the purpose [of the Mishkon] was related to the word “covered” — i.e. that the cloud covered the Mishkon to form a tent. However with the word “made” it is understood as being related to the Mishkon — meaning that the Mishkon was made as a tent. Rashi’s addition of the word “to be” would thus be in place of the @ITlamed@it of @hh<HEB>לאהל@ee<ENG>. @eeFurthermore, when Rashi adds the words “for the tablets of the testimony” this teaches that the Tablets were a testimony to Yisroel, not the tent. This is to be contrasted with the phrase “Mishkon of Testimony” (Shemos 38:21), which Rashi explains that it is “testimony to Yisroel<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” For the word Mishkon (@hh<HEB>משכן@ee<ENG>) is related to the word Shechinah (@hh<HEB>שכינה@ee<ENG> — Divine Presence) which rests (@hh<HEB>שוכן@ee<ENG>) among us, a concept not appropriate for the word @hh<HEB>אהל@hh@ee<ENG>. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it). @eeI have already fully explained in Parshas Terumah (Shemos 25:16) that sometimes the Tablets are referred to as “testimony,” sometimes the Torah is referred to as “testimony” and sometimes the Mishkon is referred to as “testimony.” See also the beginning of Parshas Pekudei (Shemos 38:21) etc. and elsewhere. @d1Similarly, all the usages in the @BIparshah.@bo (@ITGur Aryeh@it) For the whole passage refers to what would take place continuously every day, as the Torah writes “so it always was” (v. 16). It would be incorrect to say “The cloud covered the Mishkon” in the past tense and later to say “in the evening it shall be over the Mishkon” in the future, because one does not follow from the other. Concerning the use of the word @hh<HEB>יהיה@ee<ENG> (lit. will be) in the future tense, see above in Parshas Beshalach on the verse “Thus sang<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (Shemos 15:1).<QC>
@p1[17]@p2<TIE>Was lifted.@bo But not in the sense of rising. For if this were so it should have said “whenever the cloud rose” in the active @hh<HEB>קל@ee<ENG> construct, rather than “was lifted” in the passive @hh<HEB>נפעל@ee<ENG> construct. @p1[18]@p2<TIE>This is in Sifri.@bo When Rashi said that we learned in [the Beraysa describing] the work of the Mishkon, all this is there until “tekiah, teruah and tekiah.” However when he says “they did not proceed until Moshe intoned: Arise Hashem” this is not in the Beraysa, thus regarding this comment Rashi says “this is in Sifri.” When he writes subsequently “then the banner of the camp of Yehudah departed” and also when he explains that “On the order of Hashem did they camp. When [the Israelites] were<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” all this is written in the Beraysa.<QC>
@p1[22]@p2<TIE>As in “a year<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”@bo Because the verse is going in ascending order (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it). See the comment above in Parshas Chayei Soroh on the verse “the girl shall stay with us for a year (lit. days)” (Bereishis 24:55).<QC>
@p1[2]@p2<TIE>At the time of departure of @HB<HEB>המחנות@ee@BO<ENG> (the camps).@bo Most texts read “departure of @hh<HEB>המסעות@ee<ENG> (the formations)” meaning at the time of the departure of the formations, each comprising three camps, each under its banner. Either way, with this Rashi ensures that one not say that when they wanted to travel they would sound the trumpets. For this is not the case; rather the cloud folded first, and afterwards Moshe would say “Arise Hashem.” Only afterwards would they sound the blasts. Therefore, Rashi explains that that at the time of the departure of the camps when they prepared themselves to travel, they would not depart until the trumpets were sounded. @p1[4]@p2<TIE>They too, meet.@bo Because if this were not so, the congregation and the leaders would differ in two matters. Rashi had to explain this in order to answer the question: In the verse it is written “they shall present themselves to you<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” but it does not write where they were to do so. Thus he explains “[they] too<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” since it is obvious that the words “they shall present themselves” are used to make a scriptural comparison. @d1This is derived from a scriptural comparison.@bo Here it is written @hh<HEB>ונועדו@ee<ENG> (they shall present themselves) and referring to the congregation it is written @hh<HEB>ונועדו@ee<ENG>. Just as there it refers to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, so too here it refers to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting. @p1[5]@p2<TIE>@BITekiah, teruah, tekiah@BO — this is how it is extrapolated by Sifri.@bo For it is written “if you blow (@hh<HEB>תקעתם@ee<ENG> — from the same derivation as the word “tekiah”) a teruah” (v. 6) implying a tekiah followed by a teruah. It then written “a teruah they shall blow (@hh<HEB>יתקעו@ee<ENG>)” implying a teruah followed by a tekiah. How is this understood — as a tekiah, teruah, tekiah. We need not ask: Why then do we not have two teruos in the middle? Because we never find two teruahs one after the other. The reason for having written “teruah” twice is that one is needed for a @ITgezeirah shavah @it(Scriptural comparison) to Yom Kippur, and any @ITgezeirah shavah@it is based upon superfluous wording. @p1[7]@p2<TIE>Since it says.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Firstly the Torah already writes above “you shall blow and you shall present yourselves<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Furthermore from where would one learn a requirement for a tekiah, teruah, tekiah such that it had to write “you shall blow [a tekiah] but not a teruah.” He answers “since it says, ‘They shall be used by you.<TIE>.<TIE>.’” @d1Perhaps, just as, when initiating the camps’ departure.@bo Since the two are compared together, one might have said that ‘just as when initiating the camps’ departure<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” therefore it was necessary to exclude this. @p1[10]@p2<TIE>Of the communal offerings.@bo Because the Torah writes “for your burnt-offerings and for your peace-offerings” juxtaposing peace-<FJ> offerings with burnt-offerings. All burnt-offerings are of the highest sanctity while some peace-offerings are of the highest sanctity and some are of lower sanctity — for example, the peace-offerings of the congregation are of the highest sanctity and those of the individual are of lower sanctity. Therefore, the peace-offerings were juxtaposed with the burnt-offerings to teach that just as the burnt-offerings are only of highest sanctity, so too these peace-offerings are only of the highest sanctity, referring to the peace-offerings of the congregation. We then return and learn the case of the burnt-offering from the peace-offering. Just as the peace-<FJ> offering which is of the highest sanctity is an offering of the congregation, since one never finds a peace-offering of the highest sanctity that is not an offering of the congregation, so too the case of the burnt-offering refers to an offering of the congregation. @d1As a remembrance.@bo This is the shofar and the remembrance. @p1[11]@p2<TIE>Twelve months minus ten days.@bo As is written in Parshas Yisro (Shemos 19:1). (@ITDivrei@it @ITDovid@it) asks: I do not know what Rashi is teaching us with this! It is apparently to resolve the difficulty with what is written above “or a year (lit. days) that the cloud prolonged its stay<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (9:22) which refers to a year. But where do we find that they camped for twelve months, given that the longest encampment was here at Chorev until [the journey to] the desert of Paran? This was not a complete year because Rosh Chodesh Sivan of the first year was the beginning of the encampment and on the twentieth of Iyar of the second year they traveled from there. He answers that only ten days were missing and since they were camped for most of Iyar it was as if they were there for the whole month, meaning that it was considered a complete year. @p1[12]@p2<TIE>Kivros Hata’avoh.@bo We see that from the desert of Paran, which was termed Kivros Hata’avoh, they traveled to Chatzeros, and afterwards it is written that the people traveled from Chatzeros and camped in the desert of Paran. But surely they had already been in the desert of Paran, which was Kivros Hata’avoh, as it is written here. Therefore Rashi explains that Kivros Hata’avoh was @ITin@it the desert of Paran, meaning that the desert of Paran covered a large area and contained the places called Kivros Hata’avoh and Chatzeros, which were all in the desert of Paran. In the end they arrived at the border of the desert of Paran, which is what was meant when the Torah says that they camped in the desert of Paran at the end of the Parshah (12:16). @d1After this journey.@bo So that one would not err and say that they camped there after the second journey, after leaving Kivros Hata’avoh, since that place was called Taveirah. For this reason Rashi explained that it was “after this journey.”<QC>
@p1[21]@p2<TIE>Who were preceded.@bo Meaning that Scripture uses abbreviated language. @hh<HEB>והקימו@ee<ENG> (they erected) either refers to those who erected, or it refers to the sons of Gershon and Merori who were mentioned previously. It is not possible to say that the Kehosites erected it before the arrival of the sons of Gershon and Merori. He adds that this was “when the cloud rested” and “the signal for making camp<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” because without this it would have appeared that the sons of Gershon and Merori who traveled before the camp would encamp in any place that saw fit. But this is impossible because it is written “they camped by the word of Hashem” (9:18). The meaning of “by the time of their arrival” is “before they arrived,” because the intent of this statement is that at the time when they arrived the Mishkon was set up and they would immediately place the Ark and the Holy vessels inside. @d1The departure of the two banners.@bo Meaning that the sons of Gershon and Merori would travel before the camps. When the Torah writes “the banner of the camp of Yehudah traveled” (v.13) and afterwards it is written “and dismantled the Mishkon” (v. 17), @ITRe’m@it explains that “the banner of the camp of Yehudah traveled” means that they @ITprepared@it to travel but not that they actually traveled, as it is explained there in depth. If so, the sons of Merori and the sons of Gershon preceded the sons of Kehos by two banners. Before the banner of the camp of Yehudah traveled, and immediately after they saw the cloud depart, Aharon and his sons came in and dismantled the Paroches and covered the Ark with it. The sons of Gershon and the sons of Merori then dismantled the Mishkon and loaded it onto the wagons and traveled. However, the Ark and the Holy vessels in the load of the sons of Kehos would remain covered and placed upon poles until the banner of the camp of Reuven traveled. @p1[25]@p2<TIE>They traveled in the shape of a box.@bo Like Rashi explains in Parshas Bamidbar (2:9) — the banner of Yehudah was on the east, Reuven’s on the south, Ephraim’s on the west and Don’s on the north. Therefore they had to spread out to a width of two banners and consequently [Don] had to be heavily populated. However, according to the opinion that they traveled one after the other in the shape of a beam, and deriving this from “gatherer for all the camps” — even if Don was not heavily populated, they could gather whatever was lost. You might ask: The tribes [traveling under the banner] of Yehudah were more populous than the tribes [traveling under the banner] of Don, because the tribes [traveling under the banner] of Yehudah comprised 186,400 while the tribes [traveling under the banner] of Don totaled only 157,600, as the Torah writes in Parshas Bamidbar (2:9, 31). (@ITGur Aryeh@it) answers: Yehudah traveled first, given that he was the king, and therefore the last to travel was Don who had the largest population after Yehudah. @d1Another opinion is that they traveled in the shape of a beam.@bo When they camped, it was in the shape of a box, as is written in Parshas Bamidbar. You might ask: According to the opinion that they traveled like a beam, how do we understand the words “as they camp, so shall they travel” (2:17). The answer is that as they camped — each man with his banner and his camp — so too they traveled; as it is written “Bnei Yisroel shall camp, each man at his own banner, and each man at his own camp” (1:52). @p1[28]@p2<TIE>This is the order of their journeys.@bo Rashi is answering the question: “These are the journeys” implies that it refers to the places where they camped and traveled from. However, here the Torah does not expand on the details; instead it describes them later in Parshas Masei. Thus Rashi explains that this is the order of their journeys, meaning that “these are the journeys” refers to the @ITorder@it of their journeys — how they would journey, who was first and who was last.<QC>
@d1On that day they journeyed.@bo Meaning on the day when the cloud was removed. One should not say that since the cloud preceded them by three days in order to prepare the way, they certainly traveled on the next day. For this reason Rashi explains that they traveled immediately. @ITRe’m@it explains that “They journeyed on that day” refers to the twentieth day of the second month. However, “Bnei Yisroel traveled on their journeys” (v.12) merely means that they traveled according to the order of the banners journeying. @p1[29]@p2<TIE>This was Yisro.@bo Rashi is answering the question: It is not clear to whom the phrase “Moshe’s father-in-law” in this verse refers — whether it refers to Reuel or to Chovav his son? He answers that it refers to Chovav who was Yisro, as it states “Of the children<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @ITRe’m@it @eeThere are those who ask: Surely Rashi already gave this explanation in Parshas Yisro? Furthermore, why did he have to mention that Yisro had many names? The answer is that Rashi was answering the question: The Torah writes “Chovav son of Reuel<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” This presents a difficulty either way; if Chovav was Yisro, and Reuel was his father — then Yisro was not called Reuel. But if Chovav was the son of Yisro, meaning that Yisro was called Reuel then he could not have been called Chovav. If so, how do we find that he had seven names? Rashi answers that Chovav was Yisro and that he was also called Reuel. And do not be surprised that Yisro was called Reuel when his father was also called Reuel. With regard to his father, his actual name was “Reuel,” this is to be contrasted with Yisro who was called Reuel because of his actions — for he became a @hh<HEB>ריע לאל@ee<ENG> (a friend to God). @d1Within three days.@bo For it is not written “we are @hh<HEB>הולכים@ee<ENG> (going)” rather “@hh<HEB>נוסעים@ee<ENG> (journeying).” This implies that this was [still] their first journey, except that they sinned in the incident of the complainers. And what Rashi comments “within three days<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” his proof is because in this passage it is written “they traveled from the mountain of Hashem a journey of three days” (v. 33). @d1And he thought he would enter.@bo You might ask: In Parshas Shemos, Rashi explains the [meaning of the] words “in the hand of another whomever you wish to send” (4:13) that ultimately Moshe would not bring them into the Land, or be their redeemer in the future. From there we see that Moshe knew that a decree had been issued [so why did he now think that he may enter]? The answer is that he certainly knew that he would not enter the Land to be a leader over them, nonetheless he thought that he would enter like [an ordinary] person amongst them. However this raises a difficulty: At the end of Parshas Shemos (6:1) Rashi explains that “You will see what will be done to Pharaoh, but you will not see what will be done to the seven kings of the nations when I bring them in to the Land.” This implies that he would not enter at all. The explanation is that he certainly thought that he would enter, however the conquest of the Land of Israel lasted fourteen years and Moshe thought that Hashem was telling him that he would not [live to] see those fourteen years, rather that he would enter and die there. Therefore Rashi here states that he thought that he would enter, but @ITnot@it that he would bring them in — for Moshe knew that he would not bring them in. We also see this in Parshas Chukas (20:12). [One might ask:] In Parshas Beshalach (Shemos 15:17) Rashi comments on the phrase “you will bring @ITthem@it” that Moshe prophesied that he would not enter the Land of Israel, apparently not even as an ordinary Jew, while here Rashi comments that he thought that he would enter. The answer is that he prophesied but he did not know what he prophesied. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) He answers the difficulty stemming from the verse (Shemos 6:1) “@ITNow@it you will see…” — but you will not see the war with the seven kings. The verse is to be understood as follows: The decree of “because you did not believe in Me” (Bamidbar 20:12) had not yet been issued. Regarding that decree the Torah writes “therefore you will not bring this congregation in to the Land.” Rashi explains that He swore precipitously so that they would not engage in lengthy prayer over this, implying that they would have been able to annul the first decree through prayer. Therefore Moshe here says “we are journeying” because he was not concerned about the decree of “Now you will see…” because he thought that it would be annulled through prayer. Consequently, he did not wish to involve himself in lengthy prayers until the time came, and this is why he said “we are journeying.” @p1[30]@p2<TIE>Whether for the sake of my properties or for the sake of my family.@bo Because “to” is written twice. Rashi’s comment means to say “whether I go for the sake of my properties,” which I have as an inheritance and I will go to sell. Or “whether I go for the sake of my family,” in order to convert them — as we find (Shemos 18:27) that “he went to his land” where Rashi explains “to convert the members of his family.” Nonetheless it was his intention to return there but not to settle. I have found this said in the name of the Maharal of Prague. @p1[31]@p2<TIE>So that they will not say.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Why did he request that Yisro go with him, surely the journey would have been for his own benefit. Then, since he did not want any favors, Moshe should have left him. Rashi explains “so that they will not say<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @d1Past tense.@bo Meaning because he had seen the miracles and wonders that Hashem did for Yisroel. And that is what the verse is saying “You were eyes for us,” meaning that you saw it all with your eyes. @d1Future tense.@bo According to the first explanation the word @hh<HEB>לנו@ee<ENG> (for us) raises a difficulty, therefore Rashi brings another interpretation. However, according to the other interpretation there is a difficulty: Since the Divine Presence was among them and enlightened their eyes through Moshe, why would they need Yisro? Consequently Rashi brings the last interpretation. However, according to the last interpretation alone there is a difficulty that the Torah should have said “you shall be @ITlike@it eyes for us.” Therefore all the reasons are necessary. @p1[32]@p2<TIE>A fertile area of Yericho.@bo @hh<HEB>דושנה@ee<ENG> [means] fertile land.<QC>
@p1[33]@p2<TIE>They traveled in one day.@bo For if not so, why does it say “a journey of three days.” @d1Went with them.@bo Meaning that it was the Ark which traveled in front of them that went with them to war. Moshe made it before he brought down the second set of Tablets, and it was not the Ark that Betzalel made after Yom Kippur. After they removed the second Tablets from that Ark and placed them in the one that Betzalel had made, the broken Tablets were placed in it and remained there. This Ark would go out with them to war, as well as journeying in front of them. However, the Ark which contained the second Tablets would journey in the midst of the camp, as it is written in this Parshah (v. 21). @p1[34]@p2<TIE>Seven clouds.@bo The seven clouds are enumerated in Sifri: (1) “The Cloud of Hashem was above them” (here). (2) “Your Cloud stands” (Bamidbar 14:14). (3) “And in a Pillar of Cloud You go” (ibid.). (4) “When the Cloud tarried” (ibid. 9:19). (5) “When the Cloud was raised” (Shemos 40:36). (6) “If the Cloud was not raised” (ibid. v. 37). (7) “For the Cloud of God was over the Mishkon” (ibid. v. 38). All of them were related to the journeying and encampment of Bnei Yisroel. See @ITNachalas Yaakov@it and @ITGur Aryeh@it. @p1[35]@p2<TIE>That this is not its place.@bo And where is its place? Above in Parshas Bamidbar along with the banners and the journeying where the Torah writes “The Tent of Meeting journeyed, the camp of the Levites<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (2:17). It would have been correct for this to have been written after that verse, therefore Hashem made the @ITnuns@it as an indication, meaning that this chapter should have been written fifty (@ITnun@it has a numerical value of fifty) chapters previously. For this reason the Torah wrote the @ITnuns@it backwards to teach that its place is fifty chapters above and not fifty chapters below. @d1Between one punishment and the next.@bo You might ask: The last punishment — “the people were like complainers” — is clear; however what was the first punishment? The answer is that above it is written “and they traveled from the Mountain of Hashem” (v.33) while it should have said “they traveled from the Mountain of God.” This teaches that they left like a child who runs off from school. It is also termed a punishment because they turned away from Hashem.<QC>
@d1Those gathered together .<TIE>.<TIE>. These are the pursuers.@bo Rashi is answering the question: The Torah should have written the opposite, because it is typical first to flee, and afterwards, out of fear for the pursuers, to disperse. But here it writes first “they will disperse.” Therefore Rashi explains that “they will flee” does not refer to those who will disperse. @ITR@it. @ITYaakov Triosh.@it @d1These are the haters of Yisroel.@bo (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) It appears to me that Rashi explained so because it is not possible to use the term “hate” toward Hashem. Nonetheless I do not know why he did not make this comment on the words “May your enemies disperse” which is written before. @ITKitzur Mizrochi@it answers that it is because the words “those who hate you have raised [their] heads” that is brought as a proof fits better with the words “those who hate you,” rather than “your enemies,” since there it does not mention enemies. @p1[36]@p2<TIE>Twenty-two thousand.@bo “Myriads” and “thousands” refer to two myriad and two thousand, for if not so, Scripture should say only “Come to rest Hashem, among the myriads of Yisroel,” because “a myriad” on its own always refers to ten thousand. And we do not find anywhere that Scripture mentions thousands in conjunction with myriads. @p1[1]@p2<TIE>“The People” refers only to the wicked.@bo You might ask: Do we not [also] find “the people” referring to the righteous, as it says “all of the people together answered and said: All that Hashem says we shall do and we shall hear” (Shemos 19:8). The answer is that when they are wicked the @ITonly@it name that they are given is “the people.” @d1Righteous, they are called “My people.”@bo You might ask: Do we not find “my people” referring to them when they are wicked, as it says “my people do not consider” (Yeshayah 1:3). The answer is that the verse means that @ITbeforehand@it they were my people, but @ITnow@it “they do not consider.” @d1How we have toiled.@bo @hh<HEB>לבטנו@ee<ENG> means “we have toiled.” @d1The distinguished among them.@bo You might ask: Rashi explained above that “the people” refers only to the wicked, while here he explains that it refers to the distinguished and the great ones. One cannot say that when he says “the distinguished .<TIE>.<TIE>. the great ones” he is referring to the wealthy ones among the wicked, who are thus termed “great,” because further on Rashi asks (v.16) “where were the original elders.<TIE>.<TIE>.?” He answers that they died at the fire of Taveirah, implying that those [who died] were the elders who were in Egypt — but these elders were righteous and leaders of the generation. The answer is that when the Torah writes “the people were .<TIE>.<TIE>. and the fire of Hashem burned among them” it refers to the wicked, “the people” written above. However, when the fire burned among them, it also burned among those who were not complaining. Thus when it writes “consumed some of the outcasts (lit. edge) of the camp” it refers to the distinguished and the great ones among them. Rashi is referring to these righteous ones when he comments later “in the fire of Taveirah they died.” @p1[2]@p2<TIE>Compared to a mortal king.@bo For if not so, the Torah should have said “they cried out to @ITHashem@it.” @d1Into its place.@bo (@ITKitzur Mizrochi@it) You might ask: If so, why did it not go upwards as is natural for fire. The answer is that Hashem showed them this in order that the fear of Heaven would always be upon them, lest they sin and the fire return to its previous form, to rise up and burn among them. @p1[4]@p2<TIE>And wept with them.@bo Rashi is answering the question: “Bnei Yisroel also began to weep” implies that the mixed multitude also wept, however it is not written that they cried. Therefore Rashi explains “Bnei Yisroel turned, also, and wept with them” meaning that the word “also” refers to “began to have strong cravings” — that the mixed multitude turned away from Hashem and craved meat. Then the Bnei Yisroel also turned and craved meat and afterwards wept with them, meaning that both wept together. @p1[5]@p2<TIE>Gave them fish.@bo It is commonly asked: What proof is this, perhaps the reason that they did not give them straw was because they said “they are lax<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” [Perhaps] they would have given them fish to eat. It appears to me that this is Rashi’s proof: How would Pharaoh’s decree to not give them any straw help to increase the burden of their work — perhaps they would buy straw from the Egyptians? Rather it is certain that Pharaoh knew that the Egyptians hated Yisroel and would not even sell them straw for money. Therefore, they certainly would not have given them [fish] for free. We need not ask: Does it not say in Maseches Sotah that when the women of Yisroel would go to draw water from the river Hashem would arrange for fish to be in their buckets? The answer is that were only complaining about large fish, in reference to this Rashi comments “perhaps you will say that the Egyptians gave them<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” referring to large fish. @d1Free of @BImitzvos.@bo Meaning that then our sustenance was not dependant upon [our] fulfillment of the mitzvos as it is now that our sustenance is the reward for our deeds. If we perform the mitzvos then the Land will bring forth its produce but if not then it will not bring forth its produce. However in Egypt our sustenance was provided for without any need for the fulfillment of the mitzvos. @p1[7]@p2<TIE>Round.@bo Rashi is answering the question: The manna was white, while coriander is black, therefore why did the Torah say that it was like coriander seed? Rather [it was shaped like coriander]. @p1[8]@p2<TIE>Rather [its taste] changed.@bo Since it is written that it was similar to crystal. For what advantage would there be if it were similar to crystal but then it was crushed in mortars and cooked in pots, it which case its consistency would change. Rather it never descended into the millstone.<TIE>.<TIE>. @d1The @BIlamed@BO is part of the root.@bo And the meaning of @hh<HEB>נהפך לשדי@ee<ENG> is [my moisture was overturned].<TIE>.<TIE>. @d1Kneaded, oil, honey.@bo Meaning a mixture of oil and honey. This is what is meant by the words written afterwards “like a loaf kneaded with oil and coated with honey.” @d1Leans towards Donash’s interpretation.@bo You might ask: Does it not lean more towards the interpretation that it is an acronym? The answer is that the acronym mentions honey but the Targum does not. @ITRe’m@it writes: Meaning that this is not like the interpretation of the Rabbis who explain it as a term meaning “breasts.” However, it is not to the exclusion of the interpretation that it is an acronym, which also leans towards the interpretation of Donash.<QC>
@p1[10]@p2<TIE>The intimate relations forbidden.@bo You might ask: Surely the intimate relations had already been forbidden to them, so why did they not weep before? The answer is that before the division into the camps, everyone was intermingled and therefore the intimate relations went unnoticed. However once they were divided into camps, each and every tribe was alone and the women from one tribe were not found among another, rather everyone was from the same tribe. Alternatively, before the division into the camps, all of the tribes were intermingled and people could commonly find other women who were not forbidden relations, thus they did not pay attention to the forbidden relations. However, once they divided and each tribe was left alone together with the forbidden relations, therefore they wept. This is not in accordance with the explanation of @ITRe’m@it who says that even though the entire Torah had been handed over to Moshe, it is possible that the passage of forbidden relations has not been told over to Yisroel until just before their departure from Mount Sinai. (@ITKitzur Mizrochi@it) explains in the name of the @ITMinchah Belulah@it that they combined the complaint about the forbidden relations with their complaint about the manna. For it says in the Midrash that the Omer-portion would disclose who’s son was a mamzer (a child born from illicit relations), since his Omer-portion would be found in the tent of his father. Thus they complained about the manna, but their main complaint was over forbidden relations. @p1[12]@p2<TIE>That You say to me.@bo The future tense is used in place of the present tense. But its meaning is not in the future tense as is implied, because if so, how did he know this. The word @hh<HEB>כי@ee<ENG> here is used in the sense of @hh<HEB>דהא@ee<ENG> (“that” in Aramaic) which has the sense of @hh<HEB>אשר@ee<ENG> (that). @d1That they stone you.@bo Meaning that you will suffer through them. @d1To carry them in my lap.@bo Rashi is answering the question: The verse implies “as a nurse carries an infant to the land,” but does a nurse carry an infant to the Land that You swore? He answers that “to the land” refers back to “carry it in your lap.”<QC>
@p1[15]@p2<TIE>Like a female.@bo The verse is explained as follows: “If this is the way” meaning that if You ultimately do this to Yisroel, then “You make me @hh<HEB>את@ee<ENG>” meaning that You would have made me like a female — because @hh<HEB>את@ee<ENG> (“you”) is used to address females, just as one says @hh<HEB>אתה@ee<ENG> (“you”) to males. The notation proves this, because there is a break between the words “the way” and “You.” It is impossible to say that it refers back to “I cannot<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (v.14) because the distress caused by the complaint would not have been so bad for him to say “please kill me.” Rather it was because of the punishment that Hashem would ultimately bring upon Yisroel that Moshe said this. @d1One of the “scribes’ adjustments.”@bo [Rashi] means to say that just as scribes emend their books when they write, Hashem also commanded Moshe to adjust the language when he wrote the Torah. @p1[16]@p2<TIE>The reply to your complaint.@bo For if not so, what is the relevance of this passage here being juxtaposed to the passage of the complaints.<QC>
@d1Like someone munching on his loaf while speaking.@bo Likewise they were eating and drinking while gazing at the Divine Presence. @d1Officers over them in Egypt.@bo For if this were not so, since they were already officers over the people why would he have to appoint them now? @p1[17]@p2<TIE>One of the ten descents.@bo You might ask: Why did Rashi explain this case more than all of the others. The answer is that the term “standing” was not written here like in the other cases. @d1I will make greater.@bo @hh<HEB>וארבי@ee<ENG> is an expression that denotes greatness.<QC>
@p1[18]@p2<TIE>Prepare yourselves for punishment.@bo For if not so, one could ask: Why did the Torah say “prepare yourselves” when it should merely have said “you shall say to the people: On the morrow you shall eat meat.” Furthermore what preparation is needed for eating? Rather it was [to prepare] for the punishment that is written later, which would come upon them through the eating of the meat.<QC>
@p1[20]@p2<TIE>This was the virtuous ones.@bo @hh<HEB>שמתמצין@ee<ENG> means “who fell ill.” @d1You are disgusted.@bo That you will be disgusted by it such that it will seem to you.<TIE>.<TIE>. @d1More readily than you welcomed.@bo The word @hh<HEB>זרא@ee<ENG> (repulsive) is used in the sense of “scattered” as in “behold he is winnowing” (Rus 3:2), but here the @ITaleph@it is interchanged with a @IThei@it. The meaning is that you will expel it from your mouths and nostrils, i.e., you will not even want to look at it, for you will cast it away entirely, more than you welcomed it originally. You might ask: How did Rashi know to explain “more than you welcomed it”? It appears that the word @hh<HEB>והיה@ee<ENG> (it will be) is superfluous, for the Torah should have stated “comes out of your nostrils, repulsive to you.” What is the meaning of “it will be”? It is obvious that if it comes out of your nostrils it will be repulsive to you. Therefore the word “it will be” alludes to another development, in addition to casting it away. Since it will come out from your nostrils, you will cast it away even further. If so this certainly indicates that you will cast it off further that you welcomed it, thus Rashi notes “it will be<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @ITR. Yaakov Triosh@it. @d1You would not have had the arrogance.@bo For if this were not so, why would the Torah have said “among you.” @p1[21]@p2<TIE>Those who went out.@bo (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) However those born in the desert did not weep, because they could not say “we remember the fish which we ate in Egypt.” Even though it is written “Bnei Yisroel also wept” [which seemingly implies they @ITall@it wept, nonetheless] Rashi still holds that those who were born in the desert did not weep. @p1[22]@p2<TIE>Now, which is worse?@bo One would have said that “will sheep and cattle” was worse than “listen here rebels,” meaning that if he was punished for that speech then all the more so he should have been punished for this. But why was he not punished? — since.<TIE>.<TIE>.<QC>
@p1[23]@p2<TIE>In a dispute.@bo @hh<HEB>הטפל@ee<ENG> means dispute.<QC>
@d1This is a compromise.@bo Meaning “you have come to make a compromise.” Perhaps He sent you because “He does not have<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1[26]@p2<TIE>And [left] two blank.@bo The text should read “He wrote ‘elder’ on seventy and left two of them blank,” meaning that afterwards he placed them in the container and mixed them together. You might ask: He should have merely taken twelve and written on ten “six elders” and on two “five elders. Then whoever chose the note saying “six” would chooses six elders from that tribe.<TIE>.<TIE>. (@ITGur Aryeh@it) The answer may be that if so, the tribe that chose the note saying “five” would be entirely disgraced, as if Hashem had not found favor with the entire tribe. However now, only those elders [picking the blank notes] would be disgraced. See @ITKitzur Mizrochi@it who asks further on this. See also the passage of the leaders (Bamidbar 3:50) and what I wrote concerning the redemption of the firstborn by the Levites. @p1[27]@p2<TIE>Some say that this was Gershom son of Moshe.@bo Since it is written “@ITthe@it youth,” which implies someone obvious, and there was no one more obvious than Gershom who was the firstborn son of Moshe.<QC>
@p1[28]@p2<TIE>And they will destroy themselves.@bo [Rashi] means to say that prophecy will automatically leave them, because the Divine Presence does not rest upon a person in the midst of mourning and burden. Similarly we find with Yaakov that “the spirit of Yaakov their father was revived” (Bereishis 45:28), and there Rashi explains that the Divine Presence rested upon him. @d1In prison.@bo Rashi explains in Parshas Beshalach on the verse “Choose men for us<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (Shemos 17:9) that “destroy them” means, destroy them from the world [for] they are liable to be destroyed. One must say that this is according to the other interpretation here, which explains [to “detain them” means] “detain them in prison<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” This is termed destruction because they would be incarcerated in a vault. @p1[29]@p2<TIE>One who grasps the bulk.@bo One who grasps the bulk of the burden and makes himself appear as if he is alone in carrying it. Similarly he has taken the matter to heart in order to avenge. @p1[30]@p2<TIE>From the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.@bo Since the implication of @hh<HEB>ויאסף@ee<ENG> ([Moshe] entered) implies that he was outside the camp. Therefore Rashi needed to explain “from the entrance to the Tent of Meeting” which was the camp of the Divine Presence and consequently outside Moshe’s camp — the camp of the Levites. @d1Everyone entered his tent.@bo Rashi is answering the question: The verse implies that Moshe and the elders of Yisroel entered the camp, i.e. that everyone went with him into his camp, the camp of the Levites. But were all of the seventy members of the Sanhedrin Levites? — Rather each one entered.<TIE>.<TIE>. @p1[31]@p2<TIE>Corresponded with his heart.@bo Rashi is answering the question: If they were laying one on top of the other as it is implied, wouldn’t the lower ones would die? @d1Neither to rise (nor to bend).@bo Meaning not to high, so that they not be troubled in collecting them. @p1[33]@p2<TIE>Before it was finished.@bo Meaning before it had been digested.<QC>
@p1[1]@p2<TIE>How did [Miriam] know.@bo Meaning: It is not the behavior of modest women to complain to their neighbors about their husbands concerning intimate relations. @d1Just as everyone.@bo For if this were not so, why is the Torah calling her a Cushite? Was she a Cushite? — surely she was a Midianite! Rather, just as a Cushite’s skin is unique, so too her skin was unique in its beauty. (@ITGur Aryeh@it) Because it is somewhat incongruous for the Torah to speak in this cryptic manner, Rashi therefore says that @hh<HEB>כושית@hh@ee<ENG> is the numerical equivalent of @hh<HEB>יפת תואר@hh@ee<ENG> “beautiful appearance.” @d1Concerning her divorce.@bo Meaning concerning her husband’s separation from her; this is an abbreviated verse. Why did Rashi reverse the order and explain first the words “the Cushite woman”? It appears that one may have thought that they spoke about him because he in fact married a Cushite woman, as the Midrash says; therefore Rashi first explains that @ITthe@it woman with a @IThei@it refers to Tziporah, while the word “Cushite” means that “just as<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Afterwards he explains that “concerning the woman” means concerning her divorce. Subsequently he again explains the word “Cushite” — “What does the Torah teach? — You find<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” And then he explains the word “@ITthe@it Cushite” — meaning the @IThei@it (indicating the definite article) — teaching “because of her beauty<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” This teaches that she appeared this way to everyone and was known for this, consequently the Torah writes “@hh<HEB>האשה הכושית@ee<ENG>” (lit. the Cushite the woman). Finally Rashi explains “for [he married a Cushite] woman” teaching why the Torah provided a reason. He explains that this means that he should have either not married or he should have remained with her and not have separated from her. @ITR. Yaakov Triosh@it. @p1[2]@p2<TIE>With him alone.@bo (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) Rashi was answering the question: The two words @hh<HEB>רק@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>אך@ee<ENG> are terms that indicate a limitation, thus the Torah should have said “@hh<HEB>הרק@ee<ENG> (was it only) with Moshe that He has spoken.<TIE>.<TIE>. Did He not also [speak] with us?” Rashi answers that “with him alone” [teaches], but not with others at all, whether they were as righteous as him, or whether they were less righteous than him. “Did He not also speak with us,” even though we are on a lower level of prophecy than Moshe? Therefore the Torah required two terms that indicate both facets of the limitation of speech. The Sifri suggests a similar answer. @p1[4]@p2<TIE>Suddenly when they were ritually unclean.@bo For if not so, why does Scripture write “suddenly”? @ITRe’m@it @d1Water! Water!@bo Because it is written here, “suddenly” and also concerning Nazirite it is written, “suddenly or unexpectedly” (Bamidbar 6:9). We make a comparison — just as a Nazirite needs to immerse in water, so too [the sudden call for water] was for immersion in water by day (following marital relations). @p1[5]@p2<TIE>He went alone.@bo For if not so, why does the Torah write “Hashem descended in a [pillar of] cloud”? Surely it had already stated “Hashem said: Come out, all three of you,” thus it should have merely said “and He stood at the entrance of the Tent<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” However in Parshas Ki Sisa where it is written “@ITHashem@it descended in a cloud” (Shemos 34:5), at the beginning of the revelation of the Divine Presence to Moshe in the morning, there one may say that it comes to inform of the revelation of the Divine Presence to Moshe, but not to teach that He descended alone with the pillar of Cloud as Rashi expounds here. @d1So that they would be drawn away.@bo (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) According to this, there is a difficulty: Since He did not speak to them in the presence of Moshe, why then did He call to Moshe and say “come out all three of you”? One must answer that it was in order that he would pray for Miriam immediately. (@ITKitzur Mizrochi@it) answers in the name of the @ITRamban@it that it was in order that Moshe would see Hashem’s zealousness on behalf of his honor. In the name of the @ITBaal@it @ITHaIkarim@it he answers that since they were not then ready for prophecy, for they had been somewhat ostracized, they would not have been able to receive the spirit of prophecy without Moshe. @p1[6]@p2<TIE>@HB<HEB>נא@ee@BO<ENG> is interpreted strictly as a request.@bo Meaning that even though Hashem’s anger flared against them and left, @hh<HEB>נא@ee<ENG> is nonetheless interpreted strictly as a request, and Hashem spoke to them gently. For if Hashem had spoken to them angrily, His words would not have been accepted. Thus one may learn a kal vachomer (a fortiori argument) to mortals; that they also should speak gently. @d1You will have.@bo The verse implies that the prophets will be Hashem, therefore Rashi explains “if you will have prophets” and that the word “Hashem” is read together with “I will make Myself known to him in a vision.” @d1The Divine Presence of My Name.@bo In saying “the Divine Presence of My Name” Rashi teaches that the meaning of “Hashem” is as if the Torah had said “I am Hashem.” For if not so, it should have said “@ITHe@it will make Himself known.” @p1[8]@p2<TIE>I told him to separate.@bo You might ask: We say (Shabbos 87a) that Moshe did three things on his own accord and Hashem agreed with him. One of these was that he separated from his wife, implying that Hashem did not command him to do so. See Tosafos Yevamos 82. @d1I am not aware.@bo You might ask: How did it occur to Hashem that Aharon and Miriam would speak in this way? The answer is that it was because they said “Is it only to Moshe that Hashem has spoken? Did He not also speak with us?” yet we have not abstained from marital relations. Why did Rashi add “.<TIE>.<TIE>. from marital relations”? — because it was a product of their haughtiness. They said “the Divine Presence rests upon him, but since Scripture writes “I will rest upon the contrite and the humble” (Yeshayahu 57:15), given that Moshe is haughty, why then does the Divine Presence rest upon him? It is as if Hashem is not aware that he is haughty.” Consequently Rashi says that this statement is worse than the first, and this is also why it is written here “the man Moshe was exceedingly modest” (v. 3) – in response to what Aharon and Miriam said that Moshe was haughty. @eeThis is in contrast to the explanation of @ITRe’m@it who expounds this from the extra @ITbeis@it of @hh<HEB>בעבדי@ee<ENG> (about my servant). However, this presents a difficulty: Why not expound the extra @ITlamed@it in @hh<HEB>לעבדך ליעקב@ee<ENG> “to your servant, @ITto@it Yaakov” (Bereishis 32:19) and also @hh<HEB>לאדוני לעשו@ee<ENG> “to my master, @ITto@it Eisav” (ibid. v. 5)? He brings a different [version of Rashi’s] text there in order to answer the difficulty, but according to our explanation it is not necessary to modify our version of Rashi.<QC>
@p1[12]@p2<TIE>Just as the dead cause ritual defilement when entering.@bo For it is written, “anything that comes into the tent and anything that is in the tent shall be defiled” (Bamidbar 19:14) and concerning the leper it is written, “that which comes into the house for all of the days of its confinement shall be defiled” (Vayikra 14:46). @d1It is unconscionable for a brother.@bo Meaning that even from its plain implication one can explain the verse without the need to say that the Torah uses euphemisms, by saying “@IThis@it mother” instead of “@ITour@it mother” and “@IThis@it flesh” instead of “@ITour@it flesh.” Thus their words were not directed towards their sister; rather he meant that generally any normal brother would not allow his sister to remain as if dead<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. @d1Who will confine her.@bo Thus the explanation of “let her not be like the dead” is that she has no hope. Given that she came from our mother’s womb, who will be able to confine her? Consequently it will emerge that half of our flesh will be consumed, since her flesh which is one with our flesh is being consumed and there is no remedy for her ailment. @p1[13]@p2<TIE>Answer me.@bo Because the word “saying” is superfluous and the Torah should have said “Moshe cried out to Hashem: Please God [please] heal.<TIE>.<TIE>.!” Rather Moshe said to Him “answer me,” similar to “Moshe spoke<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”<QC>
@p1[14]@p2<TIE>If her father.@bo Rashi adds the word “if” as if the Torah had said “if her father” because we do not find that her father ever spat in her face or that he rebuked her at any time. Rather the Torah means to say that “if her father were to spit<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” He adds “to display to her an angry face” to indicate that “spit” is not to be taken literally, only as reference to rebuke that would be a consequence of spitting. @d1Certainly, then, in the case of the Divine Presence — for fourteen days.@bo You might ask: Surely the kal vachomer can be applied for any number of days, so why did Rashi specifically mention fourteen days? (Niddah 31a) The answer is that the Rabbis say that there are three partners in [the formation of] a person — Hashem, his father and his mother — for the father and mother each give five things to the fetus and Hashem alone gives ten things. Thus we see that Hashem ‘creates’ half of the fetus. Another answer is that when a leper is closed off for seven days, if the affliction does not spread rather it remains stable, we close him off for another seven days. Then if it spreads he is definitely impure. Therefore Rashi mentioned fourteen days, which refers to definite impurity, meaning that it is fitting for her to be a metzora permanently. @p1[15]@p2<TIE>The one hour.@bo One may explain that this is because the attribute of goodness is five hundred times greater than the attribute of punishment. Thus Miriam, who waited for Moshe for a third of an hour was repaid with five hundred thirds of an hour — equaling seven days. They waited with her day and night for twenty four hours — and seven days and nights equal one hundred and sixty eight hours. This divided into thirds equals five hundred thirds. Though there are an extra four thirds in excess of the five hundred — the seven days — nonetheless, since it was not a complete day, only one and a third hours, this is insignificant. Furthermore it is also possible that in reward for going to call Moshe’s mother, another four thirds of an hour were added on for her. When Rashi says “one hour” he did not literally mean a whole hour, one out of the twenty-four hours in the day, rather “a period of time” meaning a third of an hour.<QC>
@p1[2]@p2<TIE>Why [is the chapter of the spies] adjacent.@bo Rashi is questioning why the chapter of the spies is adjacent only to the chapter of Miriam, for it should have been adjacent to the chapters of both Korach @ITand@it of Miriam. The Torah should have placed the dispute of Korach first, followed by the chapter of Miriam and afterwards the chapter dealing with the spies, for the dispute with Korach took place in Chatzeros while the affair with the spies took place [later] in Paran. He answers that it is “because she was punished<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” and therefore the chapters were not written in the order [that they happened] so that we learn this concept. If the chapters had been written in order, even if the incident with the spies would have been placed before Miriam, one would not have learnt this concept, because perhaps they were merely written in chronological order. @ITRe’m@it. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) I have already written on several occasions that Rashi does not give a reason for juxtapositions except where there is something superfluous, or a linguistic change, etc. which indicates that the Torah is particular about the juxtaposition. Similarly here, when the Torah writes “Moshe sent them from the desert of Paran” this is seemingly superfluous, for it is written above (12:16) “they camped in the desert of Paran” thus it is obvious that they were sent from there. Rather the Torah is certainly informing us of the place from where they were sent to teach us that even though they had traveled from Chatzeros and arrived at the desert of Paran, and they should have accepted reproof, nonetheless they sinned. This is in contrast to the explanation of @ITRe’m@it. @d1According to your opinion.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Surely it is evident to Hashem that they would sin through this dispatch. If so, why did Hashem command them to send the spies, which would cause punishment to come upon them so that they would not enter the Land of Israel, but die in the desert? In response Rashi answers that “I am not commanding you.” @ITRe’m@it explains that Rashi is expounding this from the word “send” and not from the word “for yourself.” Since it is written “all of you approached me and said let us send men before us<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (Devarim 1:22), it is certain that Moshe conferred with Hashem and that the reply came that they should be sent. It is evident that this response was granting permission and not giving a command because it was a response to a question, which indicates granting permission rather than giving a command. Concerning the word “@hh<HEB>לך@ee<ENG>” (for yourself) one must either say that this is a manner of speech, as in “the rain has passed @hh<HEB>הלך לו@ee<ENG> (and gone)” (Shir Hashirim 2:11). Alternatively, one may expound that when Hashem saw that the spies would sin, He referred to them with Moshe’s name — “send for yourself.” However, when Hashem saw the elders, and that their actions would be correct, he called them after His name, as it states “gather seventy men for @ITMe@it” (Bamidbar 11:16) @ITRe’m@it. @d1Moshe conferred.@bo (@ITGur Aryeh@it) The Ramban asks: According to Rashi’s explanation that Moshe consulted with the Shechinah as to whether to send the spies, he also sinned because Hashem had said that the land was very good. Furthermore, we find written explicitly in Parshas Devarim (1:23) “the matter was favorable in my eyes,” but if so, why was it favorable in his eyes? The apparent explanation is that Yisroel certainly wanted to send the spies, for they wanted to spy out the route and the towns that they would encounter.” It is usual for someone who does not know the way to send out spies — this was a correct and conscientious attitude toward a mitzvah. Similarly, Moshe sent spies to Yazer, and Yehoshua sent two men to Yericho. Consequently Moshe said “it was favorable in my eyes.” However, Hashem who knows the thoughts of man understood their evil intent and said to Moshe “Send them if you wish .<TIE>.<TIE>. I have said to them<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” See there for further detail. @d1An opportunity for error.@bo As [our Rabbis] say “if one comes to defile we allow him.” (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) This does not mean that Yisroel would err in misunderstanding the spies’ words, rather that the spies would err. This refers to their statement “a land which consumes its inhabitants” (v. 32) where the spies erred, as Rashi explains there. @p1[3]@p2<TIE>With his permission.@bo Meaning that it was not by Hashem’s decree, for this was only of their own volition. One should not say that “by the word of Hashem” refers back to the word “them” (i.e., Moshe sent @ITthem@it), meaning that those sent were “by the word of Hashem” even though their sending was not, because nothing about their selection had yet been mentioned. Therefore how could the Torah say “[Moshe] sent them” which by implication refers back to those mentioned previously. On the contrary, the Torah should have said “by the word of Hashem” in reference to their journey. Rather, “them” is a general reference to the people mentioned, to teach that their dispatch would be of their own volition. @d1Refers to distinction.@bo Meaning that generally the term @hh<HEB>אנשים@ee<ENG> refers to distinction, when it comes as a description as in “you shall be strengthened and be a @ITman@it” (Melachim I 2:2). However when it does not come as a description, as in “the @ITmen@it said” (Bereishis 19:12), “the @ITmen@it who were at the entrance of the house” (ibid. v.11), “send for yourself @ITmen@it” (v. 2 above), all of these refer to regular men, not men of distinction. @ITRe’m@it. @d1At that time they were righteous.@bo (@ITKitzur Mizrochi@it) @ITMaharan@it raises a difficulty: Is it not written “Moshe called Hosheia .<TIE>.<TIE>. Yehoshua” (v. 16)? If so, even before their journey he sensed their wickedness. It appears to me that this is no difficulty, because Hashem had already said to him “send for yourself — according to your opinion” and they would be given the opportunity to err. If so, he certainly knew of their evil intent and designs. (@ITGur Aryeh@it) answers that [they were righteous] only then, to the exclusion of afterwards, because immediately after they were appointed their designs became evil.<QC>
@p1[16]@p2<TIE>May Hashem save you.@bo Thus “he called” is in the sense of a prayer, as in “And there Avram called in the Name of Hashem” (Bereishis 13:4), and the @ITlamed@it of @hh<HEB>ליהושע@ee<ENG> is in place of @hh<HEB>על@ee<ENG> (for). Rashi’s proof to expound in this manner is that if not so, what is the reason to name him here? (@ITGur Aryeh@it) There is a difficulty: Why did he pray for Yehoshua and not for Caleiv? But this is not a difficulty, because it is great disgrace for a person whose student does not act properly, for people will say “if he had not learned from his teacher to act in this manner, he would not have done these things.” @p1[17]@p2<TIE>This was the worst.@bo For Egypt is to the south of the Land of Israel, and one going from there to the Land of Israel is traveling northwards. One must therefore say that the “south” mentioned here is the south of the Land of Israel, and Chevron is there and it was set aside for the burial of the dead being the most inferior of places in the Land. @ITRe’m@it. @p1[18]@p2<TIE>Some countries.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Why did Moshe first mention “what the land is” when he should have first mentioned the people of the land, which was most important. Thus he explains that “the land” refers to the nature of the land — because “some countries<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” and this is the most important factor. @d1He gave them a sign.@bo For if not so, how would they know if they were strong or not? Therefore the verse writes (v. 19) “@hh<HEB>הבמחנים אם במבצרים@ee<ENG>” (lit. are they @ITin@it open) or are they @ITin@it fortified [cities]” which is the explanation of “if they are strong or weak.” However one should not explain it is a separate subject. You should also see if their cities are fortified or open, because if so the Torah should have written “@hh<HEB>המחנים אם מבצרים@ee<ENG>” (lit. are they open or are they fortified). The Targum also indicates this, translating it as @hh<HEB>הבפצחים@ee<ENG> (are they @ITin@it fortified [cities]). @ITRe’m@it writes that the statement “and how are the cities” (v. 19) refers back to the first subject of whether they are strong or weak, even though there is a break between them, and that this is common. @ITMaharam@it raises a difficulty: If fortified cities indicate that they are weak, why was Yisroel not happy with the spies report when they heard that the cities were fortified — meaning that they were weak? Another question is asked: If this was an accurate and proven sign, why did the spies say that the people were strong and the cities were fortified, without fear that they would be caught in a falsehood? And if it was not a clear sign, how could Moshe give it to them as a sign? One cannot say like @ITNachalas Yaakov@it that the sign referred to their residences — that if they live in open cities then they are strong — however the fortified cities were for beauty. For it is written “the nation is mighty .<TIE>.<TIE>. and @ITthe@it cities are fortified” (v. 28). [@ITThe@it cities] with a @IThei@it implies that they lived in them, for if not so, it should have said “and fortified cities” without a @IThei@it. A further question is asked: Why in each case did Moshe place for us first what was good, such as “is it fat?” or “is it good?” whereas concerning strength he first said “are they strong?” and afterwards he said “are they weak?” For if they were strong then it would not be easy to conquer them. It appears that one question is answered by the other. What was the reason that each question began with a @IThei@it — (is it/ are they.<TIE>.<TIE>.) and ended with @hh<HEB>אם@ee<ENG> (or.<TIE>.<TIE>.) such as “@hh<HEB>הטובה אם רעה@ee<ENG>” (@ITis it@it good @ITor@it bad) and likewise all the other questions? On the contrary, it should have either said “@hh<HEB>הטובה היא הרעה@ee<ENG>” (@ITis it@it good, @ITis it@it bad) both with a @IThei@it, or both with @hh<HEB>אם@ee<ENG> — “@hh<HEB>אם טובה אם רעה@ee<ENG>” ([is it] either good or bad). For a question prefaced by a @IThei@it is the same as using @hh<HEB>אם@ee<ENG>. Furthermore, why in the case of “@hh<HEB>החזק הוא הרפה@ee<ENG>” (are they strong or weak) did it use a @IThei@it for both the question and its opposite, rather than saying @hh<HEB>אם@ee<ENG>? The answer is that here he was only asking about a matter and its opposite, such as “is it good or bad” or “is it fat or lean” but he did not mention anything in between. Therefore it was necessary to begin with a @IThei@it and end with @hh<HEB>אם@ee<ENG>, given that @hh<HEB>אם@ee<ENG> is not as indicative of a doubt as is the @IThei@it preceding a question. For we often find that @hh<HEB>אם@ee<ENG> refers to something certain, as Rashi writes in Parshas Mishpotim (Shemos 22:24). Thus he ended with @hh<HEB>אם@ee<ENG> as if to say “you will see that if it is not fat, then it will be lean” the matter being almost certain such as “if it is not soft then it will be hard.” This indicates to us that Moshe only gave a sign that if they lived in open cities then they were certainly strong, given that they relied on their strength. However if they lived in fortified cities, it was possible that they were still strong and that the fortified cities were for beauty or grandeur. Thus he first asked if they were strong, referring to whether they lived in open cities. But he also concluded with the @IThei@it to indicate that even if they lived in fortified cities, it was appropriate to ask this question with a @IThei@it because perhaps they were strong and the fortifications were for beauty. However if he had began by asking “@hh<HEB>הרפה@ee<ENG>” (are they weak) it would have been more appropriate to say “@hh<HEB>אם חזק@ee<ENG>” (@ITor@it strong), because those who live in open cities are certainly strong. In this case (writing “are they weak” first) we would not have learned anything more, given that one would always has to start with a @IThei@it when inquiring about something that one does not know. @ITR. Yaakov Triosh@it. @p1[20]@p2<TIE>A righteous man.@bo For it is written afterwards “you shall strengthen yourselves, and you shall take some fruit of the land,” thus there were trees. @ITRe'm@it explains that if the land is fat then there would naturally be trees and he had already asked them if the land was fat or lean. Even though the Rabbis expounded that [the tree that] he was talking about [refers specifically to] Iyov (Bava Basra 15a), Rashi simply writes “a righteous man” because this is closer to the simple meaning of the verse. @d1First ripening.@bo Rashi is answering the question: The Torah should have stated “@hh<HEB>ביכור@ee<ENG> @hh<HEB>ענבים@ee<ENG>” (“first ripening of the grapes” rather than “@hh<HEB>ביכורי@ee<ENG> — first ripenings”). Therefore he explains that it refers to the days in which the grapes were first ripening, referring to the days in which they ripen but not implying a plural.<QC>
@p1[21]@p2<TIE>The length and width.@bo (@ITGur Aryeh@it) You might ask: Why did they go the length and width, for if they wanted to go throughout the whole land, they would still not have gone everywhere? [The answer is that] one sees that the land is different along its length and width, because the eastern or western reaches are different, as are the northern and southern. Therefore, they traveled in this manner to see all of the differences. @p1[22]@p2<TIE>At the grave of the Patriarchs.@bo For if not so, why would he have gone to pray there instead of praying in another place. Rather one must say that it was because of the graves of the patriarchs. @d1Built up.@bo Rashi uses the word @hh<HEB>מובנה@ee<ENG> (lit. built up) which has the connotation of proliferation as in “and I will also be built (bear children) through her” (Bereishis 16:2).@hh<HEB>שנים @ee<ENG> (years) has the connotation of times, meaning that Chevron was seven times better than Tzo’an in Egypt. @d1This informs you.@bo A question is widely asked: Even according to the simple understanding of the verse there is a question as to what the verse is coming to teach you. The answer is that Rashi’s words here mean “Now [that I have explained this] the verse is easily understood<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Because according to the simple understanding there is a difficulty as to the significance of it being built seven years before, but according to the Midrashic explanation it is understandable that seven “informs you<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @d1Barren.@bo Boulders. Indicating a barren land which produces no fruit, as does a fertile land. @p1[23]@p2<TIE>With a cluster of grapes hanging from it.@bo [The meaning is] as if Scripture had written “from there they cut off a branch @ITwith@it one cluster of grapes” rather than interpreting [that they cut off] “a branch” by itself and a “cluster” by itself; for if so why would they have cut off the branch at all, since it had no fruit. @d1Do I not know that it was with two?@bo Meaning that when it is written “they carried it,” it implies that there were two, given that the minimum number of plural (i.e. they) is two. Why then does the Torah say “two”? The reason why Rashi did not explain this on the verse (apparently, in the text of Rashi that the Sifsei Chachomim had, this is a continuation of Rashi’s previous comment), is because one would have said that “two” refers to the branch — that they carried the branch on one pole and the cluster of grapes on another. However according to the explanation that there was a branch with a cluster of grapes hanging from it, one concludes that the branch and the cluster are one. Therefore there is a difficulty as to why is it written “two,” and Rashi answers that it was with two poles. @d1Eight took the cluster.@bo Meaning that when Moshe said “take from the fruit of the land” (v. 20) it implied that they should take some of every fruit, so why did they only take three types, as the Torah writes “one cluster of grapes .<TIE>.<TIE>. some figs and some pomegranates.” Rather it is certain that “eight took one cluster<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Rashi then explains why they did not take from every fruit, for surely Moshe had said to take from all of the fruit. He explains that it was “since the sole purpose of the others<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” For if they had not intended to deliver a slanderous report, they should not have taken a whole cluster of grapes, and they would have been able to take all of the [other kinds of] fruits of the land, or they should not have taken a cluster at all. You should know that they intended to deliver a slanderous report, because we say in the Gemara (Sotah 34a) that “if you want to know [how much one of them weighed]<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” But one could ask: What can you learn from the stones that that they erected in Gilgal? Perhaps there is a difference and here they were not carrying a load commensurate to their strength. Rather it is certain that the inference here is because if they had not carried commensurate to their strength, why did they take only three types of fruit? Thus it is certain that they intended to deliver a slanderous report. @ITRe’m@it quotes the Gemara and Rashi in Maseches Sotah which explain all of this.<QC>
@p1[26]@p2<TIE>To compare their going.@bo (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) Rashi explains in the Gemara (Sotah 35a) that “they went” is apparently superfluous, and given that it is written “and came,” Scripture should have merely said “they came to Moshe.” The explanation of his comment is that since the Torah had already recounted that “they returned from spying the land” (v. 25), why does it now mention their departure? Rashi answers that is was “to compare<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @d1To Moshe.@bo You might ask: What is Rashi’s source? Perhaps they brought it back even to Yisroel! The answer is that if “them” here refers back to “the entire congregation of the Bnei Yisroel” mentioned above, why is it necessary to repeat “and to the entire congregation” afterwards. @p1[27]@p2<TIE>Some truth.@bo For if not so and their intention was only for the bad, why did they start with something that was the opposite of their intention. Rather one must say that “a falsehood<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1[29]@p2<TIE>Because they had been burned by Amalek.@bo Even though it was true that they dwelled there, as it is written “the Amaleki and the Cana’ani dwell in the valley<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (Bamidbar 14:25). Rashi infers this because the Torah writes “go up by the mountain” (v. 17) and it was the Emori and the Chiti who dwelled there. Thus, since the Emori and Chiti dwelled in the mountain, while Amalek dwelled in the valley, they should not have mentioned Amalek first. Rather it was “to frighten them<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”<QC>
@p1[30]@p2<TIE>Them all.@bo Even though the verse explicitly says “the people,” [so why does Rashi mention it]? There is another difficulty: The verse does not mention that the people spoke up! The answer is that Rashi refers to the spies, meaning that he silenced all the spies, so that they would not speak at all, in order that the people would hear what Caleiv would say about Moshe. @d1The listener.@bo Since it is written “because he possessed in him a different spirit” (Bamidbar 14:24), it implies that there were two spirits, one in his mouth and one in his heart. To the spies he said “I am with you in your plan” but in his heart he said the truth. Consequently he was able to silence them. However @ITRe’m@it explains that it was because Caleiv called Moshe “son of Amram” rather than calling him by name that they thought he was with them. He referred to Moshe in this way so that they would err and think that his intention was to slander. @d1Even to heaven.@bo For if not so, Scripture should have said “@hh<HEB>נעלה וירשנו@ee<ENG>” (we can go up and we shall possess it), why did it need to add the word @hh<HEB>עלה@ee<ENG> (using the repetitive phrase “@hh<HEB>עלה נעלה@ee<ENG>” lit. we can go up, go up). Rather this means that we can go up to anywhere, even to heaven. (@ITGur@it @ITAryeh@it) You might ask: Why did they speak about overcoming them, surely they were not in heaven? The answer is that this is what they were saying: Even if they have in heaven a great celestial power supporting them, such that we would not be able to expel them, we can still go up. Because celestial powers do not affect Israel, for they override the celestial powers. Thus we can surely go up and overcome their celestial powers. @p1[31]@p2<TIE>About the One above.@bo Since it is written “@hh<HEB>כי חזק @hhהוא@hh ממנו@ee<ENG>” (for @eehe/it@ee is more powerful than we) while it should have written only “@hh<HEB>כי חזק ממנו@ee<ENG>” [i.e. the word ‘“@hh<HEB>הוא@ee<ENG> — he/it”’ is superfluous and can be expounded]. Also, above (v. 28), [in reference to the nation], the word @hh<HEB>הוא@ee<ENG> (he/it) is not written, only “@hh<HEB>אפס כי @ee<ENG>$@hh<HEB>אז העם@ee<ENG>” (however the nation is mighty). Therefore, [the word “@hh<HEB>הוא@ee<ENG> – he/it” that is written here] refers to “the One above<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (@ITGur Aryeh@it) It is impossible to say that [the phrase “more powerful] than we” refers to Israel, since this would imply that Israel were also strong and only that they are stronger. This would be similar to Rashi’s explanation on the verse “[greater] and more powerful than you” (Devarim 9:1), that you are powerful but they are even more powerful than you. But here this explanation is improbable, because the spies likened themselves to locusts in relation to the people who lived in the Land. Rather, “[they said it] about the One above.” @p1[32]@p2<TIE>Burying the dead.@bo Rashi’s inference is because it is written “the land through which we have passed .<TIE>.<TIE>. is a land which consumes,” but the words “the land through which we passed” are apparently superfluous; for this is not the beginning of their statement, such that they need to state which land they were referring to. Therefore Rashi explains that wherever we passed we saw that it was consuming its inhabitants — because they were burying the dead. @ITR. Yaakov Triosh@it @p1[33]@p2<TIE>Who fell.@bo As the Torah writes (Bereishis 6:2), “the sons of the lords saw the daughters of man<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” For if not so, why is “@hh<HEB>הנפילים@ee<ENG>” (the giants) written twice? Rather it is certain that the second term “@hh<HEB>הנפילים@ee<ENG>” literally means fallen (from the root @hh<HEB>נפל@ee<ENG> — to fall), and there we saw those who fell from heaven, Shamchazai and Azael. @d1Say to each other, “there are ants.”@bo There many who find difficulty with this statement: It is written “and so we appeared” which implies “like grasshoppers,” while Rashi explains that we heard them saying “there are ants.” @ITRe’m@it amends Rashi’s words to read “grasshoppers…” However this does not appear correct, firstly because in every text it is written “ants.” Furthermore, if they were truly “like grasshoppers” when comparing their relative sizes, the comparison being that a hundred grasshoppers piled on each other reach the height of a person, and similarly the giants were the height of a hundred people. If so the Torah should have been brief and merely written “we were like grasshoppers in comparison to them.” Why did it add “and we were [like grasshoppers] in our eyes” which merely reflects how they appeared. Furthermore, there is a difficulty: Did the giants not see that all of the other inhabitants of the land were not giants, and if so why did they say “there are ants in the vineyards like people” as if they had never seen people other than giants like themselves. The answer is that it is a known phenomenon that one who looks down from a height, sees an object as being smaller than one who is standing on the ground and looking at the same object that is high up. The reason is that the sense of vision is like a flame, and it is the nature of a flame to rise and bring the object being viewed towards the eye. Thus, neither of them sees the object according to its actual size. The spies intended to deliver a slanderous report with each and every statement, thus they said “all the people that we saw there were men of great stature,” meaning that they are not used to small people like us. Then they said “we were like grasshoppers in our eyes” meaning that we were standing below and looking at the height of the giants, and we measured ourselves in comparison to them as the size of a grasshopper in comparison to a man. But in truth we were even smaller than this because we were looking upward and thus misrepresented their height. They concluded “and so we appeared in their eyes” meaning that according to the error that we made in looking up from a low position, to measure ourselves as being larger that than our true size, so too the giants erred in looking down from a height to measure us as being smaller than reality. Thus we were not considered like anything in their eyes, only as ants. Consequently they do not fear us at all, even though we are 600,000. Now there is a difficulty: Perhaps they knew how to measure correctly and did not err. If so what is meant by “and so [we appeared]?” Also perhaps Hashem made us appear large in their eyes. Therefore Rashi explains that we heard them saying “there are ants.” @ITR. Yaakov Triosh@it @d1Who make the sun a necklace.@bo Rashi in the Gemara explains “as if their necks extended through the ‘window’ through which the sun emerges.” He explains “who made the sun a necklace” as meaning that the opening through which the sun is viewed became like a necklace around their necks. One might ask why Rashi did not make this comment above on the verse “we also [saw] the offspring of the giant ($)” (v. 28). The answer is that their forefather may have been called @hh<HEB>ענק@ee<ENG> (giant) and thus they were called the sons of the giant ($) after him, similar to the term “the sons of Noach ($)” we apply to all mankind. But here it is written “there we saw the @hh<HEB>נפילים@ee<ENG> (lit. fallen ones).” Rashi has a difficulty as to why they were so called, and said that it must have been because they were they sons of Shamchazai and Azael. And if so, there is a difficulty as to why they were called “the sons of the @hh<HEB>ענק@ee<ENG> (giant),” rather it must be because they make [the sun] a necklace (@hh<HEB>ענק@ee<ENG>). (See Tosafos Succah 22). @p1[2]@p2<TIE>Would that we had died.@bo Meaning that it is not in the sense of “if” as in “would that I had a sword in my hand” (Bamidbar 22:29) and “would that they were wise” (Devarim 32:29). Rashi uses the word @hh<HEB>הלואי@ee<ENG> which has the sense of “would that<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” It takes a @ITvav@it afterwards similar to “@hh<HEB>מי יתן @hhו@hhהיה לבבם@ee<ENG>” (would that it was in their hearts” (Devarim 5:26), therefore Rashi needed to add in the @ITvav@it — @hh<HEB>הלואי @hhו@hhמתנו@ee<ENG> as if it had read “would that we had died.”<QC>
@p1[9]@p2<TIE>Consequently “and you<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”@bo With this Rashi makes sure that you do not say that these are two independent ideas. Rather one is the resultant of the other, meaning that if you do not rebel against Hashem, consequently you will not have to be afraid. @d1Like bread.@bo As if it had stated “they are as our bread.” @d1Their shield.@bo Because a person’s shield provides him with protection (shade), a shield is termed “a shade.” @p1[10]@p2<TIE>@d1Yehoshua and Caleiv.@bo Not Moshe and Aharon, because they did not say anything. @d1The Cloud descended there.@bo To absorb the arrows and stones. Rashi wished to answer the question: Surely the glory of Hashem constantly rested upon them, over the Ark-cover between the Cheruvim. @p1[11]@p2<TIE>To what degree.@bo But not “to which place” which is normally the meaning of “until where.” @p1[12]@p2<TIE>As Targum Onkelos renders it meaning annihilation.@bo Meaning “eradication from the world.” It is not an expression denoting inheritance (@hh<HEB>ירושה@ee<ENG>). Rashi also explains like this further on (v. 24). @d1Perhaps you will ask, “What will I do<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”@bo For if not so, what would its relevance be here. Was Hashem making an arrangement with him that He would make Moshe into a greater nation if he allowed Him to kill them? There are those who ask: Concerning the golden calf in Parshas Ki Sisa (Shemos 32:10) where it is also written “I shall make you into a greater nation,” Rashi explains “if a chair with three legs [cannot stand before you at a time of anger]<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (v. 13). The answer is that here Rashi is answering the question: Why did the Torah write “stronger than they”? It must have been in order to remove the argument that “a chair with three legs” meaning that your descendants will be like a chair with four legs. Since you are descended from the patriarchs it will have three legs, and your merit will provide the fourth leg. Alternatively @hh<HEB>ממנו@ee<ENG> (than he/they) refers back to Avraham who is the beginning of the lineage, and therefore your descendants will have four legs. However above the Torah does not write “than they,” which implies that the lineage would begin anew with Moshe — meaning that they would be called the children of Moshe rather than the children of Avraham, Yitzchak and Yaakov. In response to this Moshe said “can a chair with three legs<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” If one investigates thoroughly he will see that this explanation answers many questions. (@ITDivrei Dovid@it) I say that this question is not based on any logic. For in Parshas Ki Sisa only the merit of the patriarchs is mentioned, as Rashi there writes “if they are not saved in [the patriarchs’] merit, why do You say “I will make you [into a great nation] .<TIE>.<TIE>. can a chair<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” However here it does not refer to merit, rather it refers to the oath given to the patriarchs, as Rashi explains. Thus if you ask: “What will I do about the oath given to the patriarchs,” one can easily answer that “I shall make you into a greater nation for you are descended from them” and thereby the oath would be fulfilled. Consequently it appears clear to me that there is no need to ask “can a chair<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1[13]@p2<TIE>That You killed them.@bo They will not hear that You brought them up, as would be understood from the simple reading of the verse; rather they will hear about their being killed. Thus the word “@hh<HEB>כי@ee<ENG>” here is in place of “@hh<HEB>אשר@ee<ENG>” (that). It is as if the Torah had said “Egypt will hear that You in your might have brought up this people from among them” and having seen the great unbounded love, they will not say [that their being killed is because] they sinned, rather that @ee“It is because of [Hashem’s] inability<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (v. 16).<QC>
@p1[15]@p2<TIE>Suddenly.@bo (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) There is a difficulty: In Parshas Vayechi it is written “because in their anger they killed a man” (Bereishis 49:6), and Rashi explains “this was Chamor and the people of Shechem who were only considered like one man.” Furthermore: When Rashi writes that as a result “the nations will say” this implies that specifically if they were to die suddenly, the nations would say so. However if they were not to die suddenly then they would not. What is the difference? It appears that one question is answered by the other. In Parshas Vayechi there would be no difference if they were killed suddenly or not, therefore Rashi was forced to say that the people of Shechem were only considered like one man. However here where he wished to conclude that “as a result the nations will say<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” this would be understandable if they were to die suddenly in an unnatural manner, then they would know that it was through the hand of Hashem. However, if they were to die one at a time then they could say that they died naturally and thus the nations would not say .<TIE>.<TIE>. You should know that after Moshe’s prayer, Hashem said “I have forgiven them as you said.” Subsequently they died one at a time, and the nations did not say anything.<QC>
@p1[16]@p2<TIE>This is an abstract noun.@bo [It is] not a verb in the feminine form. However [the word Hashem] lacks a @ITlamed@it, and it is as if Scripture had stated “[lack of] ability of Hashem.” @p1[17]@p2<TIE>By fulfilling your word.@bo Moshe did not request anything new [of Him], only to fulfill His word. This is what is meant by “as You spoke.”<QC>
@p1[18]@p2<TIE>Those who repent.@bo You might ask: Surely this verse is also written in Parshas Ki Sisa (Shemos 34:7) and there Rashi explains the entire verse. The answer is that here he only explains the word “acquits” in order that one not question Rashi’s earlier comment “slow to anger” which meant both to the righteous and to the wicked. However here it writes “acquits” meaning the righteous “but does not acquit” meaning the wicked. Thus Rashi explains that He acquits those who repent but He does not acquit those who do not repent. @p1[20]@p2<TIE>Lest they say.@bo But not because of your “words” — because you prayed for them and said “Please forgive<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (v. 19). For if not so, what is meant by “just as you spoke”? Surely “I have forgiven them” [alone] would be sufficient! @p1[21]@p2<TIE>As I live.@bo There are texts that read “As I live is an expression that denotes an oath.” Just as I live and My glory @ITfills@it all the earth, so I shall fulfill to them “for all the people<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” However afterwards these texts do not read “if they will see the Land, and My Glory will fill all the earth, so that My Name will not be desecrated through this plague<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” These texts explain “and the Glory of Hashem fills<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” as meaning “just as My Glory fills the entire land,” similar to the understanding of @ITIbn Ezra@it. According to this explanation there is no need to rearrange the passage (see Rashi’s comment to v. 23). However according to the text that we have written before us, “if they will see<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” the passage should be rearranged as follows: “As I live, for all the men<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” These texts explain “and the Glory of Hashem fills<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” in the future tense (@ITwill@it fill.<TIE>.<TIE>.), like the second explanation given by @ITIbn Ezra@it. Thus it is necessary to rearrange the passage and explain “My Glory will fill all the earth, so that My Name will not be desecrated through this plague,” all in the future tense. According to this explanation one has to omit the words above “and My Glory will fill all the earth” and to merely read “as I live, so shall I fulfill for them<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @ITRe’m@it writes that the passage should be rearranged. The words “the Glory of Hashem will fill” should be at the end of the entire passage since they are related to the oath. And afterwards, “Hashem says ‘Why do I delay punishing them — so that My Glory will fill all the earth and My Name will not be desecrated among the nations — to consider Me as not having the ability.’” This explanation is according to the texts that we have before us. @p1[22]@p2<TIE>Twice at the sea.@bo This is the language of the Gemara in chapter @ITYesh Be’arachin@it (Arachin 15a): It was taught in a Beraysa: Our forefathers tested Hashem ten times. Twice at the sea, twice with the manna, twice with the quail, twice with the water, once with the golden calf and once at the desert of Paran. The explanation is as follows: Twice at the sea: Once when they descended to the sea, as it is written “is it because there were no graves in Egypt…?” (Shemos 14:11). Once when they ascended as it is written “and they rebelled at the sea of Reeds” (Tehillim 106:7); this teaches that Yisroel were rebelling at that moment saying “just as we came up from this side, the Egyptians are coming up from the other side.” Twice with the water: At Marah as it is written “they came to Marah .<TIE>.<TIE>. and the people complained against Moshe” (Shemos 15:23-24). And at Rephidim as it is written “they camped at Rephidim and there was no water for the congregation to drink, and the people argued with Moshe” (Shemos 17:1). Twice with the manna: As it is written “Do not go out” but they went out (Shemos 16:26-27). And “do not leave over” but they left over (Shemos 19:20). Twice with the quail: Firstly “when we were satiated over the fleshpots” (Shemos 19:3). And secondly “the mixed multitude that was among them” (Bamidbar 11:4). With the golden calf, as it is written (Shemos chapter 32). And at the desert of Paran, which Rashi explains as a reference to the incident dealing with the spies. @p1[23]@p2<TIE>They will not see.@bo (@ITGur Aryeh@it) For it is certain that they will not see, since there is never any doubt before Hashem. @p1[24]@p2<TIE>Two spirits, one verbal and one in his heart.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Did only Caleiv have a different spirit? Surely Yehoshua also had a spirit different from that of the spies! To this he explains that he had “two spirits<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”<QC>
@d1According to what was in my heart.@bo Rashi is obliged to bring proof from the prophets so that you should not question his source that he had one spirit in his mouth and another in his heart. For perhaps he had another spirit both in his mouth and in his heart; and not that he said to them “I am with you in your plan.” Thus Rashi explains that this is what was said in the book of Yehoshua “I brought back word to him according to what was in my heart” but not according to what was in my mouth. @d1He followed me full-heartedly.@bo The words “[in] his heart” is missing from the text, because if not so, what is meant by “he followed Me fully”? Surely he was with the spies in his mouth though not in his heart. @d1Chevron will be given to him.@bo Meaning that “I shall bring him” which was mentioned in the verse is understood as “I will give him” and the meaning of “into the land” is to Chevron. The meaning of “to which he came” refers to when he came to spy out the land. The verse is not implying that he would be brought into the land and he would not die in the desert, as might be understood from this passage. @p1[25]@p2<TIE>They will kill you.@bo This teaches you the reason for the juxtaposition of “tomorrow turn” to “the Amaleki<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” which precedes it. Rashi adds the word “back” because without this it would appear that there were two routes by which to enter the Land, one by way of the valley and the other in the desert by way of the Reed Sea. However this is not so, for the desert by way of the Reed Sea was behind them and they had already traveled past it and have come to this encampment. Thus the meaning of “back” is that Hashem does not wish to bring you to the land, because He wants you to perish in the desert. @p1[27]@p2<TIE>These are the spies.@bo But not the whole of Yisroel, for the Torah writes “[who] provoke Me; the complaints of Bnei Yisroel” which implies those who caused Yisroel to complain. @d1That [a congregation] is ten.@bo There were twelve spies; without Yehoshua and Caleiv who were not part of the conspiracy there were ten who are referred to as a “congregation”. @d1The Israelites against me.@bo Rashi adds the word “Israelites” between the words “provoke” and “[against] me” in order that one not explain the word @hh<HEB>מלינים@ee<ENG> [translated as provoke [complaint] but which could conceivably mean “complain”] as referring to the spies. This is not true, because the spies delivered a slanderous report about the Land of Israel, but it was Yisroel who were complaining.<QC>
@p1[28]@p2<TIE>If it were possible to say, I do not live.@bo As if the Torah had said “If I do not do to you as you have spoken, that your corpses shall fall .<TIE>.<TIE>. then I do not live.” However the Torah did not write “I do not live” because the Glory of Hashem is hidden. Thus it relied upon this being understood by first having said “as I live.” For if not so, it should have said “‘As I live,’ says Hashem, ‘as you have spoken in My ears, so shall I do to you.’”<QC>
@p1[32]@p2<TIE>Bringing [the children] into the land.@bo Meaning that He had discussed the children, recounting that He would bring them into the land, however they [the adults] would die. Thus the word @hh<HEB>אתם@ee<ENG> “yours” was necessary to differentiate between one and the other.<QC>
@p1[33]@p2<TIE>Before the age of sixty.@bo The decree was only made upon those who were twenty years old and they were in the desert for forty years, thus it emerges that they were sixty years old [when they died]. Because even though they were to be punished by death, they were not liable for @ITkoreis@it [premature death before the age of sixty]. @d1The first year was included.@bo Meaning that the first year of the count [of forty] was included.<TIE>.<TIE>. @d1Part of the year as the whole.@bo Meaning that some of the people who were counted after the incident with the golden calf, which was after the first count [in the desert], had turned twenty years old. However, if initially they had been nineteen years old, and only at the sending of the spies did they turn twenty, they would enter the land. This is what Rashi means when he says “so that when they entered their sixtieth year, those who had been twenty years old died.” In the name of @ITMaharitz@it. @p1[34]@p2<TIE>You diverted your hearts.@bo The Torah calls the diversion of their hearts from Hashem, as ‘Hashem’s diversion from them’. Because given that they diverted their hearts from Hashem, He diverted Himself from them.<QC>
@p1[38]@p2<TIE>What does the Torah teach by saying “lived.”@bo Rashi is answering the question: In another verse (Bamidbar 26:65) the Torah writes “no man from among them was left, aside from Caleiv son of Yefuneh and Yehoshua<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1[41]@p2<TIE>Your actions.@bo The word “it” refers to an action in the feminine [form], as if the Torah had stated “this action that you are doing will not succeed.” @p1[43]@p2<TIE>Because you turned.@bo The meaning of @hh<HEB>על כן@ee<ENG> (for) is “since” [rather than “therefore”], which Rashi explains as @hh<HEB>על אשר@ee<ENG> (because). Given that it would be incorrect to say @hh<HEB>הואיל ושבתם@ee<ENG> (since you turned away) the Torah adds the formation “@ITverb .<TIE>.<TIE>. @it @hh<HEB>על כן@ee<ENG>” to the word @hh<HEB>כי@ee<ENG> which indicates causation — “since you did so<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” referring to you turning away from following Hashem. @p1[45]@p2<TIE>To commemorate this incident.@bo Meaning either that this was prophetic, or that Moshe used this name when he wrote down the Torah after forty years in the desert. By this time the place was already called Chormah.<QC>
@p1[3]@p2<TIE>This does not denote a command.@bo Meaning that if this were a command, it would not be correct to say “by verbalizing as a pledge or as a donation” because donations are not commanded. Thus Rashi explains that “when it occurs to you<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @d1Satisfying.@bo Not that Hashem receives satisfaction from the offering, for it is written (Tehillim 50:12) “Even if I were hungry I would not tell you<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” as explained above in Parshas Tetzaveh (Shemos 29:18, 25). The reason for Rashi commenting on “a pleasing fragrance” before “or on your festivals” is that he first explains that “when you make the fire-offering” does not refer to a command, rather when it occurs to you to make a fire-offering to provide a pleasing fragrance. Linked to this he also explained “a pleasing fragrance” before explaining “on you festivals.” @d1In order to fulfill the holiday obligation.@bo Rashi was forced to explain “or that you make<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” so that one would not understand this as “by verbalizing a pledge, or by verbalizing a donation or by verbalizing [an offering] on your festivals.” For this is not so, given that the offerings on the festivals are obligatory and thus not dependant upon verbalization. @p1[4]@p2<TIE>You should present libations and a meal-offering for each animal.@bo Meaning that even though I said above that the verse “when you make a fire-offering<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” was not referring to an obligation; nonetheless if you offer a pledge or a donation or an obligatory-offering on your holidays, you are obliged to offer libations and a meal-offerings with them. @d1With the oil absorbed.@bo Meaning that the kohanim do not eat from it like the other meal-offerings mentioned in Vayikra. Rather it is completely consumed and the oil is absorbed in it, instead of being brought separately. @d1And the wine [is poured] into the bowls.@bo There were two perforated silver bowls on the altar. The kohein would pour the wine and the water in the mouths of these bowls and the libations would flow down onto the top of the altar. On the altar there was a hole through which the water and wine would go down to the foundations of the altar which were hollow and extremely deep. @p1[6]@p2<TIE>If it is a ram.@bo Meaning that if it is a ram, you should make its meal-offering of two-tenths instead of the one-tenth for a sheep, also one-third of a hin of wine and oil instead of the quarter for a sheep. Thus one makes more for the ram than for the sheep. Here the meaning of @hh<HEB>או@ee<ENG> (lit. or) is @hh<HEB>אם@ee<ENG> (if), not the literal understanding of “or” which would imply that the sheep and the ram were the same. @d1The palgas.@bo Meaning that until twelve months it is called a sheep, while from thirteen months onward it is called a ram. Thus from twelve months until thirteen months and one day I would not know whether it was considered a ram or a sheep regarding libations — whether it required the libations of a sheep or the libations of a ram. At this stage it is called a palgas. Therefore the Rabbis expound the word @hh<HEB>או@ee<ENG> to teach that it requires the libations of a ram. The name “palgas” is derived from two words “plag” (divided) “gas” (large) meaning that it is removed from being fully-grown and being referred to as a ram. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) The entire passage is explained in chapter@IT Shtei Middos@it (Menachos 91b) but it appears to me that @ITRe’m@it overlooked this.<QC>
@p1[12]@p2<TIE>According to the number of animals.@bo The verse is ambiguous, writing “according to the number” but not explaining which number, whether the animals or the libations. Furthermore, it repeats itself and writes @hh<HEB>תעשו@ee<ENG> (you offer/make) twice. Thus Rashi explains that “according to the number” refers to the animals. The first @hh<HEB>תעשו@ee<ENG> ([which] you offer) refers to the offerings while the second @hh<HEB>תעשו@ee<ENG> ([so shall] you make) refers to the libations. He also explains @hh<HEB>לאחד@ee<ENG> “for one” as meaning for each and every one and the second “according to their numbers” as meaning that the number of animals and libations should be equal.<QC>
@p1[15]@p2<TIE>Like me, like you.@bo (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) Rashi had to expand upon and bring proofs to his explanation because normally the two @ITkafs@it would come to equate the two things @ITtogether@it, not merely to equate @ITone@it to the @ITother@it. This is not so here where Rashi explains that they will be like you, but it is not possible to explain the other way, that you shall be like the proselyte. Thus he brings a proof from the verse “Like Hashem’s garden, like the land of Egypt” which means that so is the land of Egypt. There too, it is impossible to explain the other way — “like the land of Egypt so too is the land of the garden of Hashem” because the garden of Hashem is certainly greater than the land of Egypt. Similarly with “like me, like you” regarding Yehoshafat and Yehoram one can not explain the other way around and nonetheless Scripture writes it with two @ITkafs@it.<QC>
@p1[20]@p2<TIE>For which no specific amount is required.@bo Meaning that a single grain exempts the entire silo, given that the Torah merely says “the first of your grain-harvest” (Devarim 18:4). @d1For which a specific amount is required.@bo The terumah taken from ma'aser does have a specific amount, one se'ah from ten. @p1[21]@p2<TIE>The first of the loaves.@bo Meaning that if one had ten portions of dough then one would have to give the entire first portion for the challah-offering, “the Torah therefore teaches<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” You might ask: If so, why does it say (v. 20) “@hh<HEB>ראשית@ee<ENG> (the first portion) of your doughs”? The answer is that if the Torah had only stated “@hh<HEB>מראשית@ee<ENG> (of the first portion) of your doughs” one would have said that if one had twelve portions of dough, one would have to give a portion of the first, but that the others were exempt. Therefore it wrote “the first portion of your dough” to teach that one must give a part of the entire dough. @ITRe’m@it raises a difficulty: Here we learn from the word @hh<HEB>מראשית@ee<ENG> (of the first portion) that one gives “part of it but not all of it.” However, concerning the first-fruits we learn from the word @hh<HEB>מראשית@ee<ENG> that one gives some of the first [fruits] but not all of them — that not all fruits are liable for the first-fruits offering, only the seven species, as is explained by @ITRambam@it and @ITRashi@it in Parshas Ki Savo (Devarim 26:2). Consequently, why do we not say, like here, that the fruit that ripens first are not all liable for the first-fruit offering, only one grape-cluster or one grape? He leaves this as a question both according to @ITRambam@it and @ITRashi@it. It appears to me that in the case of challah there is another qualification. The Torah writes, (v. 19) “when you eat from the bread of the land<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” There is a difficulty as to why it had to say “the land” given that above (v. 18) it wrote “at your coming to the land.” Rather, it must come to teach that one is only liable for challah with produce for which the Land of Israel is praised — the five species of grain. If so, the word @hh<HEB>מראשית@ee<ENG> is left superfluous in order to expound that not all of the dough is liable, only part. However this would not be the case there where there is no superfluous wording. @d1An amount sufficient for “giving.”@bo (@ITGur Aryeh@it) Even though Rashi previously explained that there is no specific amount. The answer to this difficulty is that here he refers to a mitzvah [to give more]; however it would certainly be considered a challah-offering even if one gave less than the amount sufficient for “giving.”<QC>
@p1[22]@p2<TIE>To indicate that it requires an ox as a burnt-offering and a goat as a sin-offering.@bo But not an ox as a sin-offering, as [is the case] with someone who mistakenly transgressed any of the other mitzvos. Thus we have learned that the mistaken transgression of idol worship is not included with the other mistake transgressions; meaning that if it was not for this passage one would have thought that idol worship was included. However this passage teaches that it is not. (@ITGur Aryeh@it) You might ask: Let us learn the case of idol worship from the other transgressions and oblige him to bring an ox as a sin-offering. Since for other transgressions where one does not bring an ox as a burnt-offering, one does bring an ox as a sin-offering, in the case of idol worship where one brings an ox as a burnt-offering one should certainly bring one as a sin-offering. @ITSifri@it answers that the Torah writes “you shall make @ITone@it young ox as a burnt-offering” meaning one for a burnt-offering but not as a sin-offering, given that it does not write “you shall make @ITan@it ox as a burnt-offering.” @d1A single commandment .<TIE>.<TIE>. idol worship.@bo Because it is written (v. 24) @hh<HEB>נעשתה@ee<ENG> (“having been done” in the singular form), which implies a single transgression. @d1And brazenly defies.@bo He expounds @ITaggados@it fallaciously, for example [he says that] “Moshe should not have written ‘the sister of Lotan was Timna’ (Bereishis 36:22)” (Sanhedrin 99b). @d1We heard from the mouth of the Omnipotent.@bo The Torah writes “which Hashem said to Moshe” and it writes “all that Hashem commanded Moshe” which implies that the command was through Moshe. However it is written “which Hashem said” which implies that it was His speech, and that Yisroel heard it from His mouth when he spoke to Moshe. If so, which commandment was both by the word of Hashem and also through Moshe — one must say that it was “I am<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” and “you must not have” which we heard from the mouth.<TIE>.<TIE>. @p1[24]@p2<TIE>And ruled that one of the forms of service.@bo The Torah writes in Parshas Vayikra (4:13) “a matter was hidden” which implies that only one aspect was hidden, but not the entire matter. They knew that it was forbidden to worship idols, only they did not know that this [particular] form of service was a forbidden. Alternatively we learn a gezeirah shavah (scriptural comparison) between the word @hh<HEB>דבר@ee<ENG> (matter) here and @hh<HEB>דבר@ee<ENG> in the verse “if a matter is hidden from you<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (Devarim 17:8), which implies “and not the entire matter.” @p1[25]@p2<TIE>The ox as the olah-offering.@bo [Rashi says this] so that you do not understand the words “they have brought their offering” as meaning the olah-<FJ> offering and sin-offering. And that when it is written “and their sin-offering” it refers to the ox sin-offering mentioned in Vayikra. Consequently, the verse here would come to say that aside from the ox olah-offering and the goat sin-offering that are mentioned in this passage, they also brought the ox sin-offering that was mentioned in Vayikra. Therefore Rashi explains that this refers to the ox as the olah-offering, as it says “a fire offering to Hashem.” This is to the exclusion of a sin-offering which is not “a fire-offering to Hashem” given that only an olah-offering is considered as such. @p1[27]@p2<TIE>Through idolatry.@bo The @ITvav@it of “@hh<HEB>ואם נפש@ee<ENG>” (@ITand@it if one person) links this to the previous matter which referred to idol worship. @d1But for this, a goat is designated.@bo Meaning that this is also a proof that the passage refers to erroneous idol worship. Because surely the offering for the erroneous transgression by an individual that is stated in Parshas Vayikra is a sheep or a goat, while in this passage it is specifically a goat.<QC>
@p1[30]@p2<TIE>In addition the Rabbis derive.@bo Meaning: Furthermore you should know that it is an expression of a curse, given that the Rabbis derive from here that someone who curses Hashem is subject to @ITkoreis@it when there are no witnesses or warning, when it is done intentionally. However, if it had not been an expression of a curse, then how could the Rabbis derive from here that one who curses Hashem is subject to @ITkoreis@it? Rather the verse is certainly to be explained in this way. @p1[31]@p2<TIE>By the word of the Omnipresent.@bo Meaning that the term “the word of Hashem” here refers only to idol worship which was the first of the Ten Commandments that Yisroel heard by the word of the Omnipotent. This was not the case for the other commandments which were only heard by the word of Moshe, even though they too were the word of Hashem. Though Rashi explains that “blasphemy” refers to one who curses Hashem and not to idolatry, the phrase “for he has denigrated the word of Hashem” refers to idolatry. Thus it is as if the Torah had said “he has blasphemed Hashem and [the soul of that person] shall be cut off .<TIE>.<TIE>. @ITAnd if@it he denigrates the word of Hashem and violates His commandment; the soul of that person shall certainly be cut off.” @d1During the time his sin is within him.@bo And it is as if the Torah had stated “when the sin is within him.” Rashi had to give this explanation because it is impossible to explain “the sin is within him” as referring to the @ITkoreis@it as in “he shall bear his sin” in Parshas Tzav (Vayikra 7:18), since the Torah here has already mentioned @ITkoreis@it explicitly. @p1[32]@p2<TIE>They kept only the first Shabbos.@bo Meaning that if not so, why does the Torah mention that they were in the desert? Rather it is to teach that immediately after they came to the desert this man desecrated Shabbos, but not beforehand. One may ask: In chapter @ITKol Kisvei@it (Shabbos 118b) it says “If Yisroel had observed the first Shabbos, no nation or tongue could overpower them.” The answer is that these Midrashim disagree with one another. One may ask: It states (Sanhedrin 56b) Rav Yehudah said in the name of Rav: “As I commanded you” (Devarim 5:12) — this refers to Shabbos and monetary laws which I commanded you at Marah. This means that this it not their first Shabbos, as Tosafos ask (Shabbos 87b). The answer is that Rashi avoids this question because in Parshas Beshalach he explains “There he gave them” (Shemos 15:25) — in Marah he gave them some laws to involve themselves with, Shabbos, the red heifer and monetary laws. This implies that he informed them of these laws and taught them that Hashem would in the future command them so. @ITRamban@it also gives this explanation in Parshas Beshalach. Thus they had not yet been commanded to abstain from forbidden work on Shabbos, only to learn about the positive mitzvah of Shabbos (@ITKitzur Mizrochi@it). In my opinion this is not a question at all, because there the Torah does not say that they did any forbidden work, rather they went out to gather but did not collect anything. Thus they did not physically sin at all. Rather they did not observe Shabbos in thought, which is not considered a desecration. Therefore the Gemara says “if [Yisroel] had observed<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” meaning that had they observed it in thought as in action, then no one could overpower them. However, here the Torah says that this man came and physically desecrated Shabbos. @p1[33]@p2<TIE>They warned him but he did not desist from gathering.@bo The Torah does not say “those who found @hh<HEB>שקשש@ee<ENG>” (that he @IThad@it gathered) rather “@hh<HEB>מקושש@ee<ENG>” (he @ITwas@it gathering) meaning that after they saw and found him he was still gathering. Why is it presented it in this manner? To teach that they warned him, but he still continued to gather. This is Rashi’s explanation in Sanhedrin 41a. @ITRe’m@it explains that if not so, why does the Torah need to say “those who found him gathering,” surely it is obvious that “they brought him near” refers to those who found him. Rather the Torah is saying that those who found him approached him, and he was still gathering, and did not desist. @p1[34]@p2<TIE>How to execute him.@bo The Torah writes “since it was not specified what was to be done to him” which implies that they knew he was liable to the death penalty, as it is written “One who desecrates it shall surely die” (Shemos 31:14), nonetheless it had not been specified by which death penalty. However regarding the person who cursed [Hashem] in Parshas Emor (Vayikra 24:12) it says “to explain for them” which implies that they did not know whether he was liable for death or not. You might ask: The standard death penalty in the Torah is strangulation, as Rashi explains in Parshas Emor. Why is this not the same [penalty] regarding Shabbos, where the Torah also mentions the death penalty without clarification, when it writes “one who desecrates it shall surely die”? The answer is that they were uncertain, given that one who desecrates Shabbos is compared to one who engages in idolatry, and idolatry is punishable by stoning. (@ITKitzur Mizrachi@it) One cannot pose a difficulty according to Rabbi Yehudah who says that one is not liable for a punishment until one is warned which form of death penalty will be imposed. For the case of the wood gatherer was different, given that it was a one-time ruling. @ITMaharan@it answers that they may have warned him by incorporating all four court imposed death penalties, thus allowing him to be killed using any of those forms. @p1[35]@p2<TIE>Similarly “constantly remember” and “constantly keep.”@bo Meaning that this is in the present tense, even though it was not to be done constantly, only at that time when he desecrated Shabbos. Since it refers to anyone who would ever gather, and thus desecrate Shabbos, the present tense is appropriate; for it would always be incumbent upon them to execute by stoning anyone who transgressed this prohibition. @p1[38]@p2<TIE>So named because of the threads.@bo According to the first interpretation there is a difficulty: The Torah should have stated “to make for themselves @hh<HEB>פתילים@ee<ENG> (threads)” given that the verse mentions “a @hh<HEB>פתיל@ee<ENG> (thread) of blue”. Therefore Rashi brings the other interpretation. However according to the other interpretation there is a difficulty: The Torah should have said @hh<HEB>מציצין@ee<ENG> (viewings) rather than @hh<HEB>ציצית@ee<ENG>, therefore he also brings the first interpretation where the verse states “He took me by the @hh<HEB>ציצית@ee<ENG> (fringes) of my head.” @d1Of the chilazon-fish.@bo This is a fish that comes out of the sea once every seventy years, and its appearance is similar to that of the sea. One would use it to color a thread of wool that is placed on the tzitzis. @p1[39]@p2<TIE>The numerical value of tzitzis is 600.@bo @ITRe’m@it writes: It appears to me that Rashi’s explanation is according to the opinion that one expounds a verse according to the way the words are read. Here one reads @hh<HEB>ציצית@ee<ENG> as if it was written in full with two @ITyuds@it (rather than @hh<HEB>ציצת@ee<ENG> as it is actually written). @d1And the eight threads .<TIE>.<TIE>. equal 613.@bo Not that the Torah’s intent was so, because there are opinions that one can use sixteen threads. Similarly regarding the knots, though under Torah law one only needs one knot, one can make more [than five]. Rather it was the intention of the Rabbinic enactment that there be five knots, no more and no less, in order to complete the sum [of 613] such that there would be a greater remembrance of the mitzvos when one looked at the tzitzis and the knots. Thus Rashi explains the verse according to the situation after the enactment rather that before so. @p1[41]@p2<TIE>Faithful in enacting punishment.@bo @hh<HEB>אלהים@ee<ENG> (God) has the same numerical value as @hh<HEB>זה דיין@ee<ENG> (He is a judge), teaching that this refers to His attribute of strict justice. @d1On condition that you accept my decrees.@bo But not “to be God” because either way He would be God. However the acceptance of His decrees, making Him “your God,” was part of the condition. Had He not redeemed them from the house of bondage they would have been like the other nations, having no obligation to accept the decrees. @d1Another interpretation.@bo Meaning that there is a difficulty with the first interpretation, given that the Torah also writes “to be your God” which implies that I will rule over you even against your will, therefore he brings another interpretation. However according to this other interpretation there is a difficulty that the Torah only needed to say “I am Hashem” given that regarding the plague of the firstborn it only wrote “Hashem struck<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Thus why was it necessary to add “your God”? Consequently the first interpretation was also necessary. @d1Indigo dye.@bo Rashi explains that this is a color similar to techeiles. However the Torah said “a thread of techeiles” and techeiles is colored with the blood of the chilazon-fish. This verse was necessary in order to teach that one transgresses from the moment that one ties the thread, as Tosafos write in Bava Metzia 61b. @d1But not on a garment with five [corners].@bo Meaning that one would have placed tzitzis on all five corners. Nonetheless, one is obliged to place tzitzis on four corners even if the garment has five, given that “one hundred is included in two hundred.” This point is agreed to by all. However @ITRe’m@it explains this as meaning that a garment of five corners is entirely exempt and that though Rashi brings the words of Rabbi Moshe Hadarshan, he himself does not agree. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) Initially Rashi uses the heading “on the corners” that was stated here and gives a reason why specifically said “on the corners.” Then he uses the heading “on the four corners” that was stated in Parshas Ki Seitzei (Devarim 22:12) and explains “but not on a garment with three<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @d1Correspond with the eight days that the Israelites waited from the time they left Egypt until they sang.@bo You might ask: In Parshas Beshalach (Shemos 14:5) Rashi explains that they sang on the seventh day of Pesach. The answer is that he holds that the night is considered part of the preceding day. This is similar to [the concept of ‘day’ regarding] offerings about which the Torah writes “On the day that you slaughter you shall eat, and that which remains until morning you shall burn in fire” (Vayikra 19:6). There, why would it only be necessary burn it in the morning? Surely once the Torah wrote “on the day that you slaughter you shall eat,” one would have already been obligated to burn it at night. Rather it is certain that one is also permitted to eat it at night, given that the night is considered part of the preceding day. The start of the exodus was calculated from immediately after they slaughtered, roasted and ate the Pesach offering, thus from the start of the exodus there were eight days. However from the actual exodus which was on the fifteenth of the month there were seven days, because if one does not include that night they sang on the seventh day. Rabbi Moshe Hadarshan is also of this opinion. This is in contrast to @ITRe’m@it who explains that these are the words of Rabbi Moshe Hadarshan but Rashi is not of this opinion. See @ITNachalas Yaakov@it who disproves the view of @ITRe’m@it and says that these are Rashi’s words and not those of Rabbi Moshe Hadarshan. For it is only the comment “why was the passage of the wood gatherer juxtaposed<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” which is to be attributed to Rabbi Moshe Hadarshan.<QC>
@p1[1]@p2<TIE>This passage is beautifully expounded by Midrash Rabbi Tanchuma.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Why does the Torah use the term “took”? However, given that Rashi says in Parshas Bereishis (3:8) the he comes only to explain the plain meaning of the Torah, not its Midrashic interpretation, he therefore says here that “this chapter is beautifully expounded.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Since the Midrashic explanation is close to the plain meaning, Rashi explains it according to the Midrashic interpretation and it is not necessary to explain it according to the plain meaning. @d1Disassociated from the community.@bo Meaning: This taking was in thought — in his heart — and his heart was the subject [of the taking] while Korach was the object. Consequently @hh<HEB>ויקח@ee<ENG> (he took) has the same meaning as @hh<HEB>ויוקח@ee<ENG> (he was taken) which concurs with the Targum who translates as @hh<HEB>ואתפלג@ee<ENG>. @d1Another interpretation “Korach took”: He won over the heads of the Sanhedrin.@bo Because according to the first interpretation there is a difficulty that @hh<HEB>ויקח@ee<ENG> (he took) was explained as @hh<HEB>ויוקח@ee<ENG> (he was taken). However, according to the other interpretation there is a difficulty since the verse does not specify whom he took as it does concerning Moshe, where it is written “Take Aharon.” Therefore Rashi also gives the first reason.<QC>
@d1Scripture does not mention “the son of Yaakov.”@bo Rashi wishes to explain why the Torah does not also trace his genealogy to Yaakov. He answers that “Yaakov implored<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @d1Where is his name mentioned.@bo Meaning: where is the name of Yaakov mentioned in connection with Korach such that one has to explain why his name is not mentioned here; for surely it is usual for genealogy to be traced back only to the tribe. @ITRe’m@it writes that there is still a difficulty according to the Midrash (Tanchuma 3) which expounds the verse (Bereishis 49:6) “Do not let my soul come into their plot” as referring to the incident of the spies. Similarly there is a difficulty according to Rashi’s explanation in Parshas Vayechi that “Do not let my soul come into their plot” refers to the incident with Zimri ben Salu, leader of paternal house of Shimon (Bamidbar 25:14). There Rashi did not ask where else the name “son of Yaakov” was mentioned concerning Zimri such that one would have to explain why it was not mentioned. @ITRe’m@it leaves the matter as requiring further investigation. See what I wrote in Parshas Vayechi that answers the question of @ITRe’m.@it @d1Neighboring Kehos and his sons.@bo Rashi wishes to answer how Dasan and Aviram came to be with the sons of Kehos to join Korach in disputing the @ITkehunah.@it Surely they were neither Levites nor firstborn, as it is written (Bamidbar 26:9) “Eliav’s sons were Nemueil, Dasan and Aviram.” And if they came to dispute the @ITkehunah@it on behalf of their brother Nemueil, who was a firstborn, it is incongruous that they would have come to do so when Nemueil the subject of the dispute is not mentioned in Scripture as having protested. @d1Woe to the wicked and woe to his neighbor.@bo (@ITMaharshal@it) I have a tradition from my father that this is the explanation: Initially Rashi said “Yaakov implored for compassion.<TIE>.<TIE>.” But this raises the difficulty that the genealogy of Dasan and Aviram was traced back to Reuven and the Torah also did not say “son of Yaakov.” Yet we do not find that Yaakov requested that the genealogy of Reuven’s sons not be traced to him regarding the dispute of Korach. Therefore Rashi explains “woe to the wicked.<TIE>.<TIE>.” and that consequently they were automatically included in his request. @d1Why did Korach see fit.@bo Meaning: Even though Korach suspected Moshe in all of his actions, that everything he did was on his own accord, nonetheless he should not have disputed the @ITkehunah.@it For surely Aharon was rightfully before him, being he is the firstborn of Amram. @ITRe’m.@it You might ask: Why does Rashi not explain this in its place, and also how is this question related to the preceding explanation? The answer is that before he explained about Dasan and Aviram it was understood that one could not ask “why did he see fit” given that he also wanted to be a kohein. However, now he explained that the involvement Dasan and Aviram was because the tribe of Reuven made their camp according to the arrangement of the banners. Consequently one understands that this dispute occurred in the second year after the exodus from Egypt given that the arrangement of the banners began in the second year, as is explained in Parshas Bamidbar. Therefore, Rashi asks why Korach saw fit to dispute with Moshe over the priesthood in the second year. Why did he not dispute with Moshe in the first year, immediately after the building of the Mishkon? Rashi answers that “he envied Elitzafan for his leadership.<TIE>.<TIE>.” for he was also appointed at the time when the banners were arranged. And once Korach had entered into the dispute, he wanted to nullify everything, even those things to which he had no rights. @d1Elitzafan for his leadership.@bo You might ask: Why did Rashi explain above that he came to cast aspersion regarding the @ITkehunah@it? The answer is that if Moshe had given Korach the leadership he certainly would not have disputed the @ITkehunah.@it However once he gave the leadership to Elitzafan, Korach came to dispute everything, even the @ITkehunah.@it Therefore Rashi explains “I will oppose him and nullify everything he said.” You might ask: Why did he also not dispute the monarchy (which was Moshe’s position). The answer is that since the sacrificial service was originally performed by the firstborn, they would join him in nullifying Moshe’s ruling in order that they could become the kohanim. But regarding the monarchy everyone agreed that Moshe should be king, because it was rightfully his, for he took them out of Egypt. Furthermore they could not all be kings, and therefore they would not have joined him in disputing the monarchy.<QC>
@d1Those called from the congregation.@bo There are those who ask: Why did Rashi bring a proof from there where the Torah writes, “Those called from the congregation”? Surely his source there was only because the Torah writes “@ITleaders@it of [their fathers’] tribes” and here also Scripture writes “@ITleaders@it of the congregation.” The answer is that if not for those words written there, one would have said they were not the heads of the Sanhedrin, since it is written (v. 2), “Those who were called to meetings.” From this, one would understand that they were not called to @ITevery@it matter dealing with sanctity, rather only at certain times. Therefore Rashi brings a proof from there that they were called each time to any matter of sanctity, for the Torah writes “those called from the congregation” meaning for any matter that the congregation required. Rashi adds “and the like” because the people who were designated by name were only the twelve leaders of the tribes, while here there were two hundred and fifty men. Thus he was forced to add “and the like” to say that they were all leaders of Bnei Yisroel, and among them were leaders of the tribes and heads of the Sanhedrin. The @ITgezeirah@it @ITshavah@it (scriptural comparison) teaches that they were of the stature of Elitzur and his companions. And the verse that states that they numbered two hundred and fifty teaches that one should not say that it was specifically the twelve who were designated by name [that were of the stature of Elitzur and his companions], but not the others [rather, they were all of the same stature]. @ITRe’m@it @d1Garments made completely of @BItecheiles.@bo At the end of Parshas Shelach the Torah mentions @ITtzitzis@it and juxtaposes this to “Korach took,” to teach that he took @ITtzitzis.@it You might ask: why does Rashi expound the juxtaposition here? Rashi only does so if the verse is not written in its correct place, as I explained in Parshas Shelach (13:2). The answer is that here too, according to my previous explanation (s.v. ‘Why did Korach see fit’) this section is not its correct place given that the dispute of Korach was over the leadership of Elitzafan. Elitzafan's appointment as leader occurred before the departure from the Mountain of Hashem. If so, why was this section placed here when it belongs in Parshas Bamidbar? In order for us to expound the juxtaposition. (@ITGur Aryeh@it) You might ask: What did Korach think? If he held that a garment of @ITtecheiles@it was exempt from @ITtzitzis,@it perhaps Moshe would also answer that it was exempt and there would be no grounds for dispute. And if Korach held that it needed @ITtzitzis,@it then this would only have been because there was reason to obligate it. So perhaps Moshe would also answer with this reasoning and there would be no grounds for dispute. The answer appears to be that Korach’s main focus was not the garment alone. Rather, he thought that Moshe would answer that a garment made completely of @ITtecheiles@it is exempt from tzitzis, and he would counter that the entire congregation are holy and therefore we do not need a Kohein Gadol. See there where he details the comparison of @ITtzitzis@it and the @ITkehunah.@it @d1Dasan and Aviram and On the son of Peles.@bo So that one does not explain “the @ITsons@it of Reuvein” as referring to Peles alone, and that he was [identical with] Palu son of Reuvein. We find this language elsewhere, as in “the @ITsons@it of Dan are Chushim” (Bereishis 46:23) and “the @ITsons@it of Palu are Eliav” (Bamidbar 26:8) where the Torah refers to them in the plural form even though there was only one son. Therefore Rashi explains that the sons of Reuvein were “Dasan and Aviram and On son of Peles,” meaning that Peles was also one of the descendants of Reuvein. We need not ask how one might have thought that Peles was [another name for] Palu when, if so, the Torah should have placed On before Dasan and Aviram, given that they were sons of Eliav son of Palu whereas On was the son of Palu himself! This is not a difficulty because the Torah merely places first those who were more vociferous in the dispute. You might ask: Perhaps he was really the son of Palu, and how does Rashi know that he was not? It appears that Rashi was careful to state “and On son of Peles” because the Torah should have just said “Dasan, Aviram and On.” Why does Scripture write “son of Peles”? This is Rashi’s inference. Furthermore, the Torah writes “On son of Peles” while it should have written “the sons of Eliav, and On, the sons of Peles, son of Reuvein” given that Eliav and On would have been brothers, both sons of Peles, if he had been Palu. Finally, it should not have said “the @ITsons@it of Reuvein” instead of “@ITson@it [of Reuvein]” and “@ITson@it [of Peles]” instead of “@ITsons@it [of Peles].” Rather “sons” must mean “from the family of Reuvein” and therefore Rashi adds “and On the son of Peles.” @ITR. Yaakov Triosh. Re’m@it writes: There are opinions that Rashi means to say that “the sons of Reuvein” refers back to “Dasan and Aviram” alone, and not to On, as if the Torah had said that Dasan and Aviram were from the sons of Reuvein, but that On was a son of Peles and not from the sons of Reuvein. There are also opinions that Rashi’s intention is just the opposite and that it also refers back to On, in order that one not say that “the sons of Reuven” refers to Dasan and Aviram but not to On. This might be so, given that neither On nor Peles are ever mentioned along with the sons of Reuvein. @ITRe’m@it rejects both of these opinions, and I have written what appears most correct to me.<QC>
@p1[3]@p2<TIE>You have taken much more.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo With this Rashi resolves many issues. He explains that the word @hh<HEB>רב@ee<ENG> is a noun as in @hh<HEB>הרבה@ee<ENG> ("much") and he adds “much more” because otherwise one might have said that the greatness that they took for themselves was fitting for them. He also adds the word @hh<HEB>לקחתם@ee<ENG> ("you have taken") because the word @hh<HEB>לכם@ee<ENG> ("for yourselves") alone would not make sense without being together with “you have taken.” Also, because the dispute was over them having taken more than was appropriate, not over what they already had, he writes here “you have @ITtaken@it .<TIE>.<TIE>. for yourselves” rather than “you @IThave.@it” Rashi also explains that the word @hh<HEB>לכם@ee<ENG> means “for yourselves” because without this one might think that they took it in order to divide among others. He also adds the word “distinction” because the word “much” can refer to ignominy as well as to distinction and exaltedness. Therefore Rashi adds the word “distinction.” @d1They all heard [the word] at Sinai.@bo @ITRe’m@it writes: I do not know why Rashi did not make this comment on the phrases, “You shall be holy” (Vayikra 19:12), “You shall sanctify yourselves and you shall be holy” (ibid. 11:44), and “For [you are] a holy nation” (Devarim 14:2). It appears to me that if not so, here one could have answered that even though the congregation was holy, Moshe and Aharon possessed a higher degree of holiness, for they were prophets and had heard the Word from the mouth of Hashem. Therefore, Rashi explains “they all heard<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”<QC>
@d1If you took .<TIE>.<TIE>. you should not have chosen.@bo (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) This means: If you took the monarchy you took it rightfully, because you heard all the commandments whereas the community heard only “I am Hashem” and “You shall not have.” But, nonetheless you should not have chosen the @ITkehunah@it for your brother, given that your brother did not hear any more than the rest of the community. This is what Korach means when he says, “Why do you raise @ITyourselves@it” referring to both Moshe @ITand@it Aharon, for it would have been enough for Moshe to have taken only the monarchy. However one should not explain that Korach intended to dispute Moshe’s taking the monarchy as well, because in the entire parshah we only find a dispute regarding only the @ITkehunah.@it @d1You were not alone in hearing.@bo (@ITGur Aryeh@it) If Hashem wished to teach you a new matter, He would have also said it to everyone, not you alone, [saying] that Aharon was to be the kohein and Elitzafan the leader. @p1[4]@p2<TIE>Because of the dispute.@bo You might ask: Surely above regarding the incident of the spies it is also written “Moshe and Aharon fell upon their faces” (Bamidbar 14:5)? The answer is that above one can answer that they fell upon their faces to pray. Since it is not written there that they said anything, one may say that they prayed. However here it is written “Moshe spoke to Korach,” which implies that while he fell upon his face he spoke to them, rather than pray. If so why did he fall upon his face? [It must be] “Because of the dispute.” @d1Their fourth despicable act.@bo You might ask: Surely this was only the third, given that the dispute of Korach was before the incident of the spies, as I explained above in Parshas Shelach (Bamidbar 13:2). The answer is that above in Parshas Shelach, Rashi was explaining according to his first interpretation in Parshas Devarim (1:1), where he says that Chatzeros was the location of Korach’s dispute. However here Rashi explains according to the alternative interpretation, in which he said that Chatzeros refers to [the incident of] Miriam [speaking against Moshe]. Therefore, it is possible that the incident of the spies was before the dispute of Korach, and therefore this was the fourth despicable act. @d1This is a time when we are intoxicated.@bo They were [not actually drunk, but were] engaged in this dispute all day, therefore he said “This is a time when we are intoxicated.” Similarly we find written (Yeshayohu 51:21), “Intoxicated but not from wine.” We learn from here that even if one has not drunk he can be called “intoxicated.” Rashi had a further question: Why did Moshe not settle his own mind? Therefore he answers that “his intention was.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @d1For the Levite services.@bo For the Torah writes about them (Bamidbar 8:14), “The Levites shall be Mine.” You might ask: Surely they were only disputing the service of the @ITkehunah@it? The answer is that Moshe said [to himself] as follows: If I tell them [that Hashem will make known the one who is] holy for the @ITkehunah,@it when they see that they have no way of disputing the @ITkehunah@it they will dispute the Levite service. This would have been fitting, given that they were firstborn and the Levites had replaced them. Therefore Rashi explains .<TIE>.<TIE>. @d1Them [close] to him.@bo This is the meaning of the verse: In the morning Hashem will make known “who is His” for the [Levite] service, as the Torah states “the Levites shall be Mine” (Bamidbar 8:14). Also, “who is holy” for the @ITkehunah,@it as it states “Aharon was separated and consecrated as the holy of holies” (Divrei Hayamim I 23:13). Accordingly the phrase “bring close to Him” has no subject, therefore Rashi adds the word “them.” How was this to be done? Let all the two hundred and fifty men who were seeking the @ITkehunah@it come close “and offer the incense before Him.” The word "before Him" (@hh<HEB>לפניו@ee<ENG>) has the same meaning as the word "to him" (@hh<HEB>אליו@ee<ENG>) in the phrase “bring close to Him.” Thus the word “to Him” has the sense of “before Him.” In this way, He will determine who is holy, and everyone will know that Aharon is holy for the @ITkehunah@it when his incense is accepted. [They will also know that] the Levites are fit for the Levite service when all those who offer the incense are burned up, among them being Korach who was a Levite and was still burned up. Thus the complaint of the Levites will be nullified. The Targum proves this point given that the first @hh<HEB>אליו@ee<ENG> ("to him") he translated as “before him” and the second as “into his service.” The second @hh<HEB>אליו@ee<ENG> ("to him") that appears in the verse must refer to the service of the @ITkehunah. Re’m@it<QC>
@p1[7]@p2<TIE>But Korach who was astute<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo Meaning: Since the Torah did not call him a “sinner with his soul,” he must certainly have had some reason that he was relying upon. @d1You have undertaken a great task for yourselves.@bo Rashi explains that @hh<HEB>רב@ee<ENG> (too much) here is an adjective, but that the object of adjective is missing. Conversely, he explains the first @hh<HEB>רב@ee<ENG> (v. 3) as meaning “much” which is a noun rather than an adjective. This was because there Korach was disputing the great positions that [Moshe and Aharon] had taken for themselves, and therefore Rashi explains it in the sense of “greatness.” But, here Moshe’s surprise was only over the enormity of their brazenness to dispute that what Hashem had instructed, therefore Rashi explains the word @hh<HEB>רב@ee<ENG> in the sense of an immense [undertaking]. Without the addition of the words “you have undertaken,” one would not have understood the meaning of the phrase “too much upon yourselves.” He says @hh<HEB>בעצמכם@ee<ENG> ("upon yourselves") rather than @hh<HEB>לעצמכם@ee<ENG> ("for yourselves") like above (v. 3) because the brazenness, which was the great task that they had undertaken, was part of themselves rather than something that had been taken from elsewhere. Therefore here Rashi explains @hh<HEB>בעצמכם@ee<ENG> ("upon yourselves"). Conversely, above it was something taken from elsewhere, because the prominence that they had taken was from elsewhere, thus Rashi explains the word @hh<HEB>לכם@ee<ENG> as meaning @hh<HEB>לעצמכם@ee<ENG> ("for yourselves"). (@ITGur Aryeh@it) One cannot explain this as “too much” like Rashi explains the words @hh<HEB>רב לכם@ee<ENG> above (v. 3), because it would be incongruous to refer to one who disputes with Hashem’s instructions as “too much” implying that it would be possible to have a minor dispute. However above, it can be explained as meaning “too much” since they accepted Moshe’s monarchy, but were disputing Aharon’s taking the @ITkehunah@it as being too much. @p1[10]@p2<TIE>To the service from which He distanced.@bo Not that He brought you near to Himself, given that he had already said “to bring you closer to Him” (v. 9). @p1[11]@p2<TIE>Because of this.@bo Meaning: The @ITlamed@it is not part of the root, unlike the @ITaleph@it in the word @hh<HEB>אכן@ee<ENG> (even so), which is a construct of the words @hh<HEB>אך@ee<ENG> (even) and @hh<HEB>כן@ee<ENG> (so). There the @ITkaf@it serves as the @ITkaf@it of the word @hh<HEB>אך@ee<ENG> and as the @ITkaf@it of the word @hh<HEB>כן@ee<ENG>. However here the @ITlamed@it of the word @hh<HEB>לכן@ee<ENG> serves the same purpose as the @ITlamed@it of @hh<HEB>אמרי לי אחי@ee<ENG> (say @ITbecause@it of me that he is my brother) (Bereishis 20:13) [which means] “because of me.” Here too @hh<HEB>לכן@ee<ENG> means “because of this.”<QC>
@p1[14]@p2<TIE>You told us “I will bring you up.”@bo Meaning: If Moshe had not promised to bring them up they would not have said this to him, for he would not have been obliged to do so. Rashi reverses the sequence of the verses to indicate that it would have been appropriate to say: “Is it but a pittance that you have brought us up from a land flowing with milk and honey, and into a land flowing with milk and honey you have not brought us, [rather] to kill us [in the desert], so to exercise your power.” Accordingly, the Torah would not have had to use the word @hh<HEB>אף@ee<ENG> ("even") and thus Rashi omits it. However, according to the sequence of the verses the word @hh<HEB>אף@ee<ENG> ("even") was necessary in order to explain “Is it not sufficient that you did us the evil of causing us to die in the desert, but @ITeven@it the good that you promised us you did not do.” This implies that “If you had [at least] done the good, then we would have also accepted the bad.” If one explains this way, there would be a difficulty: What was the point of their complaint over the lack of good? Since they were about to die, why would why care about the land flowing with milk and honey? Consequently, Rashi reverses the sequence of the verses. According to his explanation two matters are being addressed here, “not only [did you not fulfill the good].<TIE>.<TIE>.but you even decreed against us that we die.”<QC>
@d1Even if you send agents to put out.@bo Rashi is answering the question: It is obvious that if you were to put out their eyes, they would not be able to go up. @p1[15]@p2<TIE>The incense which they will offer.@bo Meaning: Even the smoke should not rise up before you. (@ITGur Aryeh@it) @ITRamban@it asks: Moshe was saying this regarding Dasan and Aviram, but they did not offer incense. The answer appears to be that although Dasan and Aviram did not bring any offerings, there is no difficulty, for we still could say that “the agent of a person is considered like [the sender] himself” (Kiddushin 41b). [Those who offered the incense could be considered agents of Dasan and Aviram] because the purpose of those who offered the incense was to say that they were fit to be Kohanim Gedolim, and a Kohen Gadol brings offerings on behalf of all the people, not for himself alone.<QC>
@d1That they have a portion in the continual communal sacrifices.@bo Rashi is answering the question: The verse refers to a @hh<HEB>מנחה@ee<ENG> (normally referring to a meal-offering), however incense is not called a @hh<HEB>מנחה@ee<ENG>. Therefore he explains it as being a reference to the continual sacrifices, since a meal-offering was also offered with the continual sacrifices. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) The continual sacrifices provide atonement; the morning continual offering for sins committed at night, and the afternoon continual offering for sins committed during the day. However [Moshe prayed that] they should not provide atonement for them. The Torah mentions their meal-offerings rather than the continual sacrifices because it is considered the principle offering. This is in accordance with the teaching of the Rabbis that one who reads Shema without donning tefillin is like one who offers a burnt-offering without a meal-offering. @ITR. Yona@it explains that one [who did not bring a meal-offering] also does not receive any reward for the burnt-offering, as the verse writes “[Aside from] the continual burnt-offering with its meal-offering” (Bamidbar 19:16). @d1One.@bo The word “one” does not describe the donkey, meaning “one of them [as] a donkey” to serve me. Accordingly “them” refers to Yisroel, meaning [according to this explanation] that Moshe is referring to Yisroel as donkeys. [Heaven] forbid that he would have spoken in such a way! Rather, “donkey” is juxtaposed to “one” meaning “the donkey @ITof@it one of them.” Rashi uses the word @hh<HEB>נטלתי@ee<ENG> ("I took") instead of @hh<HEB>נשאתי@ee<ENG> ("I sequestered") so that one not think that @hh<HEB>נשאתי@ee<ENG> is in the sense of “I raised up,” [which is an alternate meaning of the word]. @d1I could have justifiably taken [that donkey] from them.@bo "Since I needed a donkey, nonetheless I did not take it." For if not so, how is this to his credit! Perhaps it was because he had no need [for a donkey] that he did not take it, but had he needed to, he would have taken one.<QC>
@p1[16]@p2<TIE>Your congregation.@bo You might ask: Does the verse not write “You and your entire congregation”? The answer is that Korach thought Moshe would go with them; therefore Korach told him that he need not come with them because their quarrel was with Aharon, not him. Moshe then replied that “You and Aharon and they, tomorrow.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @ITRe’m@it explains that this was so that one does not think that the word “they” refers to other people, aside from the two hundred and fifty men mentioned above. This would be similar to Aharon who was also not one of those mentioned. Surely this is not so, because afterwards the Torah writes “Two hundred and fifty fire pans and you [and Aharon].<TIE>.<TIE>.” (v. 17), which refers to those mentioned above. @p1[19]@p2<TIE>With mockery.@bo For if not so, how could he have congregated all of Yisroel against them at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting? Surely only Korach, Dasan and Aviram and the two hundred fifty men were involved in the dispute. If the congregation were in the dispute from the beginning they would have also gathered against Moshe and Aharon. Rather, one must say that only on that night he enticed them with mockery. @d1He came in a pillar of cloud.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Was the Glory of Hashem not constantly over the Mishkon? @ITRe’m@it explains that this does not mean that He caused the Divine Presence to rest upon them, because surely He said “Separate yourselves from among this congregation.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (v. 21).<QC>
@p1[22]@p2<TIE>Knower of thoughts.@bo But not “the God of the souls” as would be understood from the word “spirits.” For what would its relevance be here, and what would be the reason for afterwards saying “if one man sins.” Rather, this means “Knower of thoughts” and thus You are able to know who the sinner is.<QC>
@d1Has sinned will You.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo Because the Torah does not refer to one who will sin in the future, rather to the dispute in which Korach had already sinned. However the word @hh<HEB>תקצוף@ee<ENG> (“shall you be angry”) is understood according to its plain meaning (in the future tense), because He had not yet become angry, rather He was about to do so. @d1The Holy One Blessed is He, said “You have spoken well.”@bo (@ITDivrei Dovid@it) This language implies that Hashem agreed with them. However, this would certainly pose a difficulty, since it is incongruous to say that Hashem would change His mind due to a person’s statement. It appears to me that [to answer this difficulty] one has to preface with the saying that “Anyone who profanes the Name of Heaven in secret will be made to pay for it in public, whether it was done unintentionally or intentionally” (Avot 4:4). This raises a difficulty: Why is the same punishment given for the unintentional and the intentional? Does this make sense? It seems to me that the answer is as follows: If one sins in secret and is punished [in public] by Hashem for this, it will lead to a profanation of Hashem’s Name. Others will not know about the sin and will say that this person was punished for nothing. Therefore, Hashem arranges for the person to sin in public so that people will say that Hashem’s justice is fair. Consequently, when we say that one who profanes the Name of Heaven in secret will be made to pay in public, means that it will be [Heavenly] arranged that he will profane Hashem’s Name a second time in public. Then after he does so a second time, whether unintentionally or intentionally [he will be made to pay in public]. In this vein, Rashi answers that in truth Yisroel were liable. Rashi explains that the phrase, “[Korach] congregated against them” (v. 19) teaches that he enticed them. Thus they were liable in thought, because one who disputes with his Rabbi is like one who disputes the Divine Presence and so they were liable for disputing against Hashem. In response Moshe and Aharon said “If one man sins” meaning that they sinned in secret and it was only known to Hashem. Thus, “shall you be angry with the entire congregation” causing a desecration of Hashem’s Name. Hashem replied “You have spoken well” because I know who sins in secret. This meant that Hashem would arrange a second sin for them, as indeed happened. The people later complained saying “you have killed the people of Hashem” (17:6) and in response Hashem said “I shall annihilate them” (17:10) because their sin had now been revealed. @p1[24]@p2<TIE>Depart.@bo Thus@hh<HEB>העלו @ee<ENG> ("ascend") is the same meaning as in “@hh<HEB>יצועי עלה@ee<ENG>" ("ascended my couch") (Bereishis 49:4). The @ITlamed@it of @hh<HEB>למשכן@ee<ENG> (lit. @ITto@it the dwelling) is superfluous. Consequently, Rashi writes@hh<HEB>סביבות@ee<ENG> ("the vicinity") instead of @hh<HEB>סביב@ee<ENG> ("around") to enable it to refer it to the word “dwelling,” given that the word @hh<HEB>סביב@ee<ENG> cannot be connected with what follows.<QC>
@d1With haughty bearing.@bo Rashi is answering the question: What is meant by “went out and stood”? It is obvious that they did not go out while sitting! (Re’m). There is another question: What is meant by “went out and stood”? The word “went out” implies that they were moving, while the word “stood” implies that they were still. Rashi answers this question by explaining “to revile and blaspheme.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @d1As He stood for forty days in connection to Golias.@bo And there it states, "I have blasphemed against Hashem, God of Yisrael." (source) @d1How inexorably destructive disputes are.@bo (@ITGur Aryeh@it) The Torah does not mention their punishment here, only their brazen wickedness in that they “went out and stood.” Nonetheless, one can learn from this that the minors were also punished, since the Torah recalls their sin. [Why was this necessary?] Surely a minor is not liable for punishment, given that he lacks sufficient intelligence. Rather one must say that Scripture comes to teach that they were all punished, both adults and minors, because the sin of dispute is not like other sins. You might ask: How is this sin different from other sins, such that even minors are punished? The answer is that dispute and @ITgehinnom@it were created at the same time, on the second day of Creation. This is in order to teach that dispute and @ITgehinnom@it are fundamentally linked, thus the punishment for dispute is inevitably @ITgehinnom. Gur Aryeh@it goes into detail to explain the reasoning for this. @p1[28]@p2<TIE>Conferring the @BIKehunah Gedolah@BO on Aharon and [appointing] his sons as assistants.@bo For if not so, why would he have said “all of these deeds”? Surely they were only disputing with Aharon. What is meant by “all of these deeds”? Therefore, although these matters were not mentioned previously, since they were well known, it is as if they had been mentioned [previously]. For if not [that they were included], the doubt over the assistantship and the leadership would have remained. The reason that the monarchy was not mentioned is that it was not being disputed. @p1[30]@p2<TIE>With a death that no one has experienced.@bo With this Rashi resolves a difficulty: Surely it is written (Koheles 1:9), “There is nothing new under the sun.” Therefore he explains, “To kill them with a death.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @d1If the mouth [of the earth] was created.@bo One may explain that the Rabbis were dealing with the apparent contradiction that: Surely ten things were created on Erev Shabbos at twilight and one of them was the mouth of the earth (Avos 5:6).<QC>
@p1[34]@p2<TIE>The sound of [the earth swallowing them up].@bo Meaning: The sound emitted from the splitting of the earth; this is similar to the sound of thunder which terrifies people causing them to flee. However it was not the sound of their screams when they were swallowed up, because this is not a sound that causes one to flee. On the contrary, it would cause people to gather in order to see the wonder. @p1[2]@p2<TIE>In the firepans.@bo But not the fire that was on the altar, because if so, what is meant by “for they were sanctified”? How does the fire that was upon the altar affect their sanctification? @d1From the firepans.@bo But not at a distance, because if so Scripture should have explained where [it was to be scattered]. @d1The firepans.@bo But not the fire, because if so, it should not have been thrown to the ground. Rashi afterwards explains why they were sanctified and thus prohibited from being used for personal benefit. It is because those who offered the incense had designated them as sacred service utensils and thus they had to be stored away. @p1[3]@p2<TIE>They became willful sinners with their souls.@bo Rashi is answering the following question: Surely Moshe warned them. If so, why did the Torah write @hh<HEB>חטאים@ee<ENG> (sinners) which has the connotation of unintentional sin? Therefore he explains that they were willful sinners, as it is written (v. 30) “That these men have angered.<TIE>.<TIE>.” which connotes rebellion, meaning that they willfully rebelled in disputing what Hashem had commanded. The reason why the Torah states @hh<HEB>חטאים@ee<ENG> (unintentional sinners) rather than@hh<HEB>פושעים@hh @ee<ENG> @ee(willful sinners) appears to be because most of them were from the tribe of Reuven, Korach’s neighbors, whom he incited. Similarly, the Rabbis say about them, “Woe to the wicked and woe to his neighbor.” This implies that initially it was not because of their own wickedness that they joined him, only because Korach was their neighbor. Therefore, they were considered as if they were unintentional sinners. @ITR. Yaakov Triosh.@it @d1The copper altar.@bo Not the golden altar, because the firepans were copper and one could not use copper on the golden altar. @ITRe’m.@it Furthermore, I have found [further proof that this is so] because it is written “and they shall be a sign for Bnei Yisroel” and a Yisroel is not permitted to enter the area of the golden altar. @p1[5]@p2<TIE>In order not to be.@bo Meaning: The Torah is giving a reason, not a warning [indicating a negative commandment]. When the Rabbis say “anyone who strengthens a dispute transgresses the negative prohibition that states ‘Do not be like Korach.<TIE>.<TIE>.’” it is only a Scriptural allusion to a Rabbinic law. @d1About Korach.@bo Even though the Torah often writes @hh<HEB>ביד משה@ee<ENG> (lit. ‘in the hand of Moshe’ but normally meaning ‘through Moshe’) as in Parshas Beha'aloscha where it writes “according to the word of Hashem in the hand of Moshe” (Bamidbar 9:23, 10:13) and similarly in Parshas Bechukosai (Vayikra 26:46) and Parshas Pinchos (Bamidbar 27:23). Nevertheless, Rashi is answering a question: What is the meaning of “in the hand of Moshe”? For one cannot answer that Hashem said through Moshe to Korach that he would be punished if he disputed the @ITkehunah,@it since we do not find this in the Torah. Furthermore why would He have commanded Korach any more than the rest of Yisroel? The phrase “to him” certainly refers to Korach, according to the Midrash which says, “This alludes that those who enter a dispute,” a reference to Korach who disputed. Rather one must say that “in the hand of Moshe” comes for one to expound an “allusion that those who dispute.<TIE>.<TIE>.” meaning that it is written “in the @IThand@it of Moshe” and there (Shemos 4:6) it is written “Please place your @IThand@it in your chest.” Just as there the Torah refers to @ITtzora’as,@it so too here, those who enter a dispute will be stricken with @ITtzora’as.@it @d1Are stricken with @BItzora’as.@bo Because the Midrash expounds the verse in this manner, we have proof that @hh<HEB>לו@ee<ENG> “to him” refers to Korach, the one who disputed the @ITkehunah.@it For one cannot explain that it refers to Aharon, given that @ITtzora’as@it has no bearing to him.<QC>
@p1[13]@p2<TIE>He grasped the angel.@bo For if not so, what is the meaning of “Between the living and the dead”? Were the living on one side and the dead on another such that Aharon could stand between them? But if it refers to the angel then it is understandable, and means that they no longer died. (@ITKitzur Mizrochi@it) Rashi explains this before his following comment “Another interpretation.<TIE>.<TIE>.” because it appears to contradict his previous comment (v. 11) “This was the secret [the Angel of Death] conveyed to him.” For if this were so, why was the plague not stopped immediately instead of him having to go to the Tent of Meeting? Therefore Rashi explains that Aharon immediately held the angel against his will with the incense; however the Angel of Death did not want to believe that Hashem now wished to use this remedy, given that the plague came because of the gravity of the sin. This secret would only apply when a plague comes naturally and the generation does not have the merit to overturn it, for only then does the incense help. Therefore, they had to go to the Tent of Meeting. After answering this difficulty, Rashi returned to explain the alternative interpretation. @d1An alternative interpretation: Why with incense.@bo Because according to the first reason there is a difficulty why did he not pray immediately so that the plague would not start, or at very least [why did he not pray] once it had started. Therefore, Rashi gives the alternative interpretation that it was a decree from Hashem. However, according to this alternative interpretation there is the difficulty that we do not find that Hashem said this to him. Therefore, Rashi also gives the first interpretation, “This was the secret<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”<QC>
@p1[21]@p2<TIE>In the middle.@bo Once the Torah writes “twelve staffs,” why is it necessary to say that “the staff of Aharon was among their staffs”? Rather this was to teach that before he placed them in the Mishkon, they arranged the staffs before them and Aharon’s staff was placed in the middle. @ITRe’m@it writes that Rashi may have found Midrashic support for his words, and it is not that the word “among” indicates this.<QC>
@p1[23]@p2<TIE>When the blossoms drop.@bo We find @hh<HEB>ציץ@ee<ENG> ("buds") mentioned before @hh<HEB>פרח@ee<ENG> ("blossom") as the verse states @hh<HEB>יציץ ופרח@ee<ENG> - "buds and blossom" (Yeshayahu 27:6) therefore Rashi explains “blossomed” as the plain interpretation. You might ask: Why does Rashi not explain @hh<HEB>ציץ@ee<ENG> ("bud") like its plain interpretation and explain that @hh<HEB>פרח@ee<ENG> is something that comes before the bud, for example the sap of the tree? The answer is that after mentioning @hh<HEB>ציץ@ee<ENG> ("buds"), the verse says “and bore ripe almonds,” and the budding of the fruit immediately precedes the ripening of the almonds. I have found a further explanation: Wherever there are two terms, such as here where the Torah states @hh<HEB>פרח@ee<ENG> ("blossom") and then states @hh<HEB>ויצץ ציץ@ee<ENG> ("and bloomed buds"), and the meaning of "blossom" is evident but the meaning of "buds" is not, then Rashi will explain “blossom” as its plain interpretation without the need for further explanation. However, since the meaning of @hh<HEB>ציץ@ee<ENG> ("buds") is not evident, he needs to explain “this refers to the budding of the fruit.” Similarly “their @ITminchah@it-offerings, their sin-offerings and their guilt-offerings” (Bamidbar 18:9) where Rashi explains “like the plain interpretation” because it is evident what they are. However, he then has to explain that “which they return to me” refers to the proselyte’s stolen property because I would not know its meaning. This is unlike “their @ITminchah@it-offerings, their sin-offerings and their guilt-offerings” the meaning of which is according to the plain interpretation, whether referring to the offerings of the congregation or to the offerings of an individual. Rashi in Parshas Vayeshev (Bereishis 40:10) writes that a @hh<HEB>פרח@ee<ENG> is the same as a @hh<HEB>נץ@ee<ENG> ("forming-fruit"), only that @hh<HEB>נץ@ee<ENG> is larger than the @hh<HEB>פרח@ee<ENG>. Accordingly, @hh<HEB>פרח@ee<ENG> would refer to a small forming-fruit while @hh<HEB>יוצא פרח@ee<ENG> ("a @hh<HEB>פרח@ee<ENG> came forth") here refers to a larger forming-fruit, given that both terms can be referred to as @hh<HEB>פרח@ee<ENG>. However, it is only when the blossom has not yet fallen that the @hh<HEB>נץ@ee<ENG> is also called a @hh<HEB>פרח@ee<ENG>. It refers to one which it is larger [than a normal @hh<HEB>פרח@ee<ENG>] which is termed a @hh<HEB>נץ קטן@ee<ENG> ("small forming-fruit"). But once the blossom falls, as here, the part remaining is called a @hh<HEB>ציץ@ee<ENG> ("[fruit]-bud"). @d1Why almonds.@bo (@ITGur Aryeh@it) Meaning: Once we have explained that “and bore ripe almonds” means “when the fruit was discernable.<TIE>.<TIE>.” why does the Torah say almonds and not a different species? It would have been understandable if the fruit was not discernable, merely standing in its blossom stage. Then one could have said that it was because this fruit blossoms most quickly, and even though it was a miracle, Hashem chose something that blossoms quickly, given that it produced the blossoms in one night. However if one says that the fruit was already discernable, there is a difficulty as to why this species in particular was chosen. For now there would be no difference between this fruit and another. Although this species blossoms quickly, it does not produce fruit that quickly. Since we must say that miraculously it produced fruit, it would have been possible to miraculously produce a different fruit. Rashi answers that this species was merely used as an allusion [that they will be punished quickly] given that it is the type of fruit which blossoms most quickly. @p1[25]@p2<TIE>As a remembrance that I chose Aharon.@bo The staff of Aharon sprouted for he was the one who gave over the staff, not his son Elozor who was the leader of the tribe of Levi. This was in contrast to the other leaders. With this they would know that Aharon was chosen, because the main dispute was over the @ITkehunah@it and not over the elevation of the tribe if Levi. Thus a symbol of remembrance was only needed for the @ITkehunah,@it and the blossoming of Aharon’s staff would be sufficient a symbol for the service of the Levites, given that there was only one staff for the tribe of Levi. This is a summation of the words of @ITRe’m.@it It appears to me that the blossoming of the staff of Aharon, who was from the tribe of Levi, was testimony that Hashem chose Levi over the other tribes. This was because the blossoming was on Aharon’s name, rather than on another place on the staff, as I wrote, providing testimony that Hashem had chosen Aharon over the rest of the Levites. @d1Feminine [verbl noun].@bo For if not so, it should have said@hh<HEB>ותכלינה @ee<ENG> ("[their complaints] will end" in the plural). Rashi did not explain@hh<HEB>ותכל @ee<ENG> as a reference to Moshe, meaning that Hashem said to him that with this action you will end their complaining against Me, because to end the complaining was not Moshe’s task, rather it would occur on its own as a result of this action. @d1The courtyard of the Tent of Meeting.@bo Meaning: The first@hh<HEB>הקרב@ee<ENG> ("anyone approaching") refers to the courtyard of the Tent of Meeting and the second @hh<HEB>הקרב@ee<ENG> refers to the inside of the Tent. And it is as if the verse had said, “Anyone who approaches the courtyard of the Tent of Meeting will die when he approaches the inside of the Tent of Meeting.” The verse did not say simply “anyone approaching the @ITMishkon@it of Hashem will die” because it would not be likely for one who is outside the courtyard to enter the Tent of Meeting. Thus there is no reason for them to be concerned about this and say “have we been consigned to die.” However those standing in the courtyard were close to entering the Tent of Meeting and they have reason to be concerned. @ITRe’m.@it @d1[Perhaps] we have been abandoned to die.@bo Not that they had already been consigned to death, because the @IThei@it prefix of @hh<HEB>האם@ee<ENG> (have.<TIE>.<TIE>.?) which denotes a question would not be appropriate. Furthermore, they did not actually die. Rather “perhaps.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1[1]@p2<TIE>To say to Aharon.@bo This is one of thirteen exclusions, as Rashi explains at the beginning of Parshas Vayikra (1:1), that [thirteen matters] were said to Moshe @ITand@it Aharon [and corresponding to them there are thirteen ‘exclusions,’ matters told [only] to Moshe for him to tell to Aharon]. @ITRe’m@it rejects this as follows: Perhaps these exclusions only come to exclude Aharon, teaching that Hashem said to Moshe that he should say to Aharon, when Moshe’s name is mentioned along with Aharon’s name. However when Moshe’s name is not mentioned, perhaps it was said to Aharon and not to Moshe. @ITRe’m@it quotes the Sifri. However it is [actually] from the section following (v. 8); see there in detail. It appears to me that Rashi’s proof is because above it is written “Bnei Yisroel said [the following] to Moshe, saying” (17:27). Rashi questions why it was necessary to write “saying.” Rather, it is certain that they said this to Moshe that he should ask Hashem about their difficulty. It is then logical that Moshe would have asked Hashem and that Hashem would have responded back to him. It would not be proper for Moshe to have asked Hashem, and for Hashem to respond to Aharon. Rather it is certain that He told Moshe to say to Aharon. This [explanation] appears to be correct to me, in contrast to the view of @ITRe’m.@it @d1The children of Kehos.@bo [Rashi knows that the verse is referring to the children of Kehos because] afterwards it is written “will bear the sin of the Sanctuary” and Rashi explains that this refers to “the sacred objects.<TIE>.<TIE>. the Tent, Ark, Table, and sacred vessels,” and these objects were carried by the sons of Kehos. Therefore Rashi explains that these were the children of Kehos. You might ask that perhaps “The sin of the Sanctuary” refers to the Sanctuary itself and He was warning that non-kohanim should not enter! The answer is that if so, why would Amram’s sons be different from the other Levites such that they are singled out and warned but the other Levites are not. @p1[2]@p2<TIE>In also warning.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo Not that they should be joined in the warning that you were told about — warning the Levites about the service of the @ITkehunah.@it Because the service of the @ITkehunah@it was not given over to them, so how could they warn the Levites about it? Rather, just as a kohein was commanded to warn the Levite not to come into contact with the service of the @ITkehunah,@it so too the Levite was commanded to warn the Israelite not to come into contact with the service of the Levites. Both would bear their sin if they did not warn them. @d1Administrators.@bo In the sense of @hh<HEB>אמר כל@ee<ENG> ("Sayer of everything"). In the book of Yirmeyah (52:24) Rashi comments that the keys of the courtyard were in the charge of the @hh<HEB>אמרכלין@ee<ENG>. You might ask: Perhaps [the words] “and serve you” refers to mundane service. The answer is that Rashi’s proof is from the end of the passage where it is written that they are “given to you as a gift — for Hashem.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (v. 6) indicating that it was specifically for holy service. @p1[4]@p2<TIE>I admonish you.@bo Meaning: I am warning you to warn the Israelites not to approach to the service of the @ITkehunah.@it Previously they were warned regarding the Levites, but now they were warned regarding the Israelites. Although this is a @ITkal vachomer@it (@ITa fortiori@it argument), that if they were warned regarding the Levites, all the more so this would apply to the Israelites, one cannot derive a punishment by using logical argument. @p1[5]@p2<TIE>As there already was.@bo It was necessary to say “as there already was” because of the word @hh<HEB>עוד@ee<ENG> ("more"), which implies that there had already been wrath regarding something similar. @p1[6]@p2<TIE>Perhaps .<TIE>.<TIE> .to attend.@bo Therefore, the mandate to be custodians was to your benefit, because if it were not for the Levites doing this you would be charged with performing these roles. @p1[7]@p2<TIE>As a gift.@bo Meaning: The service which is a gift. This means that the service itself was the gift, not that the service was a consequence of the gift, in which case the gift would have been something other than the service. Accordingly the verse afterwards would have explained that the service was as a gift because “I give you the @ITkehunah@it to you.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (According to this explanation "gift" would have referred to the @ITkehunah@it rather than to the service) @ITRe’m.@it @p1[8]@p2<TIE>This term denotes joy.@bo You might ask: It is written “Behold I am bringing a flood of water.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (Bereishis 6:17)! However, the question has already been answered in Sifri: The Omnipresent is joyful only when he removes those who anger him from the world. (@ITKitzur Mizrochi@it) One may ask: Previously it is written “Behold, I have brought your brothers” (v. 6) and Rashi did not make this comment. The answer is that @hh<HEB>הנה@ee<ENG> normally has the meaning of “now.” However, here it is impossible to explain that He gave them [the gifts] now, because He had already given them the twenty-four gifts of @ITkehunah.@it Therefore Rashi has to explain “with joy.<TIE>.<TIE>.” This is also implied by the parable that Rashi brings. @d1Presents him with twenty-four gifts [of @BIkehunah@BO].@bo In Maseches Chulin 133b it is taught: These [twenty-four are as follows]: Ten in the Sanctuary: (1)<TIE>The animal and (2)<TIE>the bird sin-offerings; (3)<TIE>The certain and (4)<TIE>the doubtful guilt-offerings; (5)<TIE>The peace-offering sacrifices of the congregation; (6)<TIE>The @ITlog@it of oil from the @ITmetzora@it; (7)<TIE>The two loaves; (8)<TIE>The show breads; (9)<TIE>The remainders of the meal-offerings and (10)<TIE>the remainders of the omer-offering. Four more in Yerushalayim: (11)<TIE>The firstborn; (12)<TIE>The first fruits; (13)<TIE>The portions set aside from the thanksgiving-offering and the ram of a nazarite, and (14)<TIE>The skins of the sacrifices. And ten outside Yerushalayim: (15)<TIE>@ITTerumah,@it (16)<TIE>@ITTerumas Ma'aser,@it (17)<TIE>@ITChallah@it; (18)<TIE>The first shearing; (19)<TIE>The gifts [from a non-consecrated animal]; (20)<TIE>The redemption of a firstborn son; (21)<TIE>The [redemption of] a firstborn donkey; (22)<TIE>A consecrated field; (23)<TIE>A consecrated ancestral field, and (24)<TIE>The proselyte’s stolen property. All of these gifts are mentioned in this Parshah and elsewhere. @d1Guard in ritual purity.@bo This is to say that they do not have to be guarded against non-kohanim, as in “you shall discharge@hh<HEB>משמרת הקודש @ee<ENG> [the sacred duties]” (v. 5). Because regarding @ITterumah@it it would only be appropriate to say that that one should not cause it to become ritually impure. @d1For greatness.@bo Because wine and grain are not used for anointing. @d1After the burning of the fire.@bo As if the verse had said “after the fire,” meaning after it has been burned in the fire. One cannot explain, “From the fire” as meaning from what was burned in the fire, because the kohanim do not take any portion from the sacrificial parts that are in the fire, since they have already been set aside for Hashem. Rather, its meaning is that the kohanim take their portion only after the burning of the sacrificial parts. @d1For example [the communal peace-offerings].@bo Given that it says here, “most holy” and the peace-offerings of an individual are of lesser holiness. However one should not explain this as meaning “all of their sacrifices” as implied, because “their @ITminchah@it-offerings, their sin-offerings and their guilt-offerings” is written afterwards. @d1This refers to the proselyte’s stolen property.@bo We learn a @ITgezeirah shavah@it [scriptural comparison]: There it is written “The debt being @ITreturned@it then belongs to Hashem, to the @ITkohein@it” (Bamidbar 5:8), and here it is written “which they @ITreturn@it to Me.” @p1[10]@p2<TIE>May be eaten only in the Sanctuary courtyard.@bo Thus the meaning of “in the supremely holy.<TIE>.<TIE>.” is “in the manner of the supremely holy.” This means that they are eaten in the manner of supremely holy [offerings], i.e., in a holy place, the courtyard, as is explained elsewhere. However, it does not refer to the Holy of Holies, the most inner part of the Sanctuary, because even the Kohein Gadol would enter there only on Yom Kippur, meaning that there is never any eating or drinking there. This ruling is repeated in order to teach that it is mandatory.<QC>
@p1[11]@p2<TIE>Which was set aside from the  thanksgiving-offering.@bo This refers to the breast, the thigh and one of the ten loaves that come with it. You might ask: What is Rashi’s source? Perhaps “@ITterumah@it-gift” here refers to the gifts from produce. Therefore Rashi comments that afterwards it is written “of all the wave-<FJ> offerings — since these require waving” such as the thanksgiving-offering, [the peace-offering] .<TIE>.<TIE>. @d1But not those ritually defiled.@bo Meaning: This is not a positive commandment to the ritually pure, rather a warning to the ritually defiled, for from the positive one can infer the negative. @d1Another interpretation of “all those ritually impure.”@bo According to the first interpretation there is a difficulty that the verse should have said @hh<HEB>כל אשר טהור@ee<ENG> ("All @ITwho are@it ritually pure") which would have implied “but not those who are ritually impure.” Therefore, Rashi gives the other interpretation. However according to the other interpretation there is a difficulty as to why do the words “All those ritually pure” allude to his wife, therefore he also needs the first interpretation.<QC>
@p1[18]@p2<TIE>The firstborn also<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo Meaning: The Torah compares the firstborn to the breast and the thigh of a peace-offering, they are also of lesser holiness and are eaten for two days and one night. @d1R’ Akiva came.@bo @ITRe’m@it writes: One may wonder why one needs the comparison? Let us learn it from the verse, “Year by year” (Devarim 15:20). There Rashi explains, “If one slaughtered it at the end of its first year then one could eat it on that day and for one day into the next year; this teaches that the firstborn is eaten for two days and one night.” It appears to me that if not for the words “it shall be yours” one would have thought that “year by year” meant the opposite, that if one slaughtered it at the end of the year it would only be eaten on that day and not in the next year. Therefore, the Torah writes, “It shall be yours” to add an additional “Be.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Inevitably we then expound that “year by year” means that “If [one slaughtered] it at the end of its first year.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1[20]@p2<TIE>Even the spoils.@bo Rashi wishes to answer the question: The verse writes, “You will have no inheritance in their land” so why is it also written, “And you will have not have a share.<TIE>.<TIE>.”? Rather it must refer even to the spoils! You might ask: Elozor the kohein took from the spoils, as is clear from Parshas Matos (Bamidbar 31:29). The answer is that here it is in reference to Eretz Yisroel and it was there that they did not take from the spoils. This is why it is written here “in their land” which implies that it is in reference to Eretz Yisroel.<QC>
@p1[23]@p2<TIE>The Levites.@bo Not that the word “they” and the words “their guilt” refer to Yisroel. Rather [the word] “them” refers to the Levites and “their guilt” refers to Yisroel who are mentioned afterwards. Rashi then explains what is meant by the “bearing of guilt,” that if they do not warn them [the Levites will bear the sins.<TIE>.<TIE>.] @p1[24]@p2<TIE>Scripture calls it “a @BIterumah@BO-gift” until he separates.@bo For if not so, why would the verse have to say “@ITterumah@it-gift (@hh<HEB>תרומה@ee<ENG>)” surely it had already said, “Which they must set aside (@hh<HEB>ירימו@ee<ENG>) to Hashem,” implying that one must set aside a portion from it. Furthermore, at the beginning the verse calls it a “tithe” while at the end it is called “@ITterumah.@it” @p1[27]@p2<TIE>Like the major @BIterumah@BO-gift which is called the first portion.@bo (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) I do not know why Rashi ended by saying that the major @ITterumah@it-gift is called the first portion? The answer is that it was because he wrote that the @ITterumah@it of your tithe is prohibited to unauthorized persons and to the ritually unclean like the major @ITterumah@it-gift to which it is compared. However, we have not yet learned that the major @ITterumah@it-gift itself is prohibited to unauthorized persons and the ritually impure. Therefore, Rashi ends saying this, a reference to the beginning of this section (v. 12) where the Torah writes@ee, “T@eehe best of the oil, and the best of the wine and grain, @hh<HEB>ראשיתם@ee<ENG> [their first portion].” There Rashi explains that “their first portion” refers to the major @ITterumah@it-gift. The passage there concludes (v. 13) that “all those ritually pure.<TIE>.<TIE>. [may eat it]” which excludes the ritually impure, while “in your house” (ibid.) excludes unauthorized persons. Here the Torah writes, “The same as grain from the granary and fully ripened fruit from the cistern” which refers to the grain wine and oil that was mentioned above. Consequently Rashi ends by saying that it is called “the first portion.” @p1[29]@p2<TIE>The major @BIterumah@BO<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo Since “from all of your tithes” (v. 28) implies the @ITterumah@it of the tithe, then “you must set aside all of the @ITterumah@it-gifts of Hashem” must refer to the major @ITterumah.@it But how could this be, for surely an Israelite would have already given the major @ITterumah@it-gift? Therefore Rashi explains that this is a case where the Levite pre-empted the kohein. This means after threshing, not while the grain was in on the stalks, because if the Levite pre-empted him at that stage he would only be obliged to give the kohein the @ITterumah@it of the tithe. @p1[30]@p2<TIE>After you set aside.@bo Meaning: This refers to what remains after the setting aside of the finest part and it does not mean “at the time when you set apart.” Thus the letter @ITbeis@it of @hh<HEB>בהרימכם@ee<ENG> ("when you set aside") is in the sense of “on account of” meaning afterwards. @d1What remains.@bo The letter @ITvav@it of @hh<HEB>ונחשב@ee<ENG> ("@ITand@it it will be considered") comes to add something, meaning that after you have set aside the finest portion @ITthen@it what remains will be considered.<TIE>.<TIE>. @d1So that you should not say.@bo Meaning: Rashi himself is explaining this so that one does not ask how one would assume that what remains was forbidden such that a verse was necessary in order to permit it. Rather it was “so that you should not say.<TIE>.<TIE>.”<QC>
@p1[32]@p2<TIE>Hence if [you do not].@bo Meaning: This verse does not come to exempt those who separate it. Because why would one assume that they were liable? Rather it comes to make one liable, and from the negative one infers the positive. Accordingly, one inevitably understands that “and you will not die” means “hence if you profane, you @ITwill@it die” because from the negative one infers the positive. For if not so, why would it say “and you will not die”? Why would one assume that one was liable so that a verse is needed to exempt him? @ITRe’m.@it<QC>
@p1[2]@p2<TIE>Because Satan. @boRashi is answering the question: Why are both the words “statute” and “Torah” written [for surely one of them would suffice]? Rashi is not asking why either term is used altogether, for in many instances it is written in the Torah [only] “statute,” for example, “This is the statute of the Pesach offering” (Shemos 12:43) and “If you follow my statutes” (Vayikra 26:3). Also “Torah” appears in, “This is the Torah for the burnt-offering, the meal offering, the sin-offering” (Ibid., 7:37) and, “This is the Torah for the sin-offering” (Vayikra 6:2). But here it is written, “This is the statute of the Torah” so why are both [terms] necessary? Furthermore, “statute” is juxtaposed to “Torah” implying that one term defines the other. It is as if Scripture said that the Torah of the [red] cow is a statute. And it is not similar to, “My statutes and My Torah” (Bereishis 26:5) for there “statutes” is an independent term, not modifying [the word] “Torah.” Now, even though the entire Torah is the King’s edict [and we cannot know the reasons for the mitzvot], nonetheless here it serves to notify that there is no reason at all [for this commandment], rather it is an [absolute] edict and it is worthy of acceptance by Yisroel without any known reason for it. This is what Rashi explains [when he says], “Because Satan, etc.” You might [challenge this and] note that in the episode dealing with Midyan’s utensils it is [also] written, “This is the statute of the Torah” (Bamidbar 31:21). The answer is that there too it is referring to the ashes of the [red] cow for it is written, “However, it must be purified with sprinkling water” (Ibid. v. 23). According to the Midrash (see Rashi there) that the verse, “However, it must be purified with sprinkling water” refers to immersion, for the Torah requires the immersion of metal utensils to purify them from the forbidden [foods absorbed within], one must say that the [act of] immersion itself is among those [statutes] that have no reason. [For one may wonder] why one thousand @ITseah@it of non-mikvah water cannot accomplish [i.e., purify] what forty @ITseah@it of mikvah water accomplishes. @ITRe”m@it @d1“What is this commandment? What is the reason for it?”@bo You might ask: Why does Rashi seemingly repeat [the same idea] “What is this commandment? What is the reason for it?” Also, why do the nations taunt Israel regarding this commandment more than with other commandments? There are many commandments that seemingly have no reason, such as [the prohibition of] mixing different seeds, or other such similar commandments. And furthermore, why do Satan and the nations of the world taunt Israel particularly regarding this commandment? It seems to me that there are three categories or commandments. First, there are commandments dealing with proper behavior such as prohibitions against theft, murder, and the like, [necessary] for the preservation of the world. Then there is a [second] category of commandments whose purpose is to remove and annul evil spirits and accusations. [These commandments] are the [blasting of the] shofar and [eating] matzos. And being that these commandments have a reason, the nations of the world do not taunt Israel regarding them because the commandments have a reason, in that they serve to remember a miracle. But Satan, which is the evil spirit, seeks to nullify the [reason by saying] "Why can the commandment only be fulfilled by blowing a shofar [i.e., ram’s horn] or only by eating matza and burning the chometz, etc.?" And a third category is commandments whose reason is not revealed, yet the nations of the world do not taunt Israel, such as lulav, @ITtzitzis@it, or forbidden food. However, this commandment is not related to any miracle, and it has the [power of] removing of impurity. And also it has similarities to witchcraft in its preparation and burning. Therefore Satan, along with the nations of the world, taunts [Israel] by saying, “What is this commandment which is similar to witchcraft? And also, what reason is there for this Commandment? For it is self-contradictory: The ashes of the [red] cow purify the impure, yet it causes the one who carries the ashes to become impure! And furthermore what reason is there for it to purify the impure?” R. Yaakov Taryesh @d1It will always be called.@bo Rashi is answering why Scripture writes @hh<HEB>ךילא@ee<ENG>? For @hh<HEB>ךילא@ee<ENG> ("to you") implies that Moshe is to be involved with the [red] cow, and below it is written, “Give it to Elozor [the kohein]” (v. 3). However, when it is written, “To take to you pure olive oil” (Vayikra 24:2), and Scripture does not clarify who should be involved with it, one might say that Moshe was to be involved, and therefore it is written, “To take to @ITyou@it pure olive oil.” @d1The cow which Moshe prepared in the wilderness.@bo Because when Moshe prepared this [red] cow in the wilderness, they left over some [ashes] for [future] @ITKohanim Gedolim@it for the Mount of Olives and for other cows that will be sanctified from these ashes, as Rashi explains below (v. 9). That is to say that all [future] cows would need to mix in [ashes] from Moshe’s cow and that is how they became sanctified. Otherwise, it would be disqualified as being ashes of the [red] cow. That is why they are all referred to as Moshe’s. @d1It must be perfectly red.@bo Meaning, why is it written “perfect”? For you cannot say that it means without a blemish for it is specifically stated, “Without a blemish.” @d1Two black hairs, it was disqualified.@bo You might ask: Perhaps even one hair [would disqualify it]? The answer is that had Scripture not written “perfect” but only “red,” I would know that it has to be entirely red, and that even if it had only one black hair it would be disqualified. Now that Scripture writes “perfect” it is to teach that it must be completely red, implying that were it to have even only one black hair it is disqualified. Thus we have a situation of an exclusion following an exclusion, and in such a situation we derive an inclusion, that one black hair does not disqualify, but two back hairs disqualify. However, @ITRe”m@it explains that [the law that] two hairs [disqualify] is a law [given] to Moshe at Sinai. @p1[3]@p2<TIE>The @BImitzvah@BO was performed by the assistant [@BIKohein Gadol@BO]. @boRashi is answering the question: Why does Scripture not write “Give it to the kohein”? Therefore it must be that the commandment is that it must be done by the assistant, meaning the assistant to the Kohein Gadol, i.e., Elozor. He is referred to as “assistant” because if the Kohein Gadol became defiled, this kohein would take his place and do the service. And when Rashi explains “The commandment was performed by the assistant,” that is to say, only pertaining to this cow it is a requirement for the assistant perform it, but regarding other cows there are those of the opinion that only the Kohein Gadol may perform this service (Masches Yoma 42b) as Rashi shortly explains (v. 9). Therefore it is written, “Give@IT it@it” meaning to say, “it” you give to Elozor, the assistant, but as for the others, they are to be prepared by Kohanim Gedolim. @d1Outside the three camps.@bo We learn from the term “outside the camp” that is written here and compare it to the term “outside the camp” (Vayikra 13:46) that is written in the section dealing with @ITmetzora@it. There, perforce, it is outside the three camps, for it is written, “He shall dwell alone, [his dwelling] shall be beyond the encampment,” (Ibid.), meaning he dwells alone, that no other defiled person dwells with him. See there and in Parshas Vayikra. @d1The commoner slaughters, etc.@bo [The proof is] for it is written, “In his presence.” Scripture should have written, “And someone shall slaughter it,” why add the term, “In his presence”? Perforce someone else slaughters, and since Scripture does not specify who the slaughterer is, it implies that even a commoner may slaughter. @p1[4]@p2<TIE>He stands east of Jerusalem, etc.@bo Rashi wants to answer [the following question]: Scripture writes that he must slaughter the cow outside the three camps, as previously explained (v. 3), and this verse that “Elozor [the kohein shall take] which implies that he sprinkles outside the three camps, so how can it be “directly facing the Tent of Meeting”? Rashi answers that it is not meant to be interpreted literally, that he was standing in front of the Tent of Meeting but rather he stood at a distance.<QC>
@p1[7]@p2<TIE>Except for the @BIzav.@bo Even one who has become defiled by a corpse is permitted into the camp of the Levites, and this is derived by an @ITa fortiori@it [proof] from the fact that a corpse is permitted into the camp of the Levites. For Yoseif’s bones were with Moshe, and Moshe resided in the camp of the Levites because he was a Levy, so certainly one whose impurity resulted from the [red] cow is allowed into the camp of the Levites. If so, that which is written afterward, “And afterwards he may come into the camp” refers to the camp of the @ITShechinah@it. @d1Rearrange.@bo [Rashi is answering the following] difficulty: The verse implies that after he washes his garments he may enter the camp of the @ITShichinah@it, but [this cannot be, for] he is still in a state of impurity until the evening. Is it possible for one to be permitted to enter the camp of the @ITShichinah @itwhen he is still in a state of impurity? He is not even allowed to eat @ITterumah@it until nightfall! So certainly he is not permitted to enter the camp of the @ITShechinah@it until nightfall. Therefore the verse must be rearranged, etc. @p1[9]@p2<TIE>[He divided it] into three parts.@bo As we learned in the third chapter of Parah (Mishnah 11), and Tosafos explains “three parts” as does Rashi. @ITRe”m@it writes: It seems to me that the division into three parts was by tradition. For although the verse first states "A ritually pure man shall gather, etc." (v. 9), it repeats and says "It shall remain [a keepsake]" for the community of @ITBnei Yisroel@it (ibid.) to let us know what shall be done with it by putting it down in a clean place. The third verse that states, "It shall be for @ITBnei Yisroel@it and for the proselyte who lives among them," etc. (v. 10) is to let us know that this law shall always be carried out according to this order. @d1The word denotes cleansing.@bo It does not have the usual meaning “sin-offering” because for what [sin] was it an atonement! @d1In its halachic sense, etc., and thus prohibited from personal benefit.@bo You might ask: But were they not purifying with it? The answer is that anything which was in the @hh<HEB>חיל@ee<ENG> [an area in the Beis Hamikdosh] was prohibited from personal benefit. Others explain that it is similar to the atonement brought about by the sin-offering which is also not considered a personal benefit.<QC>
@p1[12]@p2<TIE>With the ashes of the cow.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Scripture should have stated "with it" in the feminine form, given that it refers to the cow. Therefore, he explains “with the ashes” meaning that [@hh<HEB>בו@ee<ENG>] refers to the @hh<HEB>אפר@ee<ENG> (ashes) which is a masculine noun. @p1[13]@p2<TIE>This excludes that of an animal.@bo Meaning that once it is written “a corpse” it is obvious that it is “a soul”! Rashi answers that this is an explanation of the word “corpse,” meaning that the verse says “whoever touches a corpse” and [then explains] which type – “the corpse of a human soul.<TIE>.<TIE>.” [One might ask:] Above it is also written, “The corpse of any human soul” (v. 11)! The answer is that above it is written @hh<HEB>במת לכל נפש@ee<ENG> (lit. "The corpse @ITto@it any [human] soul") and this is the equivalent of writing @hh<HEB>במת של כל נפש האדם@ee<ENG> ("The corpse @ITof@it any human soul"). There the meaning of the @ITlamed@it is like the @ITlamed@it in Parshas Vayishlach (Bereishis 32:18-19): @hh<HEB>למי אתה@ee<ENG> (lit. "@ITTo@it whom are you?") meaning, “@ITOf@it whom are you?” Also like the @ITlamed@it in [the verse following] @hh<HEB>לעבדך ליעקב@ee<ENG> (lit. @IT"To@it your servant, @ITto@it Yaakov") meaning “@ITOf@it your servant, @ITof@it Yaakov.” But here the word @hh<HEB>מת@ee<ENG> ("corpse") and the word @hh<HEB>נפש@ee<ENG> ("soul") are both prefixed by a @ITbeis,@it thus it appears that the phrase “whoever touches” refers to both, [implying that they are independent of each other], as in the manner of a verb in a construct with a subsequent @ITbeis@it. Therefore, Rashi says that even so, the phrase “whoever touches” refers only to the word @hh<HEB>מת@ee<ENG> (corpse) and consequently he comments that “soul” is an explanation of the word “corpse.” @d1Refers to a quarter of blood.@bo Which emanates from a corpse. [This teaches] that one who touched the blood would be rendered impure for seven days, requiring sprinkling on the third and seventh days. Accordingly, the meaning of the @ITbeis@it would imply [that the phrase “whoever touches” refers to the words “corpse” and “soul” independently]. This is why Rashi brings the second interpretation. However, according to the second interpretation there is a difficulty that the verse should have stated “@ITor@it a soul.<TIE>.<TIE>.” given that “soul” is not an explanation of the word “corpse.” Therefore, Rashi also brings the first interpretation. @d1If he enters the [Mishkon] courtyard.@bo The verse implies that when he is impure he defiles the Mishkon of Hashem, but why would the Mishkon be defiled just because he was impure. Rashi answers that it refers to a case where he was impure and then entered the courtyard before having been sprinkled upon. You might ask: Rashi should have explained, “If he enters the Mishkon.<TIE>.<TIE>.” [and not, “If he enters the courtyard.]” The answer is that if so, this would have implied that it was specifically now when he was impure that he was forbidden to enter, but that when he was pure it would be permitted. But surely a non-kohein is forbidden to approach the Mishkon, even when he is pure. Regarding Rashi’s explanation that this is even after ritual immersion, we need not ask that perhaps it is specifically only when he does not immerse that there is a prohibition for him to enter the courtyard. For Rashi himself explains the term, “His impurity remains,” by saying that it implies that he had somewhat purified himself, however part of his impurity still remained. This was because he did not have the sprinklings on the third and seventh days. If so, this implies that even if he had already immersed he would be forbidden from entering. Alternatively, it is written, “Because the sprinkling water was not sprinkled on him.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Learn from there that it refers to one who had immersed, because if he had not immersed the verse should have said, “He did not immerse in water and [the sprinkling water] was not sprinkled on him.” Rather, one must say that it even refers to a case where he did immerse. @p1[14]@p2<TIE>While the corpse is inside.@bo Rashi negates the following: Do not say the tent would always render one impure, even after the corpse was removed. Logically [this is not so] since there is nothing there to render one impure, for surely one is not touching or carrying any impure object. It is understandable when the corpse is in the tent, then we regard it as if the tent is filled with impurity. For since the impurity cannot be contained it spreads out and rise up, permeating the tent. However, it is [only] when it is not contained, that impurity permeates the tent, making one who enters the tent as if he had touched the impurity itself. @p1[15]@p2<TIE>An earthen utensil .<TIE>.<TIE>. but from its inside.@bo For we find in Parshas Shemini (Vayikra 11:33) that an earthen utensil does not render articles impure from its outside, only by means of its airspace. “Thus [if its seal].<TIE>.<TIE>.” @d1The word denotes attachment.@bo You might ask: Previously in Parshas Vayetzei (Bereishis 30:8) regarding @hh<HEB>נפתולי אלהים נפתלתי@ee<ENG> ["I have been joined in Godly bonds"] Rashi comments: “Menachem ben Saruk explains this in his work in the sense of @hh<HEB>צמיד פתיל@ee<ENG> ["a cover fastened"] meaning, “I have become attached with attachments from the Omnipresent.<TIE>.<TIE>.” However I explain it in the sense of “stubborn and twisted” (Devarim 32:5).<TIE>.<TIE>.” It would therefore be difficult to say that here Rashi explains [@hh<HEB>פתיל@ee<ENG>] like Menachem ben Saruk, given that he disagrees with him. The explanation is that above when Rashi says “I explain it in the sense of ‘stubborn and twisted’.<TIE>.<TIE>.” he is referring to the words @hh<HEB>נפתולי אלהים@ee<ENG>; however the last word @hh<HEB>נפתלתי@ee<ENG> @ITis@it in the sense of @hh<HEB>צמיד פתיל@ee<ENG> ["a fastened cover"]. Therefore, here he also explains @hh<HEB>נפתלתי@ee<ENG> as meaning “I have been joined to my sister.” Nonetheless this appears to be a forced explanation, given that this is not the plain understanding of Rashi. The matter requires further investigation; see @ITGur Aryeh@it who comments at length. @p1[16]@p2<TIE>The @BIgollel@bo@it@BO and @BIdofek.@bo Which are normally found in the open field. A @ITgollel@it is the board that is placed over a casket as a cover, while those that form the walls are called @ITdofek@it (Rashi to Sanhedrin Perek Nigmar Hadin 47b). There are those who explain (Tosafos there) that the @ITgollel@it is the headstone, as it is written @hh<HEB>וגללו את האבן@ee<ENG> ["and roll the stone"] (Bereishis 29:3). And @ITdofek@it is [understood] like the first explanation.<QC>
@p1[19]@p2<TIE>This completes the purification.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Is it specifically on the seventh day that he purifies him, but after the seventh day he would not be able to purify him? On the contrary there is a @ITkal vachomer@it [@ITa fortiori@it argument] that he may do so. Rashi explains the verse only comes to teach that the completion of the purification is on the seventh day, to exclude less than seven days. It is as if it stated, “On the day his purification is completed.” @p1[20]@p2<TIE>Why was Mishkon stated@bo? Meaning: If the Torah said that one is forbidden to enter the Mikdash while impure, [we would derive using a] @ITkal vachomer@it [@ITa fortiori @itderivation] that [it is also forbidden to enter] the Mishkon (v. 13) which was anointed with the anointing oil [while impure]. The answer is that if it had said "Mishkon" but not "Mikdash", I would have said that one was liable for the Mishkon because it was anointed with the anointing oil, which is not the case for the Mikdash which was not anointed with the anointing oil [and] therefore he is not liable. Conversely, if it had said "Mikdash" I would have said that this law applies [only] for the Mikdash whose sanctity is eternal, which is not the case for the Mishkon whose sanctity was only temporary. Thus the verse informs us [that this is not so]. @p1[21]@p2<TIE>That the sprinkler is actually pure.@bo Since it is written “the pure person shall sprinkle on the unclean person” (v. 19), but it is obvious that he was pure, for if he was impure then he would make the water impure [through contact with it]. Rather it was to teach that even though he sprinkled, he remains pure. @d1That one who carries the purifying water becomes [extremely] impure .<TIE>.<TIE>. unlike one who touches.@bo Meaning: One should not question the explanation that “One who sprinkles.<TIE>.<TIE>.” comes to teach that one who carries it becomes impure if he carries an amount sufficient for sprinkling. [For one might say:] Surely afterwards it is written that “One who touches the sprinkling water shall remain impure until the evening,” which also implies that if there is an amount sufficient for sprinkling that he becomes impure. But if “One who sprinkles” refers to one who carries, why does Scripture write “and one who touches.” If one who carries becomes impure, then surely the one who touches [would also become impure]. Rashi explains that the verse, “One who sprinkles.<TIE>.<TIE>.” comes to teach that one who carried the purifying water has to immerse his clothes, which is not the case for one who merely touches it. There he does not need to immerse his clothes. Though Rashi says “To contaminate the garments he wears,” this is also the case for any clothing or utensils that an impure person touches when he is in contact with the source of impurity. The reason why Rashi refers to garments @ITthat he wears@it [because the garments referred to here] would ordinarily be worn at the time of his contact with the impurity. When Rashi writes that he becomes extremely impure, this refers to one who does not carry the water in order to sprinkle it and before the commandment [of sprinkling] was performed. However, if it was carried in order to sprinkle or after the commandment [of sprinkling] had been performed, one who touched or carried the water would be pure. @ITRe’m@it. @d1But his garments do not require ritual washing.@bo Meaning that because “one who sprinkles” refers to the one who carried the water, it should have said “one who touches” along with “one who sprinkles” [in the first part of the verse]. For it is the manner of Scripture to include both touching and carrying together, but here they are mentioned separately. Rather it is to teach that “[his garments] do not.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1[22]@p2<TIE>Which this person who became impure through contact with a corpse.@bo Meaning that there is a question as to which impure person the verse refers. Apparently the word @hh<HEB>הטמא@ee<ENG> ["the impure person"] refers to the person who was just mentioned, the one who touched the purifying waters. But this cannot be, because one who touches the purifying waters is impure only until the evening, thus he cannot contaminate another person. Rashi therefore answers that “the impure person” here refers to one who became impure through contact with a corpse and he “shall be ritually impure,” meaning that if he touches utensils then they will become impure. Rashi adds the word @hh<HEB>בו@ee<ENG> ["him"] to indicate what he touched. He also explains that the word @hh<HEB>בו@ee<ENG> refers to one who became impure through contact with a corpse and not to one who touched a person who became impure through contact with a corpse. @d1The one defiled by the corpse.@bo Meaning: Someone who touched another person who had become impure through contact with a corpse would become impure until the evening. Rashi asks: It is understandable that he could make utensils impure, because one who becomes impure through contact with a corpse has the status of a primary impurity and utensils can become impure through touching a primary impurity. However why would someone who touched this impure person become impure? Surely a person cannot become impure through touching a primary impurity, only from an @hh<HEB>אב הטומאה@ee<ENG> ["father of impurity"]? Rashi answers that “from here we learn.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1[2]@p2<TIE>Let the cow come and atone<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo You might ask: Surely a prosecutor cannot become a defender, for we similarly apply [this rule] concerning the golden vestments of the Kohein Gadol (Vayikra 16:4). He is forbidden to wear golden vestments when performing the service inside Holy of Holies because of the sin that was committed through gold. Here too surely the sin was done through the calf. The answer is that it was specifically regarding the service inside the Holy of Holies that it is forbidden because [we apply the principle that] a prosecutor cannot become a defender. For we see that [the Kohein Gadol] did serve wearing the golden vestments outside the Holy of Holies. Here too with the red cow, which was offered outside, it would not be fitting to say [the principle] that a prosecutor cannot become a defender. You might ask: Rashi below explains that the service of the red cow was not done by Aharon because [of the principle that] a prosecutor cannot become a defender! The answer is that Aharon is different, because the sin occurred through his [own] hand. However regarding the red cow, it is not @ITthis@it cow that was involved in the sin of the golden calf, only an animal of the same species. You might ask: In Parshas Shemini (Vayikra 9:2) it writes concerning Aharon, “Take a calf for yourself” and Rashi explains, "To show that Hashem had forgiven him for the incident with the golden calf.” [Surely there we see that] there was no difference between outside or inside the Holy of Holies. The answer is that there it refers to a case where he was atoning for himself, thus it was not appropriate to apply [the principle] that a prosecutor cannot become a defender, even though this was atoning for him regarding the sin of the golden calf. (@ITGur Aryeh@it) You might ask: What is the connection between the red cow, which purifies after becoming impure through contact with a corpse, and atonement for the incident with the golden calf? The answer is that if they had not sinned with the golden calf they would have lived forever, as is stated in the first chapter of [Tractate] Avodah Zarah (5a): Rabbi Yosi says: Yisroel only received the Torah in order that the Angel of Death would not rule over them, as it is written, “So that it will be good for you.” However, when they sinned, Hashem said, “Rather, you shall die like man.” Consequently we see that death itself is an inherent consequence of the golden calf, and thus Hashem said “Let the child’s mother [the cow, mother of the calf] come and wipe away [the filth].” This is why it is used for purification. @p1[9]@p2<TIE>Just as the calf defiled<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo Because [the transgression of] the calf was idolatry and idolatry makes one impure like one who becomes impure through contact with a corpse, as is written in Tehillim (106:28) “They attached themselves to Baal Peor and ate the sacrifices of the dead.” @p1[1]@p2<TIE>Those who were to die in the desert had already perished.@bo Rashi wishes to answer the question: Since the Torah writes “Bnei Yisroel” it is obvious that it was the “entire community.” He answers that “those who were to die in the desert had already perished,” [i.e., “the entire community” refers to those who were not destined to perish in the desert.]<QC>
@d1Why [is the portion concerning Miriam’s death] adjacent.@bo Meaning that this portion does not belong here, for they made the golden calf in the first year following the exodus from Egypt and in the second year they burned the red cow. But, Miriam’s death occurred at the end of the forty years after the exodus. @d1Just as sacrifices bring atonement.@bo You might ask: Was the red cow a sacrifice? Surely they did not offer any part of it [on the altar]! The answer is based on Rashi’s alternative interpretation above (19:9), that the Torah calls it a sin-offering in order to say that it is like the holy sacrifices in that it is forbidden for one to personally benefit from it. From there we learn that it is like a sacrifice. @d1So do the death of the righteous<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo You might ask: According to this, shouldn't the Torah have juxtaposed her death to the sacrifices themselves? The answer is that it is juxtaposed to the red cow because they are similar. The deaths of the righteous are not sacrifices, and the red cow is also not a sacrifice per se. Thus we learn one from the other, just as this one brings atonement, so too that one brings atonement. @d1By the Divine kiss.@bo Since it is written here @hh<HEB>שם@ee<ENG> ["there"], and concerning Aharon it is also written “Aharon died @hh<HEB>שם@ee<ENG> ["there"].” Because if it were not for the @ITgezeirah shavah@it [Scriptural comparison] why does the Torah write “@hh<HEB>שם@ee<ENG>” ["there"] twice regarding Miriam. Perforce it was for the @ITgezeirah shavah@it, to teach that just as there [Aharon died] by the Divine kiss, as it is written, “By the mouth of Hashem,” so too here it was by the Divine kiss. @d1Why then is it not said concerning her, “By the mouth of Hashem.”@bo There are those who ask: What was Rashi’s difficulty? Didn't he explain that we learn a @ITgezeirah shavah@it from Aharon through the word @hh<HEB>שם@ee<ENG> ["there"]? The answer is that Rashi is asking: Why is the @ITgezeirah shavah@it necessary? Let the Torah write, “By the mouth of Hashem” explicitly. For we are forced to say that it is not a full @ITgezeirah shavah@it, because if it is, why is it necessary to write “By the mouth of Hashem” regarding Aharon in order to teach that he died by the Divine kiss? We could have learned the @ITgezeirah shavah@it with the word “there” from Moshe. Rather it is certain that this is not a full @ITgezeirah shavah@it and therefore the Torah writes “By the mouth of Hashem” regarding Aharon. Consequently it should have also written “By the mouth of Hashem” for Miriam. Nonetheless, the Gemara (Moed Katan 28a) explicitly states that we learn the @ITgezeirah shavah@it from Moshe. Accordingly one must say that Rashi is saying as follows: “She too died by the Divine kiss” meaning that one learns a @ITgezeirah shavah@it from the word “there” [stated] regarding Moshe. However, regarding Aharon it says, “By the mouth of Hashem,” thus it is not necessary to learn this from Moshe. This was why Rashi says @hh<HEB>ובאהרן@ee<ENG> ["However, concerning Aharon"] rather than @hh<HEB>שבאהרן@ee<ENG> ["That was [said] about Aharon"]. @p1[2]@p2<TIE>The well in Miriam’s merit.@bo For immediately after Miriam died they no longer had water. You might ask: Why was the well not in Aharon’s or Moshe’s merit? The answer is that it was in the merit of Miriam waiting for Moshe by the water, to see what would happen to him when he was placed there in the box [as a baby] (Shemos 2:4). In return, this merit of the well, i.e., the water that Hashem provided for the congregation was on her behalf. @p1[3]@p2<TIE>We wish that we had died.@bo Meaning that this is similar to @hh<HEB>הן לו יהי כדבריך@ee<ENG> ["Would that it be like your words"] (Bereishis 30:34). However it is not in the sense of “perhaps” as in @hh<HEB>לו ישטמנו יוסף@ee<ENG> ["@ITPerhaps@it Yosef bears a grudge against us"] (Bereishis 50:15) and not in the sense of “if” as in @hh<HEB>לו הקשבת למצותי@ee<ENG> ["@ITIf@it you had paid attention to my commandments"] (Yeshayahu 48:18). @d1By our brothers’ death.@bo It is as if Scripture had said @hh<HEB>בגויעת@ee<ENG> ["By our brothers’ death"]. For if not so, and [the @ITvav@it] was part of the root, @hh<HEB>בגוע@ee<ENG> should have been spelled with a @ITcholam@it. And its meaning would be “At the time when our brothers died” like [the @ITkaf@it] in @hh<HEB>ויהי כשמוע לבן@ee<ENG> ["When Lavan heard"] (Bereishis 29:13).<QC>
@p1[8]@p2<TIE>From here .<TIE>.<TIE>. is solicitous of the [Israelites’] property.@bo You might ask: From where did Rashi derive this? Perhaps Hashem was answering their request when they asked why they and their livestock should die there, and Hashem answered, “Give drink to the community and their livestock.” The answer is that the term @hh<HEB>השקית@ee<ENG> (lit. "you will give water") refers to animals, as it is written in Parshas Chaye Sarah (Bereishis 24:14) “@hh<HEB>וגם גמליך אשקה@ee<ENG>” ["And I will also water your camels"]. Thus the Torah should have said “@hh<HEB>וישתו העדה@ee<ENG>” ["Let the community drink"] as it writes shortly (v. 11) “@hh<HEB>ותשת העדה@ee<ENG>” ["And the community drank"] because the term @hh<HEB>שתייה@ee<ENG> ["drinking"] refers to people, as it is also written “@hh<HEB>שתה אדוני@ee<ENG>” ["Let my master drink"] (Bereishis 24:18). However, since Scripture modifies its wording and writes @hh<HEB>והשקית@ee<ENG> ["And give drink"] it is certainly because “[Hashem] is solicitous of the Israelites’ property.” (@ITMahari@it) Also one may answer that Rashi is answering the question: Why is it necessary for the Torah to state “And their livestock”? For in Parshas Beshalach (Shemos 17:3) when Hashem answered Moshe’s request for water, He answered only that the @ITpeople@it would drink, and the answer was despite Yisroel having said “To kill me and my children and my @ITlivestock@it [through thirst].” If so, why does it state, “And their livestock”? Rather it was because “[Hashem] is solicitous.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (@ITKitzur@it @ITMizrochi@it) Hashem said @hh<HEB>בעירם@ee<ENG> ["@ITtheir@it livestock"] with a @ITmem@it. Thus we learn that He is solicitous of them because they are the Israelites’ livestock, and not merely because they are animals. For if not so, it should have said “Give drink to the community and the animals”! This answer is also apparent from @ITDivrei Dovid@it. @p1[10]@p2<TIE>Where a small area held<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Would it be possible to assemble the entire community before the rock?<QC>
@d1Because they did not recognize it.@bo Rashi is answering the question: What reason did they have for saying “Can we [extract] from this rock.<TIE>.<TIE>.”? Since Hashem had said it will give water it would certainly happen! He answers that it was “because they did not recognize it.” The Israelites were asking them, “What difference is it to you from which rock you extract [water]?” Meaning: What difference is there between this rock and another one? Therefore he said to them.<TIE>.<TIE>. @p1[11]@p2<TIE>Because at first .<TIE>.<TIE>. only drops.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Why did he strike it twice? He answers that this was because after striking it once it only produced drops. His proof is that if it had not produced anything, why would he have stuck it a second time? Also, why would he not have thought that it was a different rock, about which Hashem had not commanded them? Conversely, if at first it had produced abundant water, they would not have had to strike it a second time. Rather, it is certain that at first it produced drops and therefore he struck it a second time. The reason why it did not produce sufficient water immediately was “Because [the Omnipresent] had not.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Rashi adds “They spoke.<TIE>.<TIE>.” so that Moshe’s mistake be known, that he struck it. Because they had spoken to a different rock and it had not produced water. Consequently he struck the rock, because they said, “Perhaps.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Rashi adds that they happened upon [that rock] because if this were not so, why would it have even produced drops? Even after many strikes it should not have produced even one drop of water! Rather, “They happened upon [that rock].<TIE>.<TIE>.” There is a minor difficulty based on Rashi’s explanation in Parshas Matos concerning the verse (Bamidbar 31:21) “Elozor the Kohein said.<TIE>.<TIE>.” [There he states]: “Because Moshe fell into a state of anger he fell into a state of error.<TIE>.<TIE>. similar to ‘listen now rebels.<TIE>.<TIE>. he struck the rock’ and because of anger he came to a state of error.” This implies that it was not because they had spoken to another rock and it had not produced water, and that they thought perhaps Hashem’s command was to strike it, like Rashi writes here. The answer may be that these are Midrashim that disagree with each other and Rashi brings both, as is his practice. @ITRe’m@it. @p1[12]@p2<TIE>Scripture reveals<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo Rashi wishes to answer the question: Is it respectful to reveal the disgrace of the righteous? He answers that on the contrary it is to their credit that the Scripture reveals this “so that it would not be said of them.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @d1If it had not been for this single sin.@bo Rashi is troubled by the fact that the word @hh<HEB>יען@ee<ENG> ["because"] seems to explain what was stated previously. I.e., it has the connotation of, “If it were not for.” He answers that “if it had not been for.<TIE>.<TIE>.” means that it was @ITonly@it because they did this [that they were punished]. @ITRe’m@it writes: You might ask: Even without this sin he would not have entered the land because a decree had already been place upon him, as it states (Shemos 6:1) “@ITNow@it you will see.<TIE>.<TIE>.” [and Rashi comments:] “But not what is done to the thirty one kings.” For the answer see Parshas Beha'aloscha (Bamidbar 10:29) where I wrote on the verse, “We are journeying.<TIE>.<TIE>.” that Rashi’s words there are like his answer here. Therefore I have not brought the answer of the @ITRe’m@it here. @d1Like the transgressions of the rest of the generation of the desert.@bo Meaning: One should not explain that they were also guilty of the sins of the generation of the desert, for they were great sins such as those who complained and the other matters as well. @d1Was not “Will sheep and cattle be slaughtered” worse than this@bo? For there Moshe implied that Hashem did not have the power to give them enough meat. Here Moshe merely said that he did not have permission to bring water from a [different] rock [than the one] about which he had been commanded. [The answer is:] This [statement about the rock] gave the people reason to believe that the water came out because of the rock and its own attributes, not because of Hashem’s decree. Because what difference does it make to Hashem whether it is this rock or another. Thus their sin was only that they did not rely on Hashem, that He would bring water out from any rock they wished, even though it was not the one about which they had been commanded. @d1He swore precipitously.@bo Meaning on His own, without any need — for surely they had not [yet] stood before Him in prayer. @p1[14]@p2<TIE>Because of the bill of debt<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo Meaning: Hashem said to Avraham, “Your offspring will be strangers…” (Bereishis 15:13). However He placed the decree of being slaves in the land of Egypt upon Yaakov and his sons alone. Thus, "We endured the suffering of the enslavement on behalf of Esav your father, and his children. Consequently it is fitting for you to allow us passage through your land." Rashi explains this shortly [in his commentary] on the words, “Let us pass through your land…” (v. 17).<QC>
@p1[15]@p2<TIE>We endured much suffering.@bo (@ITGur Aryeh@it) Though the term @hh<HEB>וירעו@ee<ENG> ["they mistreated"] merely implies that they did one evil act to them, but elsewhere (Devarim 26:6) it is written, “They mistreated us @ITand@it afflicted us.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Therefore Rashi explains that @hh<HEB>וירעו@ee<ENG> includes much suffering, and thus all afflictions are included. @d1That the forefathers suffer.@bo Because if it is referring to the forefathers who were in the land of Egypt, Scripture should have placed “forefathers” before “us” and said, “They mistreated our forefathers and us.” However, since Scripture wrote “forefathers” at the end, it implies that it refers to a something else (@ITMahari@it). (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) For one cannot explain that it refers to the forefathers who were enslaved in Egypt, given that this is so obvious that one would not have to mention it. Rather, it certainly refers to the forefathers who are mentioned at the beginning of the verse that states, “Our forefathers went down to Egypt.” This raises the following difficulty: During the period that any one of the sons of Yaakov was alive there was no enslavement, if so what is meant by “they mistreated [.<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>our forefathers]”? Perforce it is to say that “the forefathers suffer.<TIE>.<TIE>.” and accordingly one is able to explain that Avraham, Yitzchak and Yaakov also suffer. @p1[16]@p2<TIE>Through the blessing .<TIE>.<TIE>. “The voice is the voice of Yaakov.”@bo From the answer that the king of Edom gave to Moshe we see that Moshe said to him, “Through the blessing.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Meaning: The Torah writes shortly (v.18), “Lest I go out against you with the sword.” There Rashi explains the reason that he responded, “You pride yourselves.<TIE>.<TIE>.” This proves that Moshe [first] said to him, “Through the blessing.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (@ITDevek Tov@it) For if not so, when Moshe said, “We cried out to Hashem.<TIE>.<TIE>.” he should merely have said, “Hashem heard and He sent.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Why did he mention “our voice”? Rather, it was “through the blessing.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @d1This refers to Moshe.@bo Rashi is answering the question: But it was Moshe who took them out! So Rashi explains “from here.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1[17]@p2<TIE>You should not challenge<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo Rashi wishes to answer the question: Why did Moshe need to mention to the king of Edom about the exodus from Egypt as well as the entire section written beforehand? @d1Although we have in our possession manna to eat.@bo Rashi mentions “manna to eat” even though the verse only writes about water, because Rashi is answering the question: If he had not spoken the king of Edom about food, what benefit would they have in them purchasing water, since this was of minor benefit to them? Rather, Moshe must have also said that they would purchase food from them. The reason that the verse specifically mentions water was to teach something additional; that they also wished to purchase water from them, even though it was not customary to purchase water. We see that from Yirmeyahu who lamented (Eichah 5:4), “We drank our water for money” (@ITMahari@it). @d1We will muzzle.@bo (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) Rashi is answering the question: Had they not already said, “We will not pass through any field or vineyard”? [The answer is] that certainly above it refers to their passage on foot but here it is referring to a diversion [from the road] to eat. @p1[18]@p2<TIE>With my forefather’s legacy.@bo For if not so, why mention the @ITsword@it. He should have said, “I will go out against you to @ITwar@it.”<QC>
@p1[20]@p2<TIE>With our grandfather’s assurance.@bo For if not so, why does it say “a strong hand.” Any massive number of people constitutes a strong hand. @p1[22]@p2<TIE>All of them, perfect.@bo You might ask: Why does Rashi not comment in the same manner he did above on the phrase “The entire community” (v. 1)? Also, why is it necessary to mention that all of them were perfect [and ready] to enter the land? Furthermore, it was not necessary to explain that “these were among those.<TIE>.<TIE>.” The answer is that it was [necessary] so that you would not ask: Why does Scripture write, “The entire community” teaching that the entire community is designated for life, since those who were destined to die in the wilderness had already perished, since the Torah had written above “the entire community”? Therefore Rashi explains that it is to tell you that even at the time they entered the land, which was some time after the death of the generation of the desert, “All of them were perfect.<TIE>.<TIE>.”<QC>
@p1[26]@p2<TIE>In the vestments of the @BIKehunah Gedolah.@bo Rashi wishes to answer the question: If it was his regular clothes, why did Hashem command Moshe to dress Elozor in [Aharon's] clothes in his presence. @ITRe’m@it answers that one must say that this refers to the vestments of the @ITKehunah@it [@ITGedolah@it]. If not so, how would this be a sign that [Elozor] merited the @ITKehunah@it @ITGedolah@it? It is possible that [he meant] my answer within his. @d1He dressed him and then removed them from him.@bo Even though it does not write here that Hashem commanded this, for it is only written, “Remove Aharon’s [vestments].” Otherwise, if Moshe had not dressed him first, how could Aharon have worn the vestments of the @ITkehunah@it during a time when he was not performing any service? Surely one who leaves the Temple Mount wearing the vestments of @ITkehunah@it receives forty lashes [for transgressing a Torah prohibition]. Rather one must say that Moshe dressed him per Hashem’s instruction in order that he could remove them and place them on Elozor in Aharon’s presence. This was to demonstrate that his son Elozor had merited the @ITKehunah Gedolah@it in Aharon’s place. @d1He said to him “Enter the cave.”@bo Rashi is answering the question: Why did Aharon himself not remove his clothes and place them on Elozor? It seems insulting for Moshe to have to serve them. He answers that, “He said to him.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Would it not have been sufficient without mentioning Moshe’s words? Rather, it was to demonstrate the commandment of doing kindness to the dead, and that Moshe himself dealt with all matters pertaining to the death of Aharon. @p1[27]@p2<TIE>Although the matter was difficult for him.@bo For if not so, why is it necessary to say “Moshe did.<TIE>.<TIE>.”? Would one have thought that he would transgress the charge of the Omnipresent? @ITRe’m@it writes: I do not know why Rashi did not make this comment in Parshas Korach where it is written (Bamidbar 17:26) “Moshe did as Hashem commanded Moshe, so he did.” It is possible that he did not comment there because one may say that he did so happily and for his own benefit, so that Bnei Yisroel would not again come to dispute the elevation of the tribe of Levi. There [the happiness due to] the love over his tribe’s elevation was joined with his performance of this commandment, even though he was also doing the command of Hashem. Consequently there Rashi did not wish to make any comment. @p1[29]@p2<TIE>When they saw Moshe<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo Rashi wishes to answer the question: Surely they did not see Aharon’s death, for only Moshe and Elozor [witnessed it]. The Torah then should have said “they heard.<TIE>.<TIE>.” given that they heard this from Moshe and Elozor. Rashi explains, “When they saw.<TIE>.<TIE>.” [Rashi continues:] The ministering angels showed them. This is what was meant by “the entire community saw.” @d1Because Aharon<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo Rashi wishes to answer the question: Why concerning the death of Moshe is it written “all of Yisroel cried” while here concerning [the death of] Aharon it is written “the entire @IThouse @itof Yisroel”? He explains that here even the women cried, because Aharon [pursued peace.<TIE>.<TIE>.].<QC>
@p1[1]@p2<TIE>He heard that Aharon died and [the clouds of glory] departed.@bo You might ask: What is Rashi’s source for this? Perhaps [the explanation of the verse] is like its plain understanding, that it was because “Yisroel had come.<TIE>.<TIE>.” as the verse continues. The answer is that Rashi is answering the question: Why does it say, “He heard”? It should have merely said “Yisroel came by the route of the spies and the Cannanite King of Arad came and attacked.<TIE>.<TIE>.” As the Torah writes (Shemos 17:8) “Amalek came and attacked Yisroel” and (Bamidbar 21:23) “[They] went out against Yisroel to the wilderness; he came to Yohatz and attacked Yisroel.” Similarly it says regarding Og (ibid. v. 33), “He came out against Yisroel, [he with all his people] to wage war at Edre’i.” Rather, it was because they heard that Aharon died and the Clouds of Glory departed. Furthermore one can answer that Rashi’s proof is from Parshas Masei (Bamidbar 33:40) where it is written, “The Canaanites heard.<TIE>.<TIE>.after Aharon’s death.” There it is clear that it was only because they had heard that Aharon had died and that the Divine Presence had departed from Yisroel. Rashi explains on that verse, “From here you learn.<TIE>.<TIE>.” The words, “From here” imply that he is explaining that his proof is from there, as I will explain there. @ITRe’m@it explains: It is written above @hh<HEB>וַיִּרְאוּ כל העדה@ee<ENG> ["The entire community saw.<TIE>.<TIE>."] (20:29) and Rabbi Abahu says (Rosh Hashanah 3a): Read this as @hh<HEB>וַיֵרְאוּ@ee<ENG> ["and they feared"] with a @ITtzerei@it under the @ITyud@it in accordance with Reish Lakish who says that here the word @hh<HEB>כי@ee<ENG> [translated in 20:29 as "that" but sometimes meaning "because"] comes to explain the matter that precedes it. [Consequently it means that they were fearful] since the community had become vulnerable because of Aharon’s death. It appears that this was why Rashi reversed the order of the verse and explained (20:29) “that [Aharon] had died” after “the entire community of Yisroel” in order to juxtapose it to the comment, “And the Canaanite heard.” @ITR. Yaakov Triosh@it. @d1This was Amalek.@bo Rashi explains this so that you should not pose the difficulty that the verse is contradictory, for it is written, “The Canaanite [king] heard” and afterwards it is written “who lived in the south” which refers to Amalek. [To resolve the difficulty] he explains, “They changed.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @d1The great pathfinder.@bo This refers to the Ark, meaning that once they saw that the Clouds of Glory had departed and [the Israelites] only had the Holy Ark traveling before them, they came to attack, something that they had not done previously. @ITRe’m@it. The other interpretation was necessary because according to the first reason there is the difficulty as to why is it written, “The route of the spies.” Did the spies establish that route? Surely it had been established for anyone to pass through. Therefore Rashi brought the other interpretation. Accordingly, Rashi brings the other interpretation and as @ITRe’m@it explains, that it was because only the Ark traveled before them, but the Clouds of Glory had departed that [the Amalekites] came to attack. However, according to the other interpretation there is the difficulty as to why the Torah writes @hh<HEB>האתרים@ee<ENG> in the plural form, since it was referring only to the Holy Ark [which is singular]. Therefore Rashi also brings the first interpretation. @d1One maidservant.@bo Rashi had to explain so because the Rabbis state that Yisroel can only be defeated at a time when they act corruptly before Hashem. But here we do not find any corrupt behavior. Therefore he says that the captive who was taken here was merely the captive whom Yisroel captured from them. We need not ask how Rashi knew that there was only one, when perhaps there were two. For one can answer that the term @hh<HEB>שבי@ee<ENG> ["captive"] implies that there was only one. You might also ask how Rashi knew that the captive was a maidservant. The answer is that the term @hh<HEB>שבי@ee<ENG> implies a maidservant. For in Parshas Bo concerning the warning [before the tenth plague] it is written, “From the firstborn of Pharoh who sits on his throne to the firstborn of the maidservant.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (Shemos 11:5). Whereas later, when the plague struck, it is written “Until the firstborn of the @hh<HEB>שבי@ee<ENG> [captive]” (Shemos 12:29). Thus one must explain that @hh<HEB>שבי@ee<ENG> there refers to the firstborn of the maidservant and therefore the word @hh<HEB>שבי@ee<ENG> written here also refers to a maidservant. For if not so, Scripture should have clarified [whether] he took men, women or children from them. @p1[2]@p2<TIE>I shall consecrate the spoils.@bo For if [it is explained] like the plain understanding [implying destruction], what kind of vow would it be to destroy their cities? Surely a plain vow to Hashem refers to consecration of property. Rather this expression means, “I shall consecrate.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Rashi comments further (v. 3), that according to this explanation that @hh<HEB>ויחרם@ee<ENG> refers to consecration to heaven, it would not be appropriate to say this in reference to people, as the verse continues “@ITthem@it and their cities.” Therefore Rashi explains that when [@hh<HEB>ויחרם@ee<ENG>] refers to people it is in the sense of killing [them], but when it refers to cities it is in the sense of consecration to heaven. @p1[4]@p2<TIE>Since Aharon had died<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo Rashi is answering the question: What is meant by “they traveled from Mount Hor by the Reed Sea route.<TIE>.<TIE>.”? Surely before they came to Mount Hor they were circling around the land of Edom, as it is written “Edom refused.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (above 20:21). Thus it is evident that they had already turned back [in order to circle around Edom]. So why does it say now that they turned back? Rashi answers that “since Aharon died.<TIE>.<TIE>..” @d1But they returned there .<TIE>.<TIE>. and eulogized him.@bo You might ask: Why did they eulogize him at Moseirah? The answer is that in Parshas Pinchos (Bamidbar 26:13) and Parshas Eikev (Devarim 10:6) Rashi explains why they eulogized him at Moseirah. This is the essence of his words: When they returned to Moseirah, the Levites chased after them until Moseirah and killed several families, as Rashi explains in Parshas Pinchos. Thus they eulogized him there because it was due to Aharon’s death that the Clouds of Glory departed from them, leading the Canaanites to hear and come to attack them. This caused them to return to Moseirah, and because they returned, several families were killed. Consequently they eulogized him there, given that it was due to his death that all of these events befell them, as I explained. The reason why here Rashi explains that they turned back seven journeys, while in Parshas Pinchos he explains that they turned back eight journeys is explained elsewhere (Bamidbar 26:13). Here it means aside from the last journey there were seven journeys.<QC>
@p1[5]@p2<TIE>The manna will eventually swell.@bo Rashi explains “it will swell” because the Torah writes @hh<HEB>הקלוקל@ee<ENG> ["this rotten"] with a @ITcholam@it, which literally implies a sense of decay. This was why they said that it would swell in their stomachs. When he explains that it was absorbed into the limbs, this was because it is written @hh<HEB>קלקל@ee<ENG> in the shortened form [without a @ITvav@it] which implies the sense of @hh<HEB>קל@ee<ENG> ["light"], implying that one did not have to digest it. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) This is Rashi’s comment from Avodah Zarah 5a: “With this rotten bread — this is the manna because it was absorbed into their limbs and not excreted they called it rotten.<TIE>.<TIE>.” From there one sees that it is in the sense of lightness, similar to @hh<HEB>ירקרק@ee<ENG> or @hh<HEB>אדמדם@ee<ENG> ["yellowish" or "reddish" which are variations on the words @hh<HEB>ירק@ee<ENG> ["yellow"] and @hh<HEB>אדום@ee<ENG> ["red"] formed by doubling the root]. [It appears that] @ITRe’m@it overlooked this Rashi. @d1Can anyone .<TIE>.<TIE>. without excreting.@bo You might ask: Is it not written (Devarim 23:14), “You shall have a shovel aside from your weapons, and it shall be when you sit outside.<TIE>.<TIE>.”? From there it seems that they did excrete. The answer is that they excreted [food] purchased from the merchants [not the manna]. @p1[6]@p2<TIE>That consume.@bo Meaning that @hh<HEB>השרפים@ee<ENG> ["the consuming"] is a description of the snakes that are mentioned in the verse, meaning “the snakes that consume.” Not that this was a species of snake such as @hh<HEB>שרף מעופף@ee<ENG> ["a flying seraph" (Yeshayahu 14:29)] or @hh<HEB>נחש שרף ועקרב@ee<ENG> ["snake, saraph and scorpion" (Devarim 8:15)]. For if this were so the verse should have said @hh<HEB>והשרפים@ee<ENG> ["@ITand @itthe seraphim"]. [One might ask:] It is written, (v. 8) “Make yourself a @hh<HEB>שרף@ee<ENG> ["consuming snake"]” which implies that it was a species of snake called the saraph. The answer is that it means “make for yourself a consuming snake” for we find something similar [that an adjective implies a subject that is not stated explicitly in the verse] where @hh<HEB>מאכלו בריא@ee<ENG> ["his food is healthy"] (Chabakuk 1:16), refers to a healthy sheep. @p1[8]@p2<TIE>Because it is [held high] .<TIE>.<TIE>. it is called a banner.@bo Meaning that it is usual for one to signal with a pole by the placement of a signal on it, given that a pole is high, therefore a pole is called a banner. @d1Even if a dog.@bo For if this were not so, why was it necessary to write @hh<HEB>כל@ee<ENG> ["anyone"], surely it should have merely written “one bitten.” @d1Deteriorate.@bo In the sense of becoming ill, meaning that the body progressively shriveled and he did not die immediately. (Bava Kamma 52). @d1Can a snake bring death .<TIE>.<TIE>. and subjugated their hearts<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo (@ITKitzur Mizrochi@it) You might ask: If so, why did Hashem tell Moshe to make the snake given that it was dependant upon whether they directed [their hearts etc.]? @ITRamban@it has already answered that it was a miracle within a miracle, because when one has been injured by something it is normally dangerous for him to see or to gaze at it. Furthermore, doctors are careful not to mention the thing that caused the injury in front of him. However Hashem said that “anyone bitten will look at it and live” which is contrary to nature, to teach that it is not the snake that brings death, rather it is sin that brings death. (@ITGur Aryeh@it) writes that He commanded Moshe to place it on the banner in order that they would look upward, for then it would be impossible for one not to direct his heart toward heaven concerning this matter and to see who had brought it about. Accordingly when Hashem said [specifically] to make a snake, this was because when one sees the thing that injured him fear overtakes him. Consequently he concentrates more in prayer over the thing that injured him when he sees it before his eyes. @p1[9]@p2<TIE>Snake.@bo @ITRamban@it writes: I do not understand this, for surely Hashem only said “Make yourself a @hh<HEB>שרף@ee<ENG> ["snake"].” Rather they mean that Moshe followed the essential name. His answer appears to be that since the essential name that Hashem gave to the snake was @hh<HEB>נחש@ee<ENG> [@ITnachash@it]. Why then was it called @hh<HEB>שרף@ee<ENG> here? Consequently, Moshe said [to himself] “Hashem is surely hinting to me by referring to it with a descriptive name and not the essential name,” in order to make the snake from copper [@ITnachash nechoshes@it], so that it [also] alludes to the essential name. @p1[11]@p2<TIE>I do not know.@bo Meaning, I do not know @ITwhy@it this place was called “the wasteland passes.” However I do know the meaning of @hh<HEB>עיי@ee<ENG> as Rashi explains. @d1With a broom.@bo Meaning swept with a broom. This is in the sense of @hh<HEB>יעים@ee<ENG> ["scoops"] (Bamidbar 4:14) with which one sweeps out ashes. @d1For those crossing Mount Nevo.@bo Rashi is answering the question: The term “passes” implies a point they are crossing over to another area, but to where were they crossing over? He answers that “This was the passage route for those crossing Mount Nevo.<TIE>.<TIE>.” because in Parshas Haazinu (Devarim 32:49) it is also written, “This [mountain] pass, Mount Nevo.” @p1[13]@p2<TIE>The edge of [their] border.@bo Rashi was obliged to explain that this refers to a border and is not in the sense of a territory [the word @hh<HEB>גבול@ee<ENG> ["border"] sometimes includes the territory enclosed by the border]. For if it was the territory of the Emorites then it could not be the territory of the Moavites, and if it was the territory of the Moavites then it could not be the territory of the Emorites. However a border can be a boundary for both.<QC>
@p1[14]@p2<TIE>Concerning this encampment.@bo Meaning, concerning the miracles performed in this encampment. [The Sifsei Chachamim proceeds to explain the somewhat cryptic language used in the next two verses:] The meaning of @hh<HEB>בספר@ee<ENG> ["in the book"] is “In the book of stories.” The meaning of @hh<HEB>והב@ee<ENG> ["gave"] is @hh<HEB>יהב@ee<ENG> which means “gave.” The meaning of @hh<HEB>בסופה@ee<ENG> ["at the reeds"] is “at the Reed Sea.” The meaning of @hh<HEB>ואת הנחלים@ee<ENG> ["and the valleys"] is “the miracles of the valleys.” The meaning of @hh<HEB>ארנון@ee<ENG> ["Arnon"] is “of Arnon.” The meaning of @hh<HEB>ואשד@ee<ENG> is “spillage.” The meaning of @hh<HEB>ואשד הנחלים@ee<ENG> is that it is a description of “the valleys of Arnon.” The meaning of @hh<HEB>אשר נטה@ee<ENG> ["when it turned.<TIE>.<TIE>."] is that the Mountain at Ar was uprooted from its place. @p1[15]@p2<TIE>When the Israelites came to pass through, the Eretz Yisroel mountain was set in tremor.@bo (@ITGur Aryeh@it) You might ask: The mountain should have returned to its place immediately, such that the Israelites would have seen the dead in the valley. Why then did the mountain only return to its place after they had passed through? The answer is that it is not proper for one who receives his master to return to his place until his master passes, therefore [the mountain] did not return to its place until the Israelites had passed. @ITKitzur Mizrochi@it raises a difficulty: We need not ask that surely the cloud went before them, flattening any heights and raising any low places, and as a result the mountain should have returned immediately. Here we cannot answer that the cloud had already departed at Aharon’s death, for the Gemara in Maseches Taanis (9a) states that it returned in the merit of Moshe. Nonetheless, this is not a difficulty because the cloud traveled three days journey ahead of them, thus it is possible that at the time of passing through, the mountain had not yet accomplished its task of killing those who gathered there. Consequently the cloud did not level out the mountain. @p1[17]@p2<TIE>From within the valley.@bo Rashi says “from within the valley” because one always arises from a low place to a higher place. And because the meaning of the word “arise” was not that it would come up, rather that the limbs would come forth so that Yisroel should be aware of the miracles that were done for them, Rashi added the words “and lift.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Nonetheless, since by arising it would lift up, the Torah wrote @hh<HEB>עלי@ee<ENG> ["arise"] rather than @hh<HEB>העלי@ee<ENG> ["lift"]. @d1Was it from there?@bo Meaning: The Torah says (v. 18), “From the wilderness as a gift,” meaning that it was given to them at the time they came into the wilderness.<QC>
@p1[20]@p2<TIE>As there Moshe died.@bo Meaning: Since it mentioned here (v. 19), “The gift [traveled] to the valley” it also mentioned that the well traveled on to the heights, and from the heights to the valley, even though these journeys had not yet happened. Once the well is mentioned here, the Torah relates everything about it. Consequently, once we see that [after the valley] it did not travel any further with them, Rashi gives the reason for this saying “Moshe died there and it was discontinued.” @ITRe’m@it @d1And there the well was discontinued.@bo You might ask: Was the well not discontinued when Miriam died, as stated above (20:2)? The answer is that it returned in the merit of Moshe, and when he died, it [permanently] stopped (Taanis 9a). @d1Why is Moshe not mentioned<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo You might ask: Above, immediately in the beginning of the song “It was then that Yisroel sang” (v. 17). Rashi should have asked why Moshe was not mentioned as well. The answer is that one might have thought that it was because he sinned at the well, as it is written above that he struck the rock (20:11). Consequently [one would say that] the Torah did not wish to mention him in this song which refers to the well, as Rashi explains. However now that he explains that @hh<HEB>במחוקק@ee<ENG> ["through the lawgiver"] refers to Moshe, [Rashi asks] why Moshe was not mentioned explicitly in the song. @d1That peak.@bo Because we cannot say that it refers to the valley, given that @hh<HEB>גיא@ee<ENG> ["valley"] is in the masculine form while @hh<HEB>ונשקפה@ee<ENG> ["that overlooks"] is in the feminine form. @d1Another interpretation: The well may be seen.@bo Because @hh<HEB>באר@ee<ENG> ["well"] is in the feminine form. The other interpretation is necessary because according to the first reason there is the difficulty that the entire passage deals with the well, so how could one explain that @hh<HEB>ונשקפה@ee<ENG> ["that overlooks"] refers to the peak? Consequently Rashi brings the other interpretation. However, according to the other interpretation there is the difficulty that it should have said @hh<HEB>ונשקפה מן הישימון@ee<ENG> ["that looks out @ITfrom@it the wastelands"], but what is the meaning of @hh<HEB>על פני@ee<ENG> ["@ITover@it the wastelands"]? Consequently Rashi brings the first reason also. @p1[22]@p2<TIE>Although they were not commanded<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo Meaning that although they were not commanded to do so, they made this request since they only wished to make a temporary traversal [of the land]. It was not similar to the surrounding cities where the Torah forbade [them to make peace] (see Devarim 20:16-17). @ITRe’m@it, @ITNachalas Yaakov, Gur Aryeh@it and @ITDivrei Dovid@it all raise the difficulty that surely Sichon was king of the Emorites and thus included among the seven nations. Therefore, why did they offer a peace overture given that in reference to the seven nations the Torah writes, “You shall not allow any soul to live” (ibid.)? The answer is that even in the Land of Israel itself, the prohibition, “You shall not allow any soul to live” only applies once they had already begun the war. Thus when it is taught that Yehoshua sent three messages to the Land of Israel, the first of which was “whoever wishes to make peace, come and make peace” it was before they had begun the war. @p1[23]@p2<TIE>Delivered tribute to him.@bo For if not so, surely they only requested to pass through their land. [Thus it is understandable that] Sichon did not allow them to pass, but why did he go out to fight against them? (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it, @ITGur Aryeh@it and @ITKitzur Mizrochi@it) Rashi needed this answer to explain [a difficulty:] It was understandable that the king of Edom would dispute the inheritance of the Land of Israel, being certain [of his strength] due to the assurance of his ancestor, and also because they sent an appeasing message, “Let us please pass” in terms of a request. However regarding Sichon there is the difficulty as to why he was so confident? Surely it would have been better for him not to wage war with Yisroel. Therefore Rashi answers that “all the Canaanite kings delivered tribute to him.” @d1Why should I inconvenience<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Why did Sichon go out against them to wage war? Surely he had no reason to fear given that even “if the city of Cheshbon had been filled with gnats.<TIE>.<TIE>.” and similarly “if Sichon had been alone in a village.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Furthermore the verse continues, “And he gathered all of his people.” This implies [that he gathered] all of the people in the land, but this was not proper practice. On the contrary he should have brought all his troops into the cities in order to protect them. Thus Rashi explains “The Holy One Blessed Is He said.<TIE>.<TIE>.”<QC>
@p1[27]@p2<TIE>Cheshbon under Sichon’s name.@bo “May it be built and established” refers to Cheshbon mentioned above, not to “as the city of Sichon.” For after he had conquered and taken possession of it, what need was there to say “may it be built and established”? Rather, this is what the parable tellers were saying: Sichon and his people come to the city of Cheshbon, for you can overcome it, given that from the beginning when it was built it was established as the city of Sichon. It was built under Sichon’s name, meaning that from then it was already decreed to be the city of Sichon. Thus “May it be built and established” is in the future tense in place of the past tense. @p1[28]@p2<TIE>After Sichon conquered it.@bo But not beforehand, for if so, it should have said “A fire came @ITto Cheshbon@it.” @d1Ar, belonging to Moav.@bo Rashi says this so that you should not think that @hh<HEB>ער@ee<ENG> ["Ar"] was in the sense of @hh<HEB>עיר@ee<ENG> ["city"]. This would be similar to @hh<HEB>דם@ee<ENG> ["blood"] the plural form of which is @hh<HEB>דמים@ee<ENG>; so too, the plural form of @hh<HEB>ער@ee<ENG> would be @hh<HEB>ערים@ee<ENG> ["cities"]. Thus @hh<HEB>ער@ee<ENG> would be the general title for all of Moav’s cities. However this would not be possible because Moav still had many cities which they ruled over. Furthermore it cannot refer to one of their cities because if so, Scripture should have mentioned which city, as is its usual practice, given that it does not come to conceal but rather to explain. Rashi brings a proof from the [Onkelos’s] translation which is @hh<HEB>לחיית@ee<ENG> [the proper noun "Lechayas"] rather than @hh<HEB>קרתא@ee<ENG> ["city"]. @ITRe’m@it writes: It appears to me that this was Rashi’s intention: The proper name of a city is not normally used in the construct form [@ITsemichus@it, as here where two nouns are juxtaposed indicating possession], and given that Ar is the proper name of a country, it should not have been used in the construct form. Because of this question one might have felt forced to explain that @hh<HEB>ער@ee<ENG> is in the sense of @hh<HEB>עיר@ee<ENG> ["city"]. However, [Rashi indicates that] one should not explain so, given that it is preferable to explain that it was an individual city which was placed in the construct form, although this is not typical. [This is preferable] rather than explaining that it is in the sense of “city,” due to the difficulties that this would entail. @p1[29]@p2<TIE>That he be delivered into his hands.@bo Meaning that this verse is related to, “May it be built and established” (v. 27), as if to say that since the city was built for Sichon, ultimately it would be handed over to him. @d1As far as Divon.@bo Rashi explains that @hh<HEB>עד@ee<ENG> ["as far as"] is in the sense of @hh<HEB>סר@ee<ENG> ["removed"] as if to say “the kingdom was removed from Divon” because one cannot explain @hh<HEB>אבד חשבון עד דיבון@ee<ENG> like the simple understanding that the entire area from Cheshbon as far as Divon was uprooted. For if so, the word @hh<HEB>ונירם@ee<ENG>, which means “their kingdom,” would not be connected to what comes before or after it. However, according to Rashi’s explanation it is as if it is written “their kingdom in Cheshbon was uprooted and their kingdom in Divon was removed.” @p1[32]@p2<TIE>The spies captured it.@bo Since it is written “@ITthey@it captured its surrounding villages” with @hh<HEB>וילכדו@ee<ENG> ["@ITthey @itcaptured"] in the plural form, rather than @hh<HEB> @hhוילכד@ee<ENG>["@IThe@it captured"] in the singular form, as it does shortly where it is written @hh<HEB>ויורש@ee<ENG> ["and @IThe @itinherited"] in the singular. Rather [this implies that] the spies captured the surrounding villages. @p1[34]@p2<TIE>Moshe was afraid [to do battle] that perhaps the merit<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo For if not so, why was Og any different from Sichon? Regarding Sichon, Hashem did not say “do not be afraid of him.” You might ask: Surely Og’s intentions were purely evil, [namely] that Avrohom would be killed and he would marry Sarah, as Rashi explains in Parshas Lech Lecha on the verse, “The one who had escaped came.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (Bereishis 14:13). The answer is that nonetheless, since the merit of saving Lot came through his hand, Moshe was afraid that this merit might stand for him, even though his intentions were evil. Similarly we say (Horiyos 10b) that in the merit of the sacrifices that Balak offered, he merited that Rus [Ruth] would come from him, even though his intentions were evil. This was because he offered them in honor of Hashem.<QC>
@p1[2]@p2<TIE>He said “Those two kings.<TIE>.<TIE>.”@bo Rashi is answering the question: Was he the [only one]@IT@it who saw but others did not see? Rather, he took it to heart and therefore the Torah associates the sighting with him. Alternatively, Rashi is answering a [different] question: The Torah should have stated, “And he heard,” given that presumably he did not partake in the war. Rather, “And he saw” is an expression of comprehension, and what was it that he comprehended? “He said.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @d1Certainly we cannot.@bo Rashi is answering the question: How was, “And Moav became terrified” (v. 3) a result of, “And Balak saw.<TIE>.<TIE>.”? For the verse implies that it was because of him seeing that Moav became terrified. Rashi answers: “Those two kings.<TIE>.<TIE>.” referring to Sichon and Og. He means to say that once the general populace heard that the king had said this, as a result “Moav became terrified.” @ITRe’m@it writes: This is puzzling, because if the word @hh<HEB>ויגר@ee<ENG> ["became terrified"] refers to the verse above, what is the meaning of “because of their great numbers” which is written immediately afterwards (v. 3)? For this implies that it was because of their numbers that they were fearful, rather than because of what they did to the two Emorite kings. One cannot answer that there is a @ITvav@it missing from @hh<HEB>כי רב הוא@ee<ENG> ["because of their great numbers"] and it as if it had stated @hh<HEB>וכי רב הוא@ee<ENG> ["@ITand@it because of their great numbers"], which would mean that it was @ITalso@it because of their great numbers; for if so, Rashi should have explained this phrase like he explained “Because Hashem took Yisroel out of Egypt.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (Shemos 18:1). The answer appears to be that the Moavites also knew that Bnei Yisroel were victorious over the two kings, however they thought that the victory had been by natural means. Thus, since their victory in war was only because of their great population, it would be possible to be victorious over them with a greater population, by engaging all the kings of Canaan against them. However, now they had heard from their king that Yisroel’s victory in war was by unnatural means, since they killed the Emorites without standing against them [to cause any casualties]. Consequently, “Moav became terrified of the people because of their great numbers,” meaning that they still had great numbers as before and had not lost a man. This was why they detested their lives. Accordingly Rashi’s explanation is as follows: “These two kings.<TIE>.<TIE>.” meaning that 'we were certain that these two kings would kill at least as many Israelites as the Israelites had killed of them, and then we would come with all the Canaanite kings to kill those Israelites who remained. However now that none of them have been killed, because no man raised his hand against them due to the fear of Yisroel that fell over them, all the more so we will not be able to [overcome them], even with [the help of] all the Canaanite kings.' @p1[3]@p2<TIE>They detested their lives.@bo Meaning that the Moavites detested their [own] lives. It is as if it had said “Moav detested their lives.” The reason for this was their fear of Bnei Yisroel. Rashi’s proof is because it is written @hh<HEB>מפני העם@ee<ENG> ["because of the people"].<QC>
@p1[4]@p2<TIE>But were they not ancient [enemies] .<TIE>.<TIE>. as it is said “who attacked<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”@bo For if it were not so, let it write @hh<HEB>הכה את מדין@ee<ENG> ["who attacked Midian"] which would imply once, however @hh<HEB>המכה את מדין@ee<ENG> implies that they were continually attacking them. @d1Why did Moav see fit to accept advice from Midian.@bo Meaning that though they had made peace between themselves due to their fear [of Yisroel], nonetheless the peace was only so that they would no longer be enemies. However, why did they see fit to accept advice? Rashi answers.<TIE>.<TIE>. @d1[Why did Moav see fit to accept advice from Midian.]@bo Since the verse associated the request for advice with Moav, and it is not written, “The elders of Moav and the elders of Midian said,” one sees that Moav accepted advice from Midian. Consequently Rashi questions “why they saw fit.<TIE>.<TIE>.” [Initially] Rashi had no difficulty with the verse, since one could say that Midian was not afraid of Bnei Yisroel, and only Moav was afraid. However now that he explains that because of their fear of Yisroel they made peace between themselves, we see that both of them were afraid. Thus there is the difficulty as to why Moav saw fit to accept advice from Midian, and why Midian did not accept advice from Moav in order to save themselves. Rashi answers, “When they saw.<TIE>.<TIE>.,” meaning that the Midianites knew [the nature of] the leader of Yisroel, meaning Moshe, because he had been raised in Midian. Therefore, Moav accepted advice from Midian. @d1Whatever an ox [laps up] is no longer marked by blessing.@bo Because it uproots everything by its roots, similarly with them, they completely uproot everything as it is written, “Leaving no survivors” (Bamidbar 21:35). For if not so, it should have said, “As the @ITanimal@it laps up.” @d1One of the chieftains.@bo Meaning: “Officers.” The text of @ITRe’m@it reads: “He was one of the chieftains of Sichon” see there. However one does not have to emend our texts because of this, since Scripture mentions him in connection with both of them, as it is written (Yehoshua 13:21) “the leaders of Midian: Evi, Rekem, Tzor, Chor and Reva, chieftains of Sichon.” [Midrash Rabbah (20:24) identifies Tzor as Balak.] @d1Like the money changer.@bo Since @hh<HEB>פתורה@ee<ENG> ["to Pesor"] has the meaning of @hh<HEB>שלחן@ee<ENG> ["table," in Aramaic. The term for a money changer (@hh<HEB>שולחני@ee<ENG>) is derived from the table at which he conducts his business]. @d1Dispatched their correspondence to him.@bo To take advice from him. @d1This was the name of the place.@bo Thus the meaning of @hh<HEB>פתורה@ee<ENG> is “to Pesor” like @hh<HEB>לפתור@ee<ENG>. For any word that should have a @ITlamed@it at the beginning [Scripture often] places a @IThei@it at the end. According to the Midrashic interpretation the @IThei@it was part of the word, given that the translation of “table” is @hh<HEB>פתורה@ee<ENG>. @d1Prophesied.<TIE>.<TIE>. “You are destined to be a king.”@bo Meaning that Bil’am prophesied about Balak, for though he was one of the chieftains of Midian, the land of his birth was Pesor. @d1Should you ask, why did the Holy One Blessed is He visit His Divine Presence.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo [One might ask why] Rashi did not wait to ask this question in its place (Bamidbar 24:2) “the spirit of Hashem was upon him”? The answer is that further on there is no difficulty, because perhaps it was in honor of Yisroel that the Divine Presence rested upon him, in order that he would bless them. However here there is a valid question. @d1For his benefit.@bo Since it is written @hh<HEB>לקרא@ee<ENG> ["to call"] why is it necessary to say @hh<HEB>לו@ee<ENG> ["to him"]? Surely afterwards it is written (v.6) “please come.<TIE>.<TIE>.” meaning that he should go with the messengers. Rather [“to him” must come] for us to expound [that the invitation was for his benefit]. Furthermore, one can say that since his intention was to [have Bil'am] curse [Yisroel], why did Balak call him to come to him? Why not have Bil'am curse them from where he was? Rather it is certain that the calling was for his benefit, and to make a money arrangement. With this we can answer the question of @ITRe’m@it who writes: I do not know from where Rashi expounds this, for there is apparent superfluous wording here as [there is] in @hh<HEB>פסל לך@ee<ENG> ["carve for yourself"] (Shemos 34:1), @hh<HEB>עשה לך@ee<ENG> ["make for yourself"] (Bamidbar 10:2) or @hh<HEB>שלח לך@ee<ENG> ["send for yourself"] (Bamidbar 13:2). But @hh<HEB>לו@ee<ENG> ["to him"] is necessary here for it is in place of @hh<HEB>אותו@ee<ENG> ["him"] as in @hh<HEB>קראן לו ויאכל לחם@ee<ENG> ["call to him and let him eat bread"] (Shemos 2:20), where the word @hh<HEB>לו@ee<ENG> is in place of @hh<HEB>אותו@ee<ENG>. @d1You may ask: Why is this harmful to you.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Why does Scripture write @hh<HEB>הנה@ee<ENG> ["behold"] twice? For @hh<HEB>הנה@ee<ENG> always implies an independent matter. With this comment Rashi answers the reason for the repetition, for now this is the beginning of an independent statement and the word @hh<HEB>הנה@ee<ENG> is required. @d1Sichon and Og.@bo (@ITKitzur Mizrochi@it) Rashi is answering the question: How could he say “they have covered the face of the earth”? Surely the [breadth] of the Israelite camp was only twelve mil? Therefore, he explains that they killed Sichon and Og whom they were relying upon. Thus the meaning of @hh<HEB>עין@ee<ENG> [translated as "face" but literally meaning "eye"] is the same as “you will be our eyes” (Bamidbar 10:31). @d1This is written incompletely.@bo Meaning that @hh<HEB>ממולי@ee<ENG> in the full spelling would mean “across from me,” however since it is written incompletely (@hh<HEB>ממלי@ee<ENG>) it is in the sense of “cutting down.” @d1My people and I.@bo Rashi is answering the question: @hh<HEB>אולי אוכל@ee<ENG> [lit. "perhaps I will be able"] is in the singular form, while @hh<HEB>נכה@ee<ENG> [lit. "we will strike"] is in the plural form. @d1To diminish them a little.@bo Meaning that this was what the Moavites were saying about Yisroel, that they would diminish them a little (Accordingly @hh<HEB>נכה@ee<ENG> is the infinitive and it means "[I will be able] to diminish"). The other interpretation is necessary because according to the first reason there is the difficulty that one had to ‘emend’ the text to read “my people and I.” Thus Rashi brings the other interpretation. However, according to the other interpretation, there is the difficulty that it should have said @hh<HEB>נכה ממנו@ee<ENG> [lit. "to diminish @ITfrom@it him"] like the language of the Mishnah @hh<HEB>מנכה מן הדמים@ee<ENG> [lit. "reduce @ITfrom@it the price"]. Thus the first reason is also necessary.<QC>
@d1All types of magic charms .<TIE>.<TIE>. another interpretation [the elders of Midian took up] this mystical omen.@bo Meaning that they took up this sign. The other interpretation is necessary, because according to the first reason there was the difficulty as to why he would need any tools for this. Furthermore he was at home and the tools of his work were certainly with him. Therefore Rashi brought the other interpretation. However according to the other interpretation there is the difficulty that @hh<HEB>קסמים@ee<ENG> is in the plural form [and means "omens"]. Furthermore, it should have said they went with this “sign” or with this “matter” in their hands. Also the term “in their hands” is not appropriate [form of language] for a sign. Therefore the first reason is also necessary. (@ITGur Aryeh@it) You might ask: Why did they use this omen? What is the reasoning behind the omen that if he did not come with them on the first occasion then he was useless? It appears to me that they applied their wisdom and chose an opportune moment, according to the mystical omens and the stars, to come to Bil’am in order [to ask him] to come with them. For there is an [opportune] time when the requester can elicit his request from the person being asked. Therefore, they said, “If he does not come with us at this time, it is useless” for if our request does not help at a time which is better according to the omens, all the more so [that it will not work] at another time. @d1But the elders of Midian departed.@bo Because they knew that he was useless. This was why Rashi above mentioned that the elders of Midian took this mystical omen in their hands, for [we see that] the elders of Moav remained with Bil’am. @p1[8]@p2<TIE>Perhaps it is beneath His dignity to allow me to go<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo You might ask: Perhaps, the meaning is like the plain understanding [that perhaps] Hashem would not want him to go with them? Similarly when it is written shortly (v. 13) “[Hashem refuses to allow me] to go with you” and Rashi explains “but with higher ranking officials,” there is also a difficulty as to what is Rashi’s source. The answer is that since it is written “Balak persisted and sent dignitaries in greater number and of higher rank than these” (v. 15) this implies that he said that it was not dignified for him to go with the first ones. [Alternatively] If “according to what Hashem tells me” means whether he commands me to curse them or not, why did the elders of Midian have depart once he said that he would do the will of Hashem? Rather it means “if He allows me go with lowly people such as you.” Consequently, the Midianites saw that there was certainly no solution here, given that he was so haughty, and as a result they departed. There is a difficulty [according to the first explanation] that Rashi should have said this there (v. 13) rather than here. It appears that Rashi inferred this from the term @hh<HEB>כאשר@ee<ENG> “according to” because it should have said @hh<HEB>אשר ידבר@ee<ENG> ["what He tells"] meaning that I will relate to you what he says. However, since it states @hh<HEB>כאשר ידבר@ee<ENG> ["according to what he tells"] it implies that Bil’am was like one who has dispute with someone and says “this will decide it, according to what He says about this matter [I shall do] whether [He says] to go or not.” Accordingly, there is a difficulty as to how one might think that he would not want go, for surely he despised Yisroel. Rather, [the question] was whether he would go with people like you. @ITR. Yaakov Triosh.@it @p1[9]@p2<TIE>He gave him the opportunity for error.@bo See above in Parshas Bereishis (Bereishis 3:9) where Rashi explains, “So as to enter into conversation with him.” Whereas here he explains that He gave him the opportunity for error. @ITRe’m@it writes, “He gave him the opportunity for error.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Meaning: He entered into conversation with him so that he would not be startled. And why was this? To give him the opportunity for error. Here Rashi explains why he entered into conversation with him but there he does not explain the reason. @p1[10]@p2<TIE>I am distinguished in the eyes of kings.@bo For if not so, why was it necessary to say “the King of Moav”? @p1[11]@p2<TIE>This is harsher than @HB<HEB>ארה לי@ee@BO<ENG>.@bo For if not so, why did Bil’am change his language? Surely Balak had said @hh<HEB>ארה לי@ee<ENG> ["curse for me"]. Therefore, this means that Bil’am despised Yisroel so much that although Balak originally requested @hh<HEB>ארה@ee<ENG> ["a regular curse"], Bil’am sought to replace it with @hh<HEB>קבה@ee<ENG> ["a harsh curse"]. @ITRe’m@it @d1As it is specific and clear.@bo Meaning that @hh<HEB>קבה@ee<ENG> is a more specific and clear term of cursing. @d1From the world.@bo Not from his land alone, for if so it should have said “From the land” like Balak’s request. @ITRe’m@it here also explains that it was due to his great hatred that he asked to banish them from the world. I myself say that he said so because perhaps Hashem would compromise with him in this matter, as I explained above. @p1[12]@p2<TIE>He said to Him “If so, I will curse them here.”@bo Rashi is answering the question: Why is @hh<HEB>לא@ee<ENG> ["@ITnot@it go.<TIE>.<TIE>.@ITnot@it curse"] written twice? Let it write simply “Do not go with them to curse the people.” Furthermore, why did Hashem say to him “for they are blessed”? This might imply [merely] that he should go and curse the people in order to annul the blessings. Rashi answers that each one is a separate statement. Since he wanted to go, Hashem said to him, “Do not go”. And because he wanted to curse them where he was, Hashem said to him, “You shall not curse.” Finally when he asked to bless them, Hashem said, “For they are blessed” and thus they do not need your blessings. (@ITKitzur Mizrochi@it) You might ask: Since it says later that [Bil'am] only had the power to curse at the moment when Hashem is angry, and that Hashem was not angry for all of those days, why did He not give him permission to go? Then, even if he had cursed them it would not have been effective. It appears to me that Hashem knew that Yisroel were destined to be smitten on account of [the service of] Pe'or. Thus if he had gone and cursed them, people would have said that they died because of the curses of this evil man. Consequently, Hashem did not give permission for him curse, since it was not his curse that caused their deaths, but rather their sin. He also did not want [Bil'am] to bless them because He had already promised the Patriarchs that He would do good to Yisroel. [Hashem did not want] people to say that it was through Bil’am’s blessings that [Yisroel] were blessed with all this good. @p1[13]@p2<TIE>We learn that he was arrogant.@bo You might ask: Perhaps @hh<HEB>עמכם@ee<ENG> ["with you"] here has the same meaning as “do not go with them” that Hashem said (v. 12)? The answer is that Rashi’s proof is [because otherwise] why was it necessary to say “with them”? Rather it should have said “Hashem refuses to allow me to go” and no more. When Hashem said, “With them” it was understandable [why this phrase was necessary]; for this meant that he should not go “according to their intentions” to curse them. But why was “with them” here necessary? @ITRe’m@it explains that Rashi’s inference is from the verse, “Balak persisted and sent dignitaries in greater number and of higher rank than these” (v. 15).<QC>
@p1[17]@p2<TIE>More than you have received in the past.@bo For if not so, how would he know how to honor him? Perhaps the entire honor that he would give him would still not come to half of the honor due to him. @p1[18]@p2<TIE>We learn that he was avaricious and he coveted the money of others.@bo Since Bil’am did not say, “If Balak would cut off my head” or do something else to me “I cannot transgress.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Rather he said “if Balak would give me silver and gold enough to fill his house.” [From here] we learn that he was avaricious.<TIE>.<TIE>. @d1And he prophesied here.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo Meaning that he prophesied but he did not know what he had prophesied. For it came forth from his mouth that he could not transgress the word of Hashem and “the word of Hashem” includes both of these matters. @ITRe’m.@it Alternatively Rashi is answering the question: Why did he say “I cannot [transgress]”? Instead he should have said “I will not transgress,” which would imply that it was dependent upon his own choice. However, “I cannot” implies that he was not permitted [to do so] since he was under the authority of Hashem. Also, since he should have said “I cannot curse them.” What is meant when he said “[I cannot transgress] the @ITword@it of Hashem”? Rather, he meant I cannot change the blessings which [the Patriarchs] received by the word of Hashem. @p1[19]@p2<TIE>In frustration.@bo [Meaning:] In disillusionment. @d1He will not alter his words from a blessing to a curse.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo Rashi is answering the [following] question: Should he not have merely said, “[What] Hashem will tell to me”? Rather this is what he was saying, “I know that He will not alter.<TIE>.<TIE>. would it be that He does not add a blessing.” @ITRe’m@it also explains here that he prophesied but did not know what he had prophesied.<QC>
@p1[21]@p2<TIE>He saddled it himself.@bo He arose before his attendants in order to act quickly and depart, rather than waiting until his attendants had saddled his donkey. This raises the difficulty that if so, why is it not written @hh<HEB>וישכם בלעם@ee<ENG> ["Bil’am arose early," as it does with Avrohom]. Rashi answers that this was to hint to the response of the Omnipresent, for Hashem said.<TIE>.<TIE>. @p1[22]@p2<TIE>He saw that the thing was evil in the Omnipresent’s eyes.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Why is it written “Hashem showed anger.<TIE>.<TIE>.”? Surely He had said to him (v. 20) “arise and go with them.” Rather, he saw that the thing was evil in the Omnipresent’s eyes because he had only allowed him to go for his own benefit, in order to take remuneration from this. But [Bil'am] craved to go in order to curse them, therefore “Hashem showed anger.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @ITRe’m@it explains that since Hashem had only agreed for him to go because of his remuneration, then he should not have gone. Therefore, “[Hashem] showed anger.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @d1He was an angel of mercy.@bo Rashi is answering the question: If he was @ITSatan@it [the angel who leads one astray] then he could not have been an “angel of Hashem” [which implies] an angel of mercy. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) It appears that Rashi inferred this from the word @hh<HEB>לו@ee<ENG> ["him"], which implies that he did not thwart anyone else. Rather, he was an angel of mercy, and inevitably here he also behaved with mercy, for Bil’am’s own good. @d1He should bring along two people.@bo For if not so, why does it say “two”? It should have merely written “accompanied by his attendants.” @d1Attend to one another.@bo Meaning: If one [of them] needs to relieve himself, the other will attend to his own duties and those of [the first]. Rashi explains so explicitly in Parshas Vayera, on the verse “He took his two attendants with him” (Bereishis 22:3). For if it was not so [and Rashi was not alluding to his comment there], one could ask: Why did Rashi not explain here like he did there concerning Avrohom? We need not ask that we had already learned this from Avrohom. For the answer is that if it had not been for this verse, one would have said that it is specifically a Torah scholar who is forbidden [to embark on a journey.<TIE>.<TIE>.] As it is taught: “A Torah scholar is forbidden to travel alone at night because of suspicion” (Berachos 43b), and Avrohom was a Torah scholar. However [one would say that] other people, even if they are distinguished, are not [forbidden from doing so]. Therefore the Torah writes this here. But if it was not for the verse there, one would have thought that this was merely proper conduct, but that there was no prohibition [to travel alone], therefore it was also necessary to write the verse regarding Avrohom. One may give another answer as to why Rashi did not explain here as he did regarding Avrohom. For concerning Avrohom it is written “Avrohom arose early in the morning” (ibid.) where the term @hh<HEB>וישכם@ee<ENG> ["arose early"] implies that it was before daybreak, meaning at nighttime before it was daylight. Thus Rashi explained that if one needed to relieve himself, he would be left alone, and it is forbidden for one to travel alone at night. This was why Rashi mentioned that a distinguished person is not permitted to travel without two attendants because of danger, and [the laws pertaining to] danger are stricter than for transgressions. But regarding Bil’am it is not written @hh<HEB>וישכם@ee<ENG> ["he arose early"], only @hh<HEB>ויקם בבוקר@ee<ENG> ["he arose in the morning"]. This implies that it was already daylight and there was no danger even if he were to remain alone. Consequently, [here] Rashi explains that this is proper conduct. (@ITGur Aryeh@it) In Parshas Vayera Rashi writes that if one [of the attendants] became distanced, then the second one would be with him. However this does not pose a difficulty. For here one could not explain that if one attendant became distanced, the second one would be with him, because even without this Bil’am would have been protected given that there were many people with him. Therefore, Rashi wrote that the reason was so they could in turn attend to one another. @p1[23]@p2<TIE>This evil one abandoned the tools of his trade.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Even without a sword the angel could still have killed him! In response he explains that the angel said “this evil one.<TIE>.<TIE>.” This is why it is written that it was @hh<HEB>שלופה@ee<ENG> ["drawn"], as if to say @hh<HEB>שלו פה@ee<ENG> ["the mouth is his"], that the mouth belongs to Yisroel who pray to Hashem, but not to you. @p1[24]@p2<TIE>Unless specified otherwise @HB<HEB>גדר@BO<ENG> refers to a barrier of stone.@bo Since below it is written (v. 25), “And pressed him against @hh<HEB>הקיר@ee<ENG> ["@ITthe@it wall"]” with a @IThei@it denoting the definite article, this implies that it was the same barrier that had been mentioned previously. @ITRe’m@it explains similarly. [We see that] a @hh<HEB>קיר@ee<ENG> ["wall"] is always made of stone because in Parshas Metzora it is written, “Behold the affliction is in the walls of the house” (Vayikra 14:37) and afterwards it is written, “Remove the stones” (v. 40) which implies that the wall was made from stone. Consequently, @hh<HEB>קיר@ee<ENG> ["wall"] here, which refers to the barrier mentioned above, was made from stones (see Bava Kamma 29a).<QC>
@p1[26]@p2<TIE>To place himself before him in a different place.@bo Rashi is answering the question: The word @hh<HEB>עבור@ee<ENG> ["passed"] is only appropriate where one crosses a river or between two objects, but here we do not find that [Bil'am] passed through anything. Therefore he explains that @hh<HEB>עבור@ee<ENG> here means “[passed] before him” as if to say that he went to another place to stand before him. The reason why Rashi stated @hh<HEB>לעבור@ee<ENG> ["to pass"] instead of @hh<HEB>עבור@ee<ENG> ["passed"] is that this is the rule of the root @hh<HEB>עבר@ee<ENG> that it comes with a @ITlamed. Re’m.@it @d1He showed him the signs of the Patriarchs.@bo It appears to me that the meaning is as follows: At the first stop he had space at either side, therefore it is written, “The donkey turned aside from the way” (v. 23) implying that it only had to turn aside a little. At the second stop it could only move to one side, as it is written, “She was pressed against the wall” (v. 25) implying that it pressed itself against that side of the wall in order for the angel to pass by. At the third stop there was no room to turn to the right or to the left, as it is written in the verse. What were the sign? That if he wanted to curse the sons of Avrohom he would find a space at either side where the curse could fall, for the sons of Yishmoel and the sons of Keturah were descended from him. And if he wanted to curse the sons of Yitzchak, he would find a space at one side, for Eisav was descended from him. And if he wanted to curse the sons of Yaakov then he would not find a blemish in them, thus he could not touch them. This is what was meant when the Torah writes at the third stop that it was “@hh<HEB>במקום צר@ee<ENG> ["in a narrow place"]” which alludes to Yaakov as it says [about him], “@hh<HEB>ויצר לו@ee<ENG> ["he was distressed"].”  @ee@BOWhich celebrates three pilgrimages a year.@bo [You might ask why] He alluded to this mitzvah and not to any other mitzvah? The answer is that regarding the pilgrimages it is written three times, “All of your males shall see” (Shemos 34:23). The Rabbis expound the word “see” to teach that just as you come to see, [so you come to be seen by Hashem] (Chagigah 2a). Thus the angel said to him, “You are coming to uproot a people from the world whom Hashem wishes to see three times [a year]. How can this take place if you obliterate them from the world?” @p1[29]@p2<TIE>This matter was extremely disparaging from him.@bo There are those who raise the difficulty: Why was this disparaging? Surely Bil’am himself said that he had no power, only that he knew how to discern the time at which Hashem is angry, as Rashi explains later on the verse (23:8) “What Divine wrath can I evoke if Hashem has not been angry.” If so why was it disparaging, given that now was not a time of anger. The answer is that Balak and the dignitaries did not know this initially, for Balak had said, “For I know that whomever you bless is blessed and whomever you curse is cursed” (v. 6). Surely [one could challenge and say that] he was only able to curse when Hashem was angry, and perhaps He would not be angry. Rather, one must say that Bil’am had not revealed this secret, and that later against his will and to his detriment the matter was revealed. @p1[30]@p2<TIE>I sent it out to pasture.@bo [@hh<HEB>ברטיבא שדאי@ee<ENG>] means, “They are grazing in the dirt” as if to say the horses are grazing in the field, but she said to him “I am your donkey.” He said, “Yes for [carrying a] burden but not for riding.” But she said to him, “That you have been riding on me.” He said, “Sometimes, on a temporary basis.” But she said to him, “All of your life until this very day, and not just this but you have also lain with me” as it says, "@hh<HEB>ההסכן הסכנתי@ee<ENG> ["was it ever my habit"]?" For concerning Avishag the Shunamite it is written (Melachim I 1:4) “to be a @hh<HEB>סוכנת@ee<ENG> ["covering"] for the king” which means to warm him [by lying with him].<QC>
@p1[32]@p2<TIE>An acronym: “She was afraid.<TIE>.<TIE>.”@bo As if to say that she turned because she saw me [and she was afraid]. @d1As if to say, “To arouse my vengeance, and to anger me.”@bo Rashi is answering the question: Since @hh<HEB>ירט@ee<ENG> is an acronym, what does “your way is against me” refer to? He answers that it refers back to "behold, I came out to obstruct you” and this is what the angel was saying: I came out to obstruct you because the way that you have followed is contrary to me, to arouse my vengeance and to anger me. With this the difficulty of @ITRe’m@it is somewhat resolved, for he writes that he does not know how to explain the word @hh<HEB>כי@ee<ENG> ["because"] here. @d1The word @HB<HEB>ירט@BO<ENG> denotes hurrying.@bo [@hh<HEB>רטט@ee<ENG>] means hurrying. @d1Because I saw that the traveler along the course hastened and hurried on the course to anger and defy me.@bo This is what the verse is saying: That "the traveler along the course", referring to Bil’am, "hurried contrary to Me", meaning to anger Me and to defy Me. Thus this is a shortened passage, because there are two nouns missing, the [name of the] traveler and the course [he was travelling]; for it would have been correct to write, “Because the traveler along the course hurried on the course that was contrary to me.” Accordingly, it is understandable why Rashi brought the simple interpretation after he brought the Midrashic interpretation, because according to the Midrashic interpretation one does not have to say that this is a shortened passage.<QC>
@d1This is a shortened passage, similar to “Dovid longed.”@bo For it was also missing [something], since @hh<HEB>ותכל@ee<ENG> ["longed"] is in the feminine form and cannot refer to Dovid. Thus it must mean “Dovid’s @ITsoul@it longed.” @d1Another interpretation @HB<HEB>ירט@BO<ENG> denotes desire.@bo The structure of the verse is as before, [but here it means] that the traveler along the course wanted to go along a course that was contrary to me. However, according to the first interpretation @hh<HEB>ירט@ee<ENG> is an expression of hurrying, while according to this interpretation it is an expression of desire. @p1[33]@p2<TIE>Like @HB<HEB>לולי@BO<ENG> “if not.”@bo Rashi is answering the question: @hh<HEB>אולי@ee<ENG> implies that perhaps she had turned aside, but here she had certainly turned aside. @d1This verse should be rearranged.@bo Rashi is answering the question: @hh<HEB>גם אותכה הרגתי@ee<ENG> [lit. "I would @ITalso@it have killed you"] implies that initially the angel had killed someone else, however this is not so. For one cannot say [that it killed] the dignitaries of Balak since they were the agents for this sin, because it is written, “Go with the men.” And one cannot say that it refers to the attendants, for what was their sin? Also, one cannot say that @hh<HEB>גם@ee<ENG> ["also"] refers to the donkey, as if to say, “As I killed the donkey, I would have killed you” for it is written, “And she, I would let live.” @d1Not only would you have been restrained.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo Meaning: Not only would I have restrained you from going, but I would also have killed you. The meaning of @hh<HEB>קראתך@ee<ENG> is “would have befallen you.”<QC>
@d1Because she spoke and admonished you, and you were unable to withstand.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo Rashi is answering the question: It is written @hh<HEB>אולי נטתה וגו'@ee<ENG> ["had she not turned aside.<TIE>.<TIE>."] meaning that “@ITif@it she had not turned aside before me as [she did] now, I would surely have killed you, and she I would let live.” This implies that now that she had turned aside, he would not let her live. But why was this so? On the contrary, now he should have had more reason to let her live since she had turned aside before him; so why would he kill her? Rashi answers that he killed her “because she spoke.<TIE>.<TIE>.” He explains the word @hh<HEB>הרגתי@ee<ENG> [lit. "I killed you"] as meaning “I would have killed you” and consequently @hh<HEB>החייתי@ee<ENG> [lit. "I let her live"] also means “I would have let her live.” We learn from here that he killed her. @p1[34]@p2<TIE>An attack against the Omnipresent.@bo Rashi is answering the question: It was certainly wicked in his eyes given that he was angry with him! An additional difficulty is why does it say “in your eyes” which implies in your eyes but not in anyone else’s eyes? A further difficulty is why it says @hh<HEB>לי@ee<ENG> (lit. [I will return] "for myself"). In response Rashi explains that it was “an attack against the Omnipresent.<TIE>.<TIE>.” and with this all the questions are answered. @p1[35]@p2<TIE>A man is lead along the path he wishes to follow.@bo For if this were not so, since Bil’am had said that he would return, the angel should have told him to return. Rather, it was because “a man [is led along] the path that he wishes.<TIE>.<TIE>.” that he told him to go. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) There is a difficulty as to why Rashi did not explain this above on the verse, “Arise and go with them” (v. 20). It is apparent that Rashi holds one cannot prove anything from the verse above, for there Hashem did not lead him along the path that he wished to follow. He wanted to curse them, while Hashem only led him on this path for his monetary benefit, having already warned him against cursing them. However here the angel said, “Because your way is contrary to Me” (v. 32), meaning even going for monetary benefit [is contrary to Me]. This caused him to retort saying, “If it is evil in your eyes to go for money, I shall return.” Even so the angel permitted him, by saying to go with the men for money. Perforce, “A man [is led along] the path that he wishes.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @d1In spite of your wishes “the word that I will speak”.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo For if not so, what did the angel gain by chasing after Bil’am in response to Hashem’s anger over him going? If it was in order to say to him, “But the word that I will speak.<TIE>.<TIE>.” surely Hashem had already told him, “However, whatever [I will say].<TIE>.<TIE>.” (v. 20) @ITRe’m.@it It appears to me that Rashi learned this from the term @hh<HEB>אפס@ee<ENG> [lit. "naught"] because it is known that the term @hh<HEB>אפס@ee<ENG> refers to the disappearance of something or some matter, as also (@ITMeir Nesiv@it) explains on the word @hh<HEB>אפס@ee<ENG>. Thus the words of the angel to Bil’am were that you can go, however the [purpose of the] journey which was in your mind is gone, because you are obliged to say “the word that I will speak.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @d1Since your portion is with them.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Why does it say “with the men”? [He answers that] it was to hint that “your portion is with them.” [One might ask the reason why] Rashi reverses the order of the verse and comments on it [so that they are] out of sequence. The answer is that Rashi [first] comes to teach that “but.<TIE>.<TIE>.” refers [back] to the word “go” so that one can learn that “a man [is lead along] the path that he wishes.<TIE>.<TIE>.” For according to the teaching, “Go with the men — since your portion.<TIE>.<TIE>.” the words “but.<TIE>.<TIE>.” would not be relevant. Also, one cannot say that it is a new subject and the beginning of a [new] statement, because why would the @ITvav@it conjunction (‘@ITand@it’@IT@it indicating a continuation of the previous topic) be necessary? Rather, one must say as explained. @p1[36]@p2<TIE>To his metropolis.@bo For if not so, why does it say “the city of Moav”? If it was to inform of the honor that they accorded him by coming out to greet him at the edge of the boundary, it should have said, “He went out to meet him at the city on the edge of the boundary.” Why does it need to say, “To the city of Moav which is on the boundary of Arnon.” In a similar fashion [the verse] regarding Kiryas Chutzos (v. 39) is expounded, as Rashi explains below; for [there too] why does it say, “And they came to@IT@it Kiryas Chutzos”? @p1[37]@p2<TIE>He prophesied that he would in the end depart from him in disgrace.@bo (@ITGur Aryeh@it) For if not so, it should say @hh<HEB>האמנם אמרת לא אוכל כבדך@ee<ENG> ["Really, do you say that I am not capable of honoring you"] but what is meant by @hh<HEB>האמנם לא אוכל כבדך@ee<ENG> [lit. "Really, I am not capable of honoring you"]. Rather this was the truth, that he would not honor him.<QC>
@p1[40]@p2<TIE>A small amount — only one of the cattle and one of the sheep.@bo [Rashi derives this] because it is written, “For I will honor you greatly” (v. 17). [This leads one to ask] why it was necessary to write “cattle and sheep”? He would certainly have honored him as promised. Furthermore, it is the general custom to send food and drink to dignitaries who come to visit, and all the more so for Bil’am and the dignitaries who were with him who came at his behest. Rather, it is written “cattle and sheep” to teach you that he did not honor him as he had promised, but rather [only] with a small amount, and he only sent him one of the cattle and one of the sheep. This teaches the wickedness of Balak, that he said much but did little.<QC>
@p1[3]@p2<TIE>He does not usually speak with me by day.@bo As it is written (Bamidbar 22:8), “Spend this night here” and similarly, “Fallen, with opened eyes” (24:4), which according to the simple interpretation means, as Onkelos translates, that Hashem only appeared at night when he slept on his bed. (@ITGur Aryeh@it) For if not so, why did he say “perhaps” which implies a doubt, while above he said “I will know what he adds.<TIE>.<TIE>.” which implies that he was certain that Hashem would speak to him? @p1[4]@p2<TIE>It denotes disgrace .<TIE>.<TIE>. as if to say “reluctantly and in humiliation.”@bo Rashi says @hh<HEB>בקושי@ee<ENG> ["reluctantly"] in the sense of @hh<HEB>מקרה ועראי@ee<ENG> ["a chance or casual occurrence"] and @hh<HEB>בזיון@ee<ENG> ["in humiliation"] in the sense of @hh<HEB>קרי@ee<ENG> ["a seminal emission"]. @d1But Avrohom only offered up a singe ram.@bo For if not so, it should say, “I offered burnt-offerings”. Why does the Torah say “an ox and a ram”? Rather it was because “Avrohom only.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1[7]@p2<TIE>With both names.@bo Though the verse only states (22:6) [that Balak told him], “Curse.<TIE>.<TIE>.” it is logical that he instructed him so, given that this was what Bil’am said. We find a similar instance in the verse, “And you said: Let us send men [.<TIE>.<TIE>.to spy out the land]” (Devarim 1:22) even though this [request] is not mentioned in the Torah. @p1[8]@p2<TIE>When they deserved to have been cursed, they were not cursed.@bo Thus the meaning of the verse is, “How can I curse when I know that Hashem will not agree to curse them through me?” And how do I know this? Because He never cursed them, even though they were deserving of a curse. One cannot say that it means that Hashem does not want to curse them, for if this were so what was meant by saying, “What Divine wrath can I evoke if Hashem has not been angry.” Surely if he had already said that Hashem did not want to curse them, even if he had been angry in those days he would not have been able to curse them. @d1But He was not angry during all those days<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo You might ask: Since he could only curse them at the moment when Hashem was angry, and Hashem was not angry during all of those days, why did Hashem tell him not to curse the people? Surely the curse would not have taken effect. The answer is that Hashem knew that they were destined to stumble with Baal Pe'or and that a plague would come upon them, thus if he has cursed them, people would have said that the plague came because of the curse. @p1[9]@p2<TIE>And powerful like the mountains .<TIE>.<TIE>. because of the Patriarchs and Matriarchs.@bo The Patriarchs are called “mountains” and the Matriarchs are called “hills.” @d1This was acquired for them by their forefathers.@bo Meaning though the word @hh<HEB>הן@ee<ENG> ["behold"] refers to the beginning of the verse, “For [I view it] from the mountain peaks.<TIE>.<TIE>.” which refers to the Forefathers as Rashi explains. Thus it comes to teach what it was that was acquired for them by their Forefathers, as rendered by Targum Onkelos, “You are destined [to live] alone.” For if not so, what is the meaning of the term @hh<HEB>הן@ee<ENG> ["behold"]? But now it means the same as @hh<HEB>הנה@ee<ENG> ["here it is"], as if to say that when I said, “It was acquired for them by their forefathers,” this was that they would dwell alone. @d1Another interpretation: When they rejoice, no nation rejoices with them.@bo According to the first reason there is the difficulty as to how one would think that He would annihilate them along with the nations, therefore Rashi brought the other interpretation. However, according to the other interpretation there is the difficulty as to how one would determine to differentiate between rejoicing and punishment, therefore he brought the first reason. @p1[10]@p2<TIE>As Targum Onkelos interprets .<TIE>.<TIE>. of the four banners.@bo Rashi explains that, “Who can count the dust.<TIE>.<TIE>.” is as Targum Onkelos interprets, and the Targum translates it as @hh<HEB>מארבע משרייתא@ee<ENG> [one] of the four camps"]. But since one might not know the meaning of this, therefore Rashi explains, “Of the four banners.” @d1Another interpretation .<TIE>.<TIE>. one cannot reckon the commandments which they perform with dust.@bo Accordingly the sequence of the verse is reversed, as if it had said: “Who can count what Yaakov does with dust,” meaning the commandments which they perform with dust. “Or count the seed of Yisroel” refers to the seed which emanates during their intercourse. Thus, it as if the verse had said “Who can count the commandments of dust that Yisroel perform, or [who can] count the seed of Yisroel’s intercourse. But I do not know how they will explain the word @hh<HEB>את@ee<ENG>. The reason why Rashi brings another interpretation is because according to the first reason there is the difficulty as to how one could not have known the count of the four banners, for surely it was possible to count them. Therefore, he brought the other interpretation where he explains that it refers to reckoning their reward [for the number of mitzvos they perform with dust]. However according to the other interpretation one has to reverse the sequence of the verse, therefore he also brought the first reason. @d1The seed<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo (@ITDivrei Dovid@it) Explains this matter according to the teaching in the chapter [entitled] @ITKol Hayad@it (Niddah 16b) that the angel who is appointed over pregnancy is called @ITLayla@it [“Night”]. He takes the drop [of seed] before Hashem and says “Creator of the Universe, what shall become of this drop? Will it be strong or weak, wise or foolish?” With this Bil’am mentioned the praise of Yisroel, that even a repulsive matter such as this was important for Hashem involve Himself with. @d1Among them.@bo Not just a regular righteous [death], for if this was his intent, the blessing would not have been directed to Yisroel. Thus, how could Balak say, “I took you to curse my enemies but you have in fact blessed them” (v. 11)?<QC>
@p1[16]@p2<TIE>What is this placing and what would Scripture have been lacking.@bo Rashi is asking two questions: Firstly, “What is this placing”? For the verse does not explain to what it refers. Furthermore, “What would Scripture have been lacking”? Meaning that it should have written, “Hashem chanced to appear to Bil’am and He stated, 'Return to Balak.<TIE>.<TIE>.'." For surely the verse would not have been lacking anything if it had not said [the phrase], “And placed the word in his mouth.” @ITRe’m@it explains: “What is this placing”? for it is impossible to say that the statement “Return to Balak” is what was meant by “and placed the word in his mouth.” For if so, why was it necessary to say “He said”? Instead it should have said, “And placed the word in his mouth: Return to Balak and say as follows.” @d1He said to him “You will be forced to return to Balak.”@bo You might ask: Why did Rashi not explain this above (v. 5)? For there also it is written “Hashem placed the word in Bil’am’s mouth and He said: Return to Balak and tell him as follows.” The answer is that above one could say that “Hashem placed in his mouth.<TIE>.<TIE>.” was in response to “I have set up the seven altars.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (v. 4). However, here the difficulty is that Bil’am had not said anything. @p1[17]@p2<TIE>This denotes derision.@bo For if not so, he should have inquired, “What do you [have to] say?” It was obvious that he had asked what Hashem had said. (@ITGur Aryeh@it) For if this were not so, why did he need to ask, given that he would certainly tell him what Hashem said, as he did at first? Rather, he intended to deride him. @p1[19]@p2<TIE>The word denotes a question.@bo As if to say, “Would Hashem say and not do [it], or speak and not fulfill it? @d1They retract then reconsider whether to change their minds.@bo Meaning that the Targum translates @hh<HEB>ויתנחם@ee<ENG> ["He should change His mind"] as @hh<HEB>תייבין ומתמלכין@ee<ENG>, which according to Rashi’s explanation means, “Who retract and then reconsider whether to change their minds.” However, according to Targum’s translation this does not denote a question; [rather] it is a statement that people are accustomed to do so, but not Hashem. @p1[20]@p2<TIE>I have received instructions from Him to bless them.@bo With this Rashi informs us that “to bless” is not a continuation of “or speak and not fulfill it” which comes before (v. 19). Rather, it is associated with the statement “what did Hashem say” (v. 17). Rashi says @hh<HEB>קבלתי@ee<ENG> ["I have received"] instead of @hh<HEB>לקחתי@ee<ENG> [lit. "I have taken"], for he had not taken [anything] from him in the normal sense. Since the word @hh<HEB>ברך@ee<ENG> is a verb root Rashi adds a @ITlamed@it because a verb root normally takes one of the letters @ITbeis,@it @ITkaf,@it @ITlamed@it or @ITmem.@it In order to indicate from whom he received the [the instructions to] bless Rashi adds the word “from Him” and to indicate whom he should bless, he added the word “them”. @d1And I will not reverse<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo With this Rashi informs us that the word @hh<HEB>ברך@ee<ENG> ["bless"] is a verb, meaning that He had blessed them, not a noun meaning that He [had a blessing and] was ready to bless them. The words @hh<HEB>ולא אשיבנה@ee<ENG> ["I cannot reverse it"] are only appropriate when referring to a noun, implying that He had not yet blessed them and I will reverse His intention to bless them. However they are not appropriate for a verb. Thus, since He had already blessed them Rashi has to say “I will not reverse His blessing” as if the Torah had stated “He has blessed them with a blessing, and I cannot reverse it.” @p1[21]@p2<TIE>The wickedness.@bo @hh<HEB>באוניות@ee<ENG> ["wickedness"] is derived from the word @hh<HEB>און@ee<ENG> ["sin"].<QC>
@p1[22]@p2<TIE>Like the power [of his] loftiness.@bo Rashi means that the word @hh<HEB>ראם@ee<ENG> is in the sense of @hh<HEB>רום@ee<ENG> ["loftiness"] not @hh<HEB>ראם@ee<ENG> ["ram"] which is an animal, for it is not proper to compare the power of Hashem to an animal. Thus the Torah is saying as follows: Just as when a builder constructs a high and mighty building, you recognize him and know that he is mighty. So too Hashem built His world and founded it upon His might. He brought them out with might, “like the power of His loftiness and elevation” meaning like the might of His world. Thus Rashi means that @hh<HEB>כתועפות@ee<ENG> ["like the power"] here and @hh<HEB>וכסף תועפות@ee<ENG> ["and silver [shall be] your strength"] both denote strength. @d1This is a great application of power.@bo Meaning that Rashi wishes to give a reason as to why the power is referred to with the term @hh<HEB>תועפות@ee<ENG>. He answers that it is from the same derivation as @hh<HEB>עוף יעופף@ee<ENG> ["let birds fly"], because the fact that a bird flies is a great application of power. For it is the manner of anything that is made up of the four elements [of matter] that when one throws it in the air, it falls to the ground. Yet a bird flies in the air, which is [apparently] the opposite of its nature, thus it is certain that it has a great strength. @d1This refers to the demons and evil spirits.@bo Meaning: Like the power of the demons which fly quickly from one end of the world to the other. According to the first reason there is the difficulty as to why the Torah had written @hh<HEB>ראם@ee<ENG> [according to that interpretation meaning ‘loftiness’] therefore Rashi brought the other interpretation because demons and evil spirits are called @hh<HEB>ראמים@ee<ENG>. However, according to the other interpretation there is the difficulty that the verse should have written @hh<HEB>ראמים@ee<ENG>, therefore he also brought the first reason. (@ITKitzur Mizrochi@it) One must explain why Rashi here mentions demons and evil spirits rather than angels. @ITGur Aryeh@it discusses this at length. But it is possible to say that it was because Bil’am’s principle acts were through demons and evil spirits, for originally he was a sorcerer. Thus since Balak was also a great sorcerer, as explained further on (Rashi to v. 28), he therefore scared Balak according to his understanding. @p1[23]@p2<TIE>To be another time such as this.@bo [Rashi knows this] because the [letter] @ITkaf@it of comparison indicates that he is comparing another time to this time. @d1For they will be seated before Him.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo Given that above it is written (v. 21), “He has the King’s friendship,” which refers to endearment and friendship, [here] he is saying that there is destined to be another time such as this, when they will be seated before him in an endearing manner. @d1Rather they are told through their prophets.@bo Meaning that @hh<HEB>כעת יאמר@ee<ENG> ["in due time it will be said"] is connected with @hh<HEB>כי לא נחש ביעקב@ee<ENG> ["for there no sorcery in Yaakov"]. According to the other interpretation the meaning of the @ITkaf,@it which indicates a comparison, is as follows: “@hh<HEB>כעת@ee<ENG>” ["In due time"] as if to say @ITif@it times arrive at which they need to speak in matters of sorcery or the occult, then “@hh<HEB>יאמר@ee<ENG>” ["@ITHe@it will say"] to them [what to do] through prophecy, and they will not need sorcery or the occult. Accordingly it is also understandable why Rashi brought two reasons. @p1[24]@p2<TIE>Until he consumes and destroys<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo @hh<HEB>אוכל@ee<ENG> ["consumes"] is also an expression of destruction. @d1And strikes them dead.@bo Referring to “and drinks the blood of its kill.” @d1Until he would strike the Midianite kings.@bo According to the first interpretation, none of the verse is understood according to its plain meaning. However, according to other interpretation there is the difficulty that it explains @hh<HEB>לא ישכב@ee<ENG> ["he will not like down", i.e., die] as referring to Moshe, while simply speaking it refers to the people. Therefore Rashi also brings the first reason. Though there is no hint from here that Bil’am would be killed with them, nonetheless it is logical that heaven showed him his death as they showed him the deaths of the Midianites.<QC>
@p1[25]@p2<TIE>The first “also” is added to the second “also.”@bo As if it had said, “Do not bless them and also do not curse them; do not curse them and also do not bless them.” You might ask: What is the reason that Balak said this to him? The answer is that Balak thought Bil’am might assume when he said, “Also do not curse them.<TIE>.<TIE>.” that if he wished he could bless them first and afterwards curse them. Therefore, he said, “Also [do not] curse them.<TIE>.<TIE>.” meaning that the first “also” refers to the second, and the second “also” refers to the first.<QC>
@p1[27]@p2<TIE>This is not a command.@bo Because how could he command him to curse them immediately, for perhaps it would not be proper in the eyes of Hashem. Therefore he said @hh<HEB>וקבותו לי@ee<ENG> ["and you will curse them for me"] in the future tense, as if to say that once it is proper in the eyes of Hashem, then you should curse them. @p1[28]@p2<TIE>It is similar with all the star gazers<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) Rashi here virtually repeats his comment above concerning the peak of the mountain (v. 14). However he adds that “it is similar with all [star] gazers.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Apparently it was understandable above that he saw there would be a breach at the peak of the mountain, since there indeed was one. For it states at the end of Parshas VeZos Habracha (Devarim 34:1), “Moshe went up.<TIE>.<TIE>. to the peak of the mountain.<TIE>.<TIE>. and Moshe died there.<TIE>.<TIE>.” However, there was no breach at the peak of Pe’or, so why did Balak take him there? And Rashi answers that nonetheless there was a breach @ITthrough@it Pe’or. Rashi thus poses the difficulty that if so, Balak was not a sorcerer, for surely he erred. He answers, “It is similar with all [star] gazers.<TIE>.<TIE>.”<QC>
@p1[1]@p2<TIE>I will mention their sins<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo The correct text is as follows: “Whether or not He wants to curse, I will mention.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Meaning, whether He wants to curse them or not, I will mention their sins. @d1As Targum Onkelos renders.@bo [Meaning:] He mentioned the sin of the [Golden] Calf they made in the desert.<QC>
@p1[2]@p2<TIE>To induce the evil eye in them.@bo For if not so, why did he raise his eyes now more than at other times? @d1It occurred to him not to curse them.@bo Rashi wishes to answer why Scripture wrote, “And the spirit of Hashem rested upon him,” which implies that [a spirit of] prophecy was upon him, but it does not specify afterwards what the prophecy was. Rather, the Torah recounts the praise of Yisroel, and he explains, “It occurred to him.<TIE>.<TIE>.” as if the Torah had stated that a different sprit was upon him, which was the spirit of Hashem that caused him not to curse. (@ITDivrei Dovid@it) In the Gemara (Bava Basra 60a) Rabbi Yochanan states: He saw that the entrances to their tents did not face each other and he said, “They are fit to have the Divine Presence rest upon them.” There Tosafos explain that one learns this because afterwards it is written, “The spirit of Hashem rested upon him.” However, this requires explanation because the Torah says, “The spirit of Hashem rested upon him” in reference to Bil’am. Rather, one must say that the explanation is as follows: There is a difficulty with the verse because it states, “He saw Yisroel encamped according to its tribes, and the spirit [of Hashem] rested upon him.” This implies prayer, [i.e.,] that he prayed for them that the Divine Presence would rest. [Consequently, we must explain that] whenever a person prays [on behalf of someone] and he needs the same thing, he is answered first. Here too, Bil’am merited that the spirit of Hashem rested upon him. This is why Rashi writes that it occurred to him not to curse them, since the spirit of Hashem had come upon him. @ITGur Aryeh@it explains why he wished to curse them that they not have Synagogues and Study Halls. Bil’am wished to remove the Divine Presence from their midst. [We find] a similar teaching regarding Study Halls: “From the day that the Temple was destroyed, Hashem only has [i.e., rests His Presence upon] four @ITamos@it of Halachah.” Bil’am’s only intention was to separate the Divine Presence from Yisroel. However, Hashem reversed this and he blessed them saying, “How goodly are your tents, Yaakov, your dwelling places, Yisroel.” Furthermore, [one may explain the blessing] based on [the verse], “The voice is the voice of Yaakov,” [whose Midrashic interpretation is]: As long as the voice is the voice of Yaakov [i.e., Yisroel are engaged in prayer and study], the hands are not the hands of Eisav [i.e., he is powerless]. @p1[3]@p2<TIE>According to Midrash Aggadah: Both of them were greater<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo [This refers to] Bil’am and Balak. Previously concerning Balak it is written (23:18), @hh<HEB>בלק בנו@ee<ENG>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@hh<HEB>צפור@ee<ENG> [lit. "Balak.<TIE>.<TIE>. his son was Tzipor"], which also meant that he was the son, and that Tzipor his father was similar to Balak. However, Rashi did not explain [that he was greater than his father] above in the comment on @hh<HEB>בנו צפור@ee<ENG>. The answer is that above one might have said that the @ITvav@it was superfluous, as with the @ITvav@it in @hh<HEB>למעינו מים@ee<ENG> ["into a spring of water"]. However here he expounds it, given that the Torah writes @hh<HEB>בנו בעור@ee<ENG> [having written @hh<HEB>בנו@ee<ENG> for] a second time, implying for it to be expounded. Subsequently, one also learns from here the meaning of @hh<HEB>בנו צפור@ee<ENG>. @d1He was a coin, son of half a coin.@bo As if to say he was a @ITlitra@it [measure], son of half a @ITlitra@it [measure]. @d1Enough for it to have been opened sealed and dried.@bo [The Mishnah] is speaking about @ITyayin nesech@it [wine handled by gentiles]. It teaches that if a barrel of wine was in the house of a gentile and remained there [for a length of time that the gentile] could make an opening in the barrel, remove some wine and then seal and wipe it, meaning that the seal would dry, as Targum Onkelos translates @hh<HEB>חרבו המים@ee<ENG> ["the water dried" (Bereishis 8:13)] as @hh<HEB>נגובו@ee<ENG> [“dried”], then it would be considered @ITyayin nesech.@it From there we see that @hh<HEB>שתום@ee<ENG> is an expression of open. @d1Some interpret @HB<HEB>שתום@ee@BO<ENG> as “of the open eye.”@bo As if to say that he had better vision than other people. @d1But did not say, “Of the open eyes.”@bo Rashi wishes to answer the question: Surely we have a tradition that Bil’am was blind, so how could he explain that Bil’am was of open eye, which implies that he had good vision? Therefore he explains that it does not say, “Of open eyes.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1[4]@p2<TIE>According to the Midrash.<TIE>.<TIE>. he did not have the strength to stand.@bo For according to the plain meaning there is the difficulty why it states “fallen,” since it should have said “lying with opened eyes.” @p1[7]@p2<TIE>Their first king.@bo [Referring to] King Sha'ul. This is what the verse is saying: “He will be greater” referring to King Sha'ul who will take the monarchy from Agag by conquering him. [@hh<HEB>וירם מאגג מלכו@ee<ENG> can also be understood as, "He will uproot the monarchy from Agag"]. @p1[8]@p2<TIE>With his power and exaltedness, shall consume.@bo The intention of this verse is not to say that the God who brought them out of Egypt has power like His [own] exaltedness and loftiness, and that with this power and exaltedness Yisroel will consume the idolaters, who are His enemy, and crush their bones. For the verse does not come to inform of Hashem’s strength; for this was already mentioned above (23:22). Furthermore, it would leave the statement, “He will consume His enemy nations” without any reference, either before or after. Therefore, the explanation of the verse is as follows: Hashem, who took them out of Egypt, has power like His [own] exaltedness and loftiness, and with this power and exaltedness, Yisroel will consume. Rashi adds the word @hh<HEB>את@ee<ENG> [which denotes the object] and the @IThei@it denoting the definite article to the word @hh<HEB>גוים@ee<ENG> ["nations"] saying @hh<HEB>את הגוים@ee<ENG> ["@ITthe@it nations"] because with this it is understood that the nations will be consumed, not that they will consume [Yisroel]. He also adds the word @hh<HEB>שהם@ee<ENG> ["who"] because with this the word @hh<HEB>צריו@ee<ENG> ["his oppressors"] is an explanation of the word @hh<HEB>גוים@ee<ENG> ["nations"]. Furthermore, he adds @hh<HEB>של צרים@ee<ENG> ["of the oppressors" to the comment “their bones”] to indicate that those who are their oppressors will be crushed, but not all of the nations. This is why it states @hh<HEB>צריו@ee<ENG> ["@IThis @itoppressors"] rather than @hh<HEB>צרים@ee<ENG> ["@ITthe@it oppressors"]. @d1Leaving the bone @bo@hh<HEB>על ערמימותו@ee@BO<ENG> ["exposed@bo"]. In the sense of @hh<HEB>ערום@ee<ENG> ["naked"]. @d1Like @HB<HEB>בעלי חצים@ee@BO<ENG> [translated as] @HB<HEB>מרי פלגותא@ee<ENG>. This is [Onkelos’s] translation of @hh<HEB>בעלי חצים@ee<ENG>, thus the verse is saying as follows: And [he shall apportion the land of] the @hh<HEB>חלוקה@ee<ENG> ["division" corresponding to @hh<HEB>פלגותא@ee<ENG> – "portion"] that came after the Flood, and from [this division] emanated all of the nations, who were [all] descended from Shes.<QC>
@p1[18]@p2<TIE>His enemies, the Bnei Yisroel.@bo Meaning that “his enemies” that is written in the verse refers to Yisroel who are the enemies of the idolaters. Rashi adds a @ITlamed@it to the word @hh<HEB>אויביו@ee<ENG> ["his enemies", thus reading "@ITto@it his enemies"] because without this, the verse is not telling to which nation Se'ir would become a possession. @p1[19]@p2<TIE>Yet another ruler shall come from Yaakov.@bo That is to say, aside from David who had been mentioned (above, v. 17). @p1[20]@p2<TIE>He gazed at Amalek’s punishment.@bo Not referring to a physical vision, for afterwards it is written, “And his end will be total destruction” meaning that the word @hh<HEB>וירא@ee<ENG> ["saw"] must refer to vision in thought. The reason why Rashi did not explain above (v. 17) that the word @hh<HEB>אראנו@ee<ENG> ["I see it"], which is a sense of gazing, refers to a vision in thought [as Rashi does here] is because the verse above speaks about the praiseworthiness and greatness of Yaakov, which is obviously a vision in thought. However here it says “Amalek was the first among nations” and one might have said that it is referring to a physical vision, therefore he explains that it refers to a vision in thought. @ITRe’m@it @d1In waging war against Yisroel.@bo Rashi wishes to answer the question: Surely there were many nations before Amalek. And one cannot explain that @hh<HEB>ראשית@ee<ENG> ["first"] is an expression of importance, for Amalek descended from the concubine of Elifaz son of Eisav. @d1Will be to perish by their hand.@bo As if to say that [their end] will not be like that of the kings of other nations, who will perish through war [with other nations]. It is because the Torah writes, “You shall obliterate the memory of Amalek” that we know that it will be through our hand. @p1[21]@p2<TIE>Tirasites, Shimasites, Sochasites.@bo Meaning that they were the members of the Sanhedrin, and all of these terms are related to the Sanhedrin. @hh<HEB>תרעתים@ee<ENG> ["Tirasites"] is an expression of a @hh<HEB>שער@ee<ENG> ["gate" because the letter @ITshin@it can sometimes be switched with the letter @ITtaf,@it and the order of letters is also switched], meaning [that they sit at] the gate of the Sanhedrin. @hh<HEB>שמעתים@ee<ENG> ["Shimasites"] is because they know the @hh<HEB>שמעתא@ee<ENG> ["teachings"]. @hh<HEB>שוכתים@ee<ENG> ["Sochasites"] is because @hh<HEB>סוכין@ee<ENG> ["they see "] with Divine Inspiration. @d1I wonder how you merited this.@bo Rashi had to explain that this was in the sense of wonder, because Bil’am came only to relate the greatness of Yisroel, so why did he relate the greatness of the sons of Yisro? For one cannot say that it was [merely] because they were encamped near to Amalek, and this was why he mentioned them after Amalek, as Rashi explains above [s.v. "He saw the Keinite"]. There is also the difficulty as to how Rashi knows that this is in the sense of wonder? The answer is that if so, [that they were only mentioned because they encamped near Amalek] why did he mention their greatness just to expound upon their deficiencies, namely that they would be exiled? [And even the mention of their deficiencies] is not demeaning, given that they have hope of returning. Rather, one must say that he only mentioned this in the sense of wonder. Another answer is that because he mentions them in the second person, saying, “How powerful is @ITyour@it dwelling place” rather than “@IThis@it dwelling place,” we see that it was in the sense of wonder. @p1[22]@p2<TIE>Perhaps to Chalach and Chavor.@bo Meaning: He will only exile you to Chalach and Chavor, and this is not considered being driven [from the world]. “To Chalach and Chavor” are names of places, and the verse is saying as follows: Even if you are destined to be uprooted along with Yisroel, [you] Kayin, what difference will this make to you, until where Ashur will take you captive? Meaning that they will only exile you to Chalach and Chavor, and this is not considered being driven from the world. @p1[23]@p2<TIE>Who is capable.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo? Meaning: Who is the person who is capable of causing Him not to put these decrees [into effect] against him? [These decrees] refers to the commingling that will come to the world. @p1[24]@p2<TIE>Similarly Doniel explains.@bo That is to say that afterwards, the nations who caused suffering to Ashur and those on the other side will ultimately be lost for eternity. @p1[1]@p2<TIE>This was its name.@bo Meaning: Although there are Midrashic interpretations explaining why it was called @hh<HEB>שטים@ee<ENG> ["Shittim"], alluding to the @hh<HEB>מעשה שטות@ee<ENG> ["foolish act "] they performed there, these Midrashic interpretations do not come close to the plain meaning of the verse. Therefore, Rashi explains that this was its name. It appears that Rashi’s inference is that since @hh<HEB>בַשיטים@ee<ENG> is written with a @ITpatach@it under the [letter] @ITbeis,@it it implies that it is a well known name. This is not so for the Midrashic interpretations. @ITR. Yaakov Triosh.@it @d1As stated in “Chelek.”@bo Meaning that there it explains the advice that Bil’am gave as to how to seduce them, even though they distance themselves from illicit relationships. As is taught there, that the younger one would sit inside and the older one outside.<TIE>.<TIE>. However he does not mean as stated in Chelek that Bil’am gave this advice. For this is evident from the verse, as Rashi explains above (24:14) that [the Torah] writes (31:16): “They were the very same ones who, on Bil’am’s advice were involved with Bnei Yisroel.” @p1[2]@p2<TIE>When he was overcome by lust.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo Rashi needed to say this, because when one is promiscuous it is because his evil inclination takes control of him. Thus one should not wonder as to how Yisroel stumbled [into promiscuity]. However one might wonder as to how they stumbled into idolatry. Therefore Rashi comes to inform you.<TIE>.<TIE>. (@ITGur Aryeh@it). For if not so, it should state, “And they prostrated themselves before the gods of Moav.” Why does it state @hh<HEB>לאלהיהן@ee<ENG> @ee["to @eetheir gods" with the word "their" in the feminine form]? This implies that their status as “gods” was connected to the promiscuity [of the women]. It was through promiscuity that they engaged in idolatry. @p1[3]@p2<TIE>Because they bared [their buttocks] before it.@bo Meaning that @hh<HEB>פעור@ee<ENG> ["Pe’or"] is an expression of opening and revealing; for they would reveal their anus and relieve themselves.<QC>
@d1He sent a plague on them.@bo As it is written shortly (v. 8), “And the plague stopped,” implying that He had sent a plague upon them. @p1[4]@p2<TIE>To pass judgment on those who worshiped Pe’or.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Though the people had sinned, what was the sin of the leaders of the people? He answers that, “And hang [them]” does not refer to the leaders of the people. Rather [it means] that they judged the people and they would hang whoever was sentenced to death. @d1All those stoned are hung.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Surely idolatry is punished by stoning, so why were they hung? @d1In full public view.@bo Since the sun is seen by all, anything that is in public view is termed as “facing the sun.” However it does not mean literally facing the sun. @d1The clouds roll back from the area above him.@bo There are those who ask: Surely when Aharon died the clouds departed, as Rashi explains above in Parshas Chukas (Bamidbar 21:1). However, we do not find that the [clouds] returned as did the well [of Miriam] which departed but then came back. @ITChizkuni@it also asks this question. It appears to me that though the clouds had departed, [nonetheless this refers to] the cloud which protected them against the wind and the heat. This was particularly [important] in the desert where the heat was intense. It also prevented the winds from blowing, for this was why they had not circumcised themselves, because the northern wind [which provides healing] did not blow. [Rashi refers to] this cloud, which had not departed from their midst. Another answer is that although the clouds had departed, this cloud [which came] was temporary, in order to reveal the identity of the sinners. @d1And the sun shines on him.@bo A thick cloud was spread over them like a succah, but for those who sinned the cloud rolled back from the area above him and the sun.<TIE>.<TIE>. @p1[6]@p2<TIE>The tribe of Shimon gathered.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo Rashi is answering the following question: Surely all of Yisroel saw that Moshe had commanded them to kill all who united themselves with Ba’al Pe’or and those who had laid with the Moavites. Thus, why was he not afraid to approach her? @ITRe’m@it explains that if he had done this on his own volition, why did he wait until Moshe said “Each of you must execute his men who were united.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (v. 5). @d1Who permitted the daughter of Yisro to you?@bo However they erred, because Moshe had married before the giving of the Torah. Alternatively she was a convert. @d1The halachah was concealed from them.@bo For if not so, why would they have wept here more than during the sin of the [Golden] Calf, or during other sins. @p1[7]@p2<TIE>And he remembered the halachah.@bo For if this were not so, why does it state, “He saw”? It should have [merely] said “Pinchas rose up from the midst of the community.<TIE>.<TIE>.”<QC>
@d1Executed by the zealous.@bo It means to say that those who wish to be zealous for Hashem are to kill him. The meaning of @hh<HEB>קנאין פוגעין בו@ee<ENG> ["executed by the zealous"] is that they must do so of their own initiative, and specifically at the time of the act. However if the one having relations separates then one cannot kill him. Also, if the zealous one comes to ask permission from Beis Din, they do not instruct him to do so, even if it is during the act. Consequently, Pinchas had to rise up of his own accord and take action. @p1[8]@p2<TIE>Many miracles were performed for him.@bo [The miracles are as follows:] Zimri should have separated [from her], in which case Pinchas would not have been permitted to kill him, however he did not separate. Zimri should have called the members of his tribe to help him. Since [he struck] through the male organ of the man and the female organ of the woman, everyone knew why he had killed them. They did not become separated by the spear. An angel came and raised the lintel [of the tent] so that he could bring them out. An angel came and caused a plague among the people in order that the tribe of Shimon would be unsettled. The blade of the spear became elongated such that it entered them and came out on the other side. Pinchas’s arm was strengthened, and the spear did not break. Their blood did not fall onto Pinchas. They did not die [immediately, which would have] made Pinchas impure. Also, [when spearing something] that which is above becomes below, and that which is below becomes above, but here what was above remained above and was below remained below.<QC>
@p1[11]@p2<TIE>Because the tribes disparaged him.@bo For if not so, surely the Torah had previously written (25:7) “Pinchas the son of @eeElozor@ee [and grand-] son of Aharon the kohein,” so why is it written [again] here. Rather, one must say that it was in order to trace his lineage. And if so, one can ask: Why does the Torah trace his lineage [again], given that it had already traced his lineage to Aharon the kohein above, at the end of Parshas Balak regarding this very action? For it is written (ibid.), “When he saw this, Pinchas the son of Elozor [and grand]son of Aharon the kohein, he rose up.<TIE>.<TIE>.”! Rashi answers that it was because the tribes disparaged him that Scripture needed to trace his lineage again, stating that he was the grandson of Aharon. Another answer as to why his lineage was traced to Aharon is as follows: Just as Aharon stopped a plague from among Yisroel when he took the firepans (Bamidbar 17:13), so too Pinchas stopped a plague from among Yisroel by killing a man from Yisroel. Therefore his lineage is traced to Aharon. Consequently, Rashi raises the difficulty that this answer is not relevant here [and answers as he does]. @d1Who murdered the chieftain of a tribe of Yisroel.@bo Meaning: There are two matters here. Firstly, he was the son of Puti meaning that the wife of Elozor was from the family of Yisro, and her father had fattened calves for idolatry, as Rashi explained above in Parshas Va’eira (Shemos 6:25). Secondly, he had murdered a chieftain of Yisroel. When Rashi states that his mother’s father fattened calves for idolatry, this was not to say that Rashi was certain that his mother’s father was descended from Yisro, rather he was being [intentionally] vague. Rashi chose one [possibility] given that he was uncertain as to whether it was his mother who descended from Yisro, or if it was his mother’s father. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it). (@ITKitzur Mizrochi@it) You might ask: By tracing his lineage [to Aharon] how did the Torah remove the grievance and the charges that they raised against him [by saying], “Have you seen that son of Puti”? For ultimately the disparagement would remain, given that his mother’s father @ITdid@it fatten calves for idolatry. The answer is that when they maligned and disparaged him for murdering a chieftain of Yisroel, this was because they suspected him of doing so out of zealousness for the honor of Moshe, his grandfather’s brother whom Zimri had challenged. Thus, the Torah comes to trace his lineage to Aharon to say that with this action he turned away [Hashem’s] anger due to his great merit, just as Aharon turned back the anger of Hashem with the incense (Bamidbar 17:13). Consequently, they should have praised him for this. Similarly in @ITPerek HaNisrafin@it (Sanhedrin 82b) [Rashi states] he was the son of Aharon [in explaining the Gemara’s statement that] he was one who turned back anger, son of one who turned back anger. [When it states that] he was the son of one who avenges, [Rashi explains] he was a son of Levi who avenged [the kidnapping of] his sister Dinah. [One could ask:] Why does the Torah trace his lineage only up to Aharon and not until Yaakov? [The answer is because] the main point of the verse is to say that in this act he was similar to Aharon, and he did this to avenge for the sake of Hashem. This attribute was in his nature, passed on from his fathers. It was not to avenge on Moshe’s behalf. @d1By avenging.@bo Rashi is answering the question: @hh<HEB>קנאה@ee<ENG> [lit. "revenge" or "raging anger"] normally refers to one who bears hatred in his heart; however Pinchas bore no hatred in his heart for Zimri. He answers, "By avenging My vengeance” meaning that @hh<HEB>קנאה@ee<ENG> is in the sense of vengeance. This leads Rashi to an additional question: How was it appropriate to write “by avenging My vengeance” in reference to Hashem? He answers, “By his avenging.<TIE>.<TIE>.” meaning that vengeance comes through rage and this was why the Torah used the term @hh<HEB>קנאה@ee<ENG>. Similarly, wherever the term “vengeance” is used in reference to Hashem, it is in the sense of rage. Rashi then has a further question: Since @hh<HEB>קנאה@ee<ENG> refers to vengeance, why did the Torah not write “by avenging My vengeance” explicitly? He answers that “@hh<HEB>קנאה@ee<ENG> always denotes.<TIE>.<TIE>.” meaning that before he enacted out his vengeance he did not decide in his heart that he was enraged to take vengeance. Thus, [we see that] the initiation of vengeance is through rage, and this was why the term @hh<HEB>קנאה@ee<ENG> was used. @d1Enflamed to avenge something.@bo @hh<HEB>המתחרה@ee<ENG> is in the sense of @hh<HEB>חרה@ee<ENG> ["burning"]. @p1[12]@p2<TIE>To be a covenant of peace for him.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Why it is written “@ITMy@it covenant”? Instead it should have written, “A covenant of peace.” He answers that [it was termed] “My covenant” because I am giving it to him to be a covenant of peace for him. Therefore, the verse did not write “a covenant of peace” so that the word “peace” would not be considered the content of the covenant [describing the covenant as one of peace], rather it is as if the verse is abbreviated, as Rashi explains [that “I give him My covenant @ITto be a covenant@it of@IT @itpeace”]. @ITRe’m@it explains that Rashi added the words, “To be a covenant of peace for him” rather than settling for the words “I give him” which were written in the verse, because afterwards it is written (v. 13), “It shall be for him .<TIE>.<TIE>. a covenant of eternal @ITkehunah.@it” There the words “give him” and “My covenant” from our verse are insufficient [meaning that the “covenant of eternal @ITkehunah@it” was in addition to the covenant already mentioned]. Thus, the same is true regarding the word “peace” and the verse means “I give him My covenant @ITto be a covenant@it of peace for him @ITand as@it a covenant of eternal @ITkehunah.@it” Rashi adds the letter @ITlamed@it to the word @hh<HEB>שלום@ee<ENG> [saying @hh<HEB>לברית שלום@ee<ENG>, lit. "@ITas@it a covenant of peace"] to show the connotation of being @ITfor@it [something], indicating that this covenant was @ITfor@it peace and @ITfor@it an eternal @ITkehunah.@it However, once Rashi had explained this regarding “peace” there was no need to do so for “eternal @ITkehunah.@it” @d1Gratitude and favor towards someone who benefitted him.@bo Meaning: He expresses favor towards him for the assistance that he provided. @ITRe’m@it writes: There is reason to be puzzled, for it is understandable according to @ITIbn Ezra@it who explains that the peace which He gave him was that he should not be fearful of Zimri’s brothers. For this is an assurance, and for which an oath [in the form of a covenant] would be appropriate, [confirming] that He would uphold His assurance. However, according to Rashi who says that He expressed his peace to him like a man who harbors gratitude, for this there is no assurance, so an oath is not appropriate and it would not say that My oath (covenant) shall be an oath (covenant) of peace for him. One can answer that the main covenant was for the eternal @ITkehunah,@it for the main Kohanim Gedolim were descended from Pinchas. And by way of this covenant, Hashem informed him that He harbored gratitude and favor towards him because of his assistance, and this was the peace [mentioned].<QC>
@p1[13]@p2<TIE>This covenant of Mine.@bo Meaning that “@hh<HEB>והיתה@ee<ENG>” ["it shall be"] is in the feminine form, and it refers to the covenant that was mentioned above, for the word “covenant” is a feminine form. @ITRe’m@it explains that the word @hh<HEB>והיתה@ee<ENG> is not associated with the words “My covenant of peace” because “My covenant of peace” would not become “a covenant of @ITkehunah.@it” Rather, it is connected with the word “My covenant” [teaching] that this covenant shall be a covenant of eternal @ITkehunah,@it just as it shall be a covenant of peace. @d1Solely to Aharon and his sons who were anointed with him.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo (@ITGur Aryeh@it) You might ask: Why was Pinchas not anointed like Aharon and his sons? The answer is that at the time he was a minor, and minors were not anointed. However once he became an adult it was no longer appropriate to anoint him [since the time for anointing had passed]. @ITKitzur Mizrochi@it answers: However, it appears more likely that because [Hashem] knew he would merit the @ITkehunah@it through his own merit, by this great act, he did not want to anoint him at that time. For then it would have appeared as if he only merited the @ITkehunah@it because he descended from Aharon.<QC>
@p1[14]@p2Where he mentions the relationship of the righteous for praise@bo@BO, he mentions the relationship of the wicked for shame.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Above where it is written, “Behold an Israelite man came.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (25:6), the Torah should have mentioned there his name. He answers that “when.<TIE>.<TIE>.” He mentions the relationship of the wicked for disparagement, because the greater one is, so too is his sin greater. @ITRe’m@it @d1Of one of the five paternal houses of the tribe of Shimon.@bo It appears that when Rashi explains, “Leader of a paternal house” as “Of one of [the five].<TIE>.<TIE>.” it refers to his comment above that Scripture also mentions the relationship of the wicked for disparagement. Meaning: You should not say that since we see that Zimri was a leader, he was a leader of the entire tribe of Shimon. Rather, he was only a leader of one of the five [paternal houses] and this was his disparagement. @d1Another interpretation: To proclaim the merit of Pinchas.@bo According to the first reason there is the difficulty that it should have only written “and the man who sinned with the Midianite woman was Zimri.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Why does the verse write, “Who was killed”? Therefore Rashi brings the other interpretation. However according to the other interpretation there is the difficulty that Scripture should have mentioned this above, therefore Rashi also brings the first reason. @p1[15]@p2<TIE>To inform you of the hatred of the Midianites, who abandoned a princess to promiscuous behavior.@bo A question is widely asked: How does Rashi know that it was because of their hatred? Perhaps they intended to cause them to sin in order that the Divine Presence would depart from Yisroel, [merely] because they feared Yisroel. The answer is that once the elders of Midian departed, thinking that Bil’am was of no use (Rashi to 22:7), why would they have acted in this manner on his advice? Rather, [we see that] they acted out of hatred. You might ask: Why did Rashi not answer, as he did above that it was, “To proclaim the merit of Pinchas.<TIE>.<TIE>.”? For here he could have also said that even though she was a princess, “He did not refrain.<TIE>.<TIE>.” The answer is that when Rashi explained, “He did not refrain.<TIE>.<TIE>.” it meant that he was not afraid that he would be punished for killing him since he was a leader, as Rashi explained.<QC>
@d1One of the five kings of Midian.@bo That is to say, that when it is written, “The national leader” this implies that Tzur was the head of [all of] them. However, afterwards it is written, “Of a paternal house” which implies that he was only the head of a paternal house. Rashi answers that he was certainly only the head of one of the five paternal houses of Midian, however he was the most prominent of all of them and this is why it is written, “The national leader.” @d1But because he debased himself by abandoning his daughter, he is counted third.@bo There are those who raise the difficulty: Why was he counted third rather than second? It would have been sufficiently degrading not to have counted him first, given that he was the national leader. The answer is that if he was counted second, one might have thought that it was not to degrade him, but it was because he was younger than all of them. Accordingly, even though he was the most prominent of all of them, he was still not counted first. However, now that he was counted third, one must say that it was to degrade him. @p1[18]@p2<TIE>In order to cause you to stray.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo Rashi is obliged to explain so because a person only antagonizes others in response to the evil that they had caused him, however we do not find that Yisroel did anything malicious to them. Therefore he explains, “Since they abandoned.<TIE>.<TIE>.” because according to their reasoning they were compelled to abandon their daughters to promiscuity in order to cause Yisroel to stray after Pe’or. @ITRe’m.@it @d1However, He did not order [the destruction] of Moav because of Rus.@bo You might ask: Why did Rashi only bring one reason, while in Parshas Matos (Bamidbar 31:2) he brought two reasons why they merited [to be saved]? The reason is that Rashi was answering the question: Here the Torah writes, “Antagonize the Midianites and kill them” (v. 17). Thus [one may ask] why was the word “antagonize” necessary given that it is written “kill [them]? Rather, one must say that it said “antagonize” because you must always treat them as enemies. This is [also] why it was said in the present tense. This raises the difficulty: Why were the Moavites not treated as enemies, at least so far as not marrying them and prohibiting the females [from converting]? Rashi answers that it was “because of Rus.<TIE>.<TIE>.” With this it is understandable why Rashi’s view is different from that of all the grammarians, who hold that [@hh<HEB>צרור@ee<ENG>, "antagonize,"] is a verb root that is used to denote a command, as @ITRe’m@it writes.<QC>
@p1[1]@p2<TIE>This is compared to a shepherd .<TIE>.<TIE>. Another interpretation: When they left.@bo Rashi is answering the question: How was the count related to the plague? [He answers] by bringing the parable. However, there is a difficulty according to the other interpretation that Rashi brings: How does this answer Rashi’s question? The answer is that previously it is written “Antagonize the Midianites and kill them.<TIE>.<TIE>.” while in Parshas Matos (31:2) it is written “Take revenge for Bnei Yisroel against the Midianites, afterward,@ee @eeyou shall be gathered to your people [i.e. die].” From there one sees that the death of Moshe was related to the war with Midian [which was itself related to the plague], and this was why the count of Yisroel was juxtaposed to the war with Midian. The other interpretation is necessary because according to the first reason there is the difficulty that he should have merely counted those who died in the plague, and then he would have automatically known how many were left. Therefore Rashi brings the second interpretation. However, according to this second interpretation there is the difficulty that in the end, the time for Moshe’s death had not yet come, therefore he also brings the first reason.<QC>
@p1[2]@p2<TIE>Their relationship follows the paternal tribe, rather than the maternal.@bo Regarding families [if both parents were from the same tribe] there is no difference between following the father or following the mother, since they were all from the same tribe, even if there were many families in [that] one tribe. However, concerning the tribes there is a difference if the mother was from another tribe [and here he wanted to determine the number of each tribe]. @p1[3]@p2<TIE>They spoke with them concerning this; that the Omnipresent had commanded to count them.@bo Rashi means to say that the word @hh<HEB>אתם@ee<ENG> ["them"] refers to the words that they spoke to Israel, in order to exclude [the alternative], so that you should not understand it like @hh<HEB>אתם@ee<ENG> ["with them", meaning] that they spoke with Bnei Yisroel.<QC>
@d1You must be counted.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo For the word “saying” does not refer to “Moshe and Elozor .<TIE>.<TIE>. spoke.” Rather, it refers to that which came afterwards, namely, “From twenty years of age and above.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Thus the verse is saying as follows: “Moshe and Elozor the kohein spoke of them,” meaning these words, “on the plains of Moav, by the Yardein near Yericho.” And what were these words that they said? “Saying from twenty years and above.<TIE>.<TIE>.” This is what they spoke to them about. @p1[4]@p2<TIE>As it is said “everyone passing by to be counted, etc.”@bo You might ask: Why does Rashi bring the verse that is stated in Parshas Ki Sisa, rather than bring the verse that is written here, as it says “count.<TIE>.<TIE>.from twenty years of age.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (v. 2)? The answer is that Rashi is answering [another] question: “As [Hashem] commanded” implies that he had already commanded them, and that Yisroel already were aware of this. However they did not know about this command until Moshe told it to them. Rashi had another difficulty: Why it is written, “Bnei Yisroel who had left Egypt”? It should have merely written “Bnei Yisroel” and no more! Thus Rashi was obliged to explain [differently] and to bring the verse stated in Ki Sisa, for that command was only said to those who left Egypt. You might ask [further]: Nonetheless, he should have brought the verse stated in Parshas Bamidbar (1:3). The answer is that the count mentioned in Parshas Bamidbar was only a temporary measure on the day that the Mishkon was erected, but it was not [to apply] for future generations. However the count mentioned in Ki Sisa was also said for future generations, for [the command], “When you count.<TIE>.<TIE>.” implies that whenever you count them, only count those from twenty years of age. @p1[5]@p2<TIE>The @HB<HEB>ה'@BO<ENG> on one side and the @HB<HEB>י'@BO<ENG> on the other.@bo You might ask: Surely regarding gentiles the Torah also writes in this manner, as it is written @hh<HEB>וירד העמלקי והכנעני@ee<ENG> ["the Amalekite and the Canaanite descended"] (Bamidbar 14:45). The answer is that if had written, “The descendants of Reuvein are: the Chanochite family” without adding “from Chanoch” there would have been no difficulty, just as [the Torah writes] regarding the Amalekite. However, now that it is written, “The descendants of Reuvein are: @eefrom Chanoch, the Chanochite family”@ee there is a difficulty as to why the Torah [also] placed the @hh<HEB>ה'@ee<ENG> on the one side and the @hh<HEB>י'@ee<ENG> on the other? @p1[9]@p2<TIE>Israel.@bo The words @hh<HEB>הצו@ee<ENG> ["incited"] and @hh<HEB>בהצותם@ee<ENG> ["when they incited"] are from the causative [@hh<HEB>הפעיל@ee<ENG>] conjugation which would refer to someone else, thus they require an object. Consequently, Rashi was obliged to explain the object of the incitement was the people. @ITRe’m@it writes: I do not know why Rashi switched the objects, and said that one was Yisroel and the other was the people. Why were they not both the same? [He answers:] Perhaps the answer is that because the verse repeats itself with different terms, the words @hh<HEB>הצו@ee<ENG> ["incited"] and @hh<HEB>בהצותם@ee<ENG> ["when they incited"]. Rashi said [that it must mean], “[Who] incited Yisroel”.<TIE>.<TIE>.“when they incited the people,” or possibly the reverse.<QC>
@p1[10]@p2<TIE>A symbol and a reminder.@bo That is to say that the term @hh<HEB>נס@ee<ENG> ["banner"] has the connotation of something high [which is visible to all], similar to @hh<HEB>כנס על הגבעה@ee<ENG> ["like a banner on top of the hill"] (Yeshayahu 30:17), and @hh<HEB>כנשוא נס הרים@ee<ENG> ["a banner raised over the mountains"] (Yeshayahu 18:3). @p1[11]@p2<TIE>They repented in their hearts.@bo Rashi wishes to answer the question: How could they not have died? For surely it is written (Bamidbar 16:32), “@ITAll@it the people belonging to Korach” meaning that his sons were also swallowed up by the earth. @d1An elevated area was secured for them in gehinom.@bo [@hh<HEB>נתבצר@ee<ENG> "secured"] is an expression of @hh<HEB>ערי מבצר@ee<ENG> ["fortified cities"] (Bamidbar 32:36). That is to say that Hashem arranged an elevated place for them, such that they would not descend too far into gehinom, and thus they did not die.<QC>
@p1[13]@p2<TIE>However the family of Ohad became extinct.@bo Rashi wishes to answer the question: Surely here the Torah only mentions those who came down to Egypt, who were counted in Parshas Vayigash (Bereishis 46:8-24). There it writes, “And the sons of Shimon were: Yemuel, Yamin, Ohad, Yachin, Tzochar and Shaul son of the Canaanite.” However, here it counts Zerach who was not counted there. Furthermore Ohad is not counted here. Rashi explains that Zerach who was counted here is Tzochar, and that “Tzochar” is [a word] meaning @IT"tzohar@it” ["illumination"]. [This is possible] because @IThei@it and @ITches@it are [sometimes] interchangeable. Also “Zerach” [is a word which] has the connotation of light. However, the family of Ohad became extinct. @d1Also Etzbon of Gad<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo You might ask: Surely Rashi himself comments later regarding Ozni (v. 16) “I say that this was the family of Etzbon”. The answer is that his explanation here is according to the teaching that seven families became extinct, however Rashi himself does not agree to this. [There is another difficulty] according to Rashi’s explanation later (v. 24) that only those who went down to Egypt are referred to as “families,” for Ozni was not one of those who went down to Egypt. Thus why was he mentioned? One cannot say that Ozni refers to Etzbon since there is no commonality between [the names] Ozni and Etzbon. Rather, one must say that when Rashi explains, “Also Etzbon of Gad” this is according to the teaching in the Yerushalmi that there were seven families missing. And Rashi also disagrees with the teaching in the Yerushalmi that only those who went down to Egypt are referred to as families. With this we can answer the inquiry of @ITRe’m@it who writes: “However there is a difficulty, for surely Rashi himself writes later that all the families were named after those who went down to Egypt, but those who were born from then on were not referred to by their own names. If this is so, how could the Torah count Ozni, for he was not one of those who came to Egypt? The matter requires investigation.” There are those who explain that, “Also Etzbon from Gad” means that one should not be surprised at the change of Zerach’s name, given that Etzbon of Gad from the tribe of Gad also had his name changed. [You might ask:] Rashi writes, “So there are seven families,” however accordingly there are only six. The answer is that when Rashi says, “So there are seven” this refers to the family of Yishvah, one of the sons of Asher. For here the Torah only counts Yishvi while in Parshas Vayigash it writes (Bereishis 46:17) “Yishvah and Yishvi.” This was what Rashi meant when he said “seven families.” @d1And from Moserah to Mount Hor there are eight journeys.@bo You might ask: Surely above in Parshas Chukas (21:4) Rashi explained that there were seven journeys. The answer is that above he was considering those from Mount Hor and onwards, not including Mount Hor. @d1Of the sons of Yitzhar, none are counted here except for the Korachite family.@bo Meaning that Yitzhar had three sons, Korach and Nefeg and Zichri, but here it only counts the Korachite family while Nefeg and Zichri became extinct. Now, since the majority of the family became extinct [it was considered as if] the entire family became extinct, and it emerges that three of the Levite families fell, the Shimites, Ezrielites and Yitzrites. @d1I do not know the identity of the fourth.@bo There are those who raise the difficulty: Perhaps the four missing families are the Shimite and Ezrielite [families], and the Nefegite and Zichrite [families] who are the sons of Yitzhar. For the Torah has only counted the Korachite family from among the sons of Yitzhar. @d1That they died in the plague at the affair of Bil’am.@bo Meaning that this specifically refers to the seven families, however one should not say that the Levites were also [killed] in the plague at the incident of Bil’am, for we do not find that the Levites sinned there. @d1As compared with the first counting at the Sinai desert.@bo For at the Sinai desert they numbered fifty-nine thousand three hundred, while here only twenty-two thousand two hundred were counted. Thus it emerges that thirty-seven thousand one hundred were missing. @d1Fell from the tribe of Shimon.@bo That is to say that the twenty-four thousand [people] who died in the plague at the affair of Bil’am, all fell from the tribe of Shimon. [This is understandable] because we find that from among the tribes, the tribe of Shimon sinned the most, for the leader of Shimon’s tribe had sinned.<QC>
@p1[16]@p2<TIE>I say that this was the family of Etzbon.@bo Meaning that Ozni who is counted here was not counted among those who came down to Egypt, therefore it appears to me that he is Etzbon, “but I do not know.<TIE>.<TIE>.” You might ask: Surely above Rashi explained, “And similarly Etzbon of Gad [became extinct]” I have already explained this above (v. 13).<QC>
@p1[24]@p2<TIE>This is Yov<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo In Parshas Vayigash (Bereishis 46:13). Rashi explains in Divrei Hayomim I (7:1) that he was [really] called Yov, but since they settled down to learn Torah, as it is written (ibid. v.12), “From the sons of Yissachar there were those who had understanding of the times” he merited to be called “Yashuv” (lit. "settled"). @d1And Ard and Na’aman, the sons of Bela, the son of Binyamin.@bo That is to say that they too were born in Egypt. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) This raises a difficulty, for if so Yaakov came down to Egypt with seventy-two souls, given that she was pregnant with them, just as Yocheved is considered part of the count of seventy souls for the same reason. One answer is that Yocheved was different because she was born at the entrance to Egypt, inside its walls, while they may have been born after being several months in Egypt. Another answer is that the tribe of Levi is different because they are counted from the age of one month. See there for more detail. @d1That their mother went down to Egypt.@bo Meaning that he gives the reason why the families of Ard and Na’aman, grandsons of Binyamin were counted, even though they were not from those who went down to Egypt.<QC>
@d1They were therefore divided into separate families<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo This is what he was saying: Do not ask how it is possible that grandchildren [of Binyamin] are considered as separate families, for the explanation is that it is like Chetzron and Chamul.<TIE>.<TIE>. @d1If this is from the Aggadah, fine, but if not<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo Meaning that if R’ Moshe Hadarshan found this reason in the Aggadah then fine, and I am not permitted to disagree with him. “But if not, then I say.<TIE>.<TIE>.” meaning that if he was saying this based on his own reasoning, then I too, am offering another reason that is my own. @d1[From Ard and Na’aman] respectively, large families emanated.@bo Meaning: Ard and Na’aman were counted as families solely because of their large numbers, given that each of them bore many children. Consequently, it was fitting for each of them to be called a family, even though they were not from those who went down to Egypt. [Rashi made this comment] because one could err, [saying] that since Ard and Na’aman were termed families due to their numerous children, their father Bela should not have been termed a family in his own right, just as Yosef was not termed a tribe in of itself, since it had already been divided into the tribes of Efraim and Menashe. [This is not a difficulty] according to R’ Moshe Hadarshan who considers a fetus like a [born] child, for accordingly a father and a child could be counted as two, like Peretz and his sons, since both were among those who went down to Egypt. However, according to Rashi’s explanation there is a difficulty. Therefore he was obliged to say that Bela had many children aside from Ard and Na’aman and they were called by his name, which was not the case for Yosef. @ITRe’m.@it @d1Five families are missing from the sons of Binyamin.@bo This explanation is also from the commentary of R’ Moshe Hadarshan, therefore Rashi brings it before the comment@ee @ee(v. 36), “These are the sons of Shuselach” [even though Binyamin is not mentioned until v. 38].<QC>
@p1[36]@p2<TIE>The other sons of Shuselach.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo This is Rashi’s own language. He wishes to explain why a family was called after a grandchild [of one of the tribes] as explained above.<QC>
@p1[39]@p2<TIE>Being humbled among the nations.@bo @hh<HEB>שפוף@ee<ENG> ["humble"] has the connotation of hovering [just above the ground].<QC>
@p1[53]@p2<TIE>Even if they reached twenty before the apportioning of the land.@bo Meaning [the verse implies that] you shall apportion the land “among these” 601,730 mentioned above who came to the land of Israel, in accordance with the view of Rabbi Yonasan (Bava Basra 117a). However, [there is a difficulty that] the verse did not need to mention this, given that we would know it from [the verse], “The land shall be apportioned as an inheritance according to the number of names” which comes afterwards, teaching that the land was apportioned to those mentioned above. Thus, what does the Torah mean to teach [by saying] “among these” which implies an exclusion, [i.e.] among these, but not among others. [Rashi answers:] The exclusion is that [the division] was specifically “among these” who were twenty years of age and above, but not others [even if they reached twenty before the apportioning of the land]. @ITRe’m.@it @p1[54]@p2<TIE>They gave a larger portion.@bo Although it was distributed [to the people] in equal portions, nonetheless the land was divided into twelve unequal areas. [This was possible because] the division was miraculous, the lots of each member of the tribe joining together in order to facilitate this. Similarly, it was miraculous in that the lot denoting a large portion of the land did not come out for a tribe with a small population. (See @ITMizrochi@it and Gemara Bava Basra).<QC>
@p1[55]@p2<TIE>Scripture deviates with this inheritance.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo Rashi wishes to answer the question: Surely above it is written (v. 53), “The land shall be apportioned among these” which implied those who are entering the land of Israel. But here it implies [that it was divided among] those who left Egypt. @d1But here the dead inherit the living.@bo It appears that the reason is because anything good that emanates from the mouth of Hashem is not retracted. Here Hashem had promised to give the land of Israel to those who left Egypt, but they all died in the desert. Therefore, Hashem commanded that the inheritance should be returned to those who left Egypt and that they would bequeath it to their children. With this we may also answer [the difficulty with] what was stated in Parshas Va’eira (Shemos 6:8), “I shall give it to you as a bequeathal @hh<HEB>מורשה@ee<ENG>” but the Torah did not write “I shall give it to you as an inheritance @hh<HEB>ירושה@ee<ENG>.” Rather, [we see] it was a hint that they would not enter and inherit the land of Israel; only they would bequeath it to their children after them. @d1Had sons who entered the land.@bo Meaning: They had sons of twenty years of age who were thus fit to inherit.<QC>
@d1To their grandfather, and they then shared everything equally.@bo Meaning to the father of the two brothers who had already died; from here one sees that the dead “inherit” the living. Subsequently they would divide it equally among the two brothers, since it was [considered] the bequeathal of their father, and afterwards the single son would inherit the same amount as the three. Rashi says “to their grandfather” rather than “to their father” because if their inheritance only reverted to their fathers, who were from twenty years of age and above when they left Egypt, why would it be divided equally when each of those who came to the land of Israel returned it to his father. Surely each one would bequeath it back to his children, and not to his brothers’ children. (See Gemara Bava Basra and @ITMizrochi@it). @d1This excludes Yehoshua and Kalev.@bo Meaning that @hh<HEB>אך@ee<ENG> ["only"] comes to exclude [something], implying that it was not divided by lottery. Yet surely the Torah writes, “By word of the lottery” (v. 56). Rather, “This excludes Yehoshua and Kalev.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Rashi reverses the order here, first commenting on “By word of the lottery.” [The reason] appears to be that one might have said “Only by lot” was merely to indicate that everything was done miraculously, as he explains concerning “By word of the lottery.” However, after Rashi had explained concerning “By word of the lottery” that it was “By Divine Inspiration,” there is a difficulty as to what is meant by “only.” Consequently, he explains that “This excludes Yehoshua and Kalev.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @ITR. Yaakov Triosh.@it @p1[56]@p2<TIE>The lots spoke<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo For if not so, why does it say, “By word of the lottery”? Surely the Torah had written, “Only by lot shall [the land] be divided.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (v. 55). Rather, it was to teach that it was through Divine Inspiration, meaning that at the moment when the lots came out a voice would emanate with the lot saying, “I am the lot of the area of Acco, and I have come up for such and such a tribe.” Rashi needed to say this, otherwise [one may ask]: Given that they divided [the land] according to the largeness or smallness of the tribe, why then was it divided by lots? Perhaps a tribe with a large population would draw a small portion. Consequently, he explains that the lottery was by Divine Inspiration.<QC>
@p1[59]@p2<TIE>Her birth was in Egypt.@bo Meaning, the verse is abbreviated and does not explain who bore her, thus one must say that his wife bore her. Then there is the difficulty as to why does it say “in Egypt”? So Rashi was obliged to explain that her birth was in Egypt, but not her conception. This would only have been possible if she was born between the walls [upon entering Egypt].<QC>
@p1[62]@p2<TIE>To have been counted from the age of twenty.@bo Rashi wishes to answer the question: It is written, “They were not counted among Bnei Yisroel.” Yet they were counted! He answers that they were not counted from the age of twenty years like Yisroel, rather from the age of one. @d1Since no inheritance was given to them.@bo @ITRe’m@it writes: The matter requires investigation. Surely above in Parshas Bamidbar (1:49) it is written “However, the tribe of Levi [you shall not count].<TIE>.<TIE>.” and there Rashi gives two reasons: One is that “The King’s Legion is worthy [of being counted separately],” and another is that “The Holy One, Blessed Is He, foresaw with His Holy Spirit that a decree would arise [against all those who were counted].<TIE>.<TIE>.” [However, we may ask] what is Rashi’s source for those two reasons? Surely here the Torah writes the reason why they were not counted among Bnei Yisroel. Perhaps the answer is that the reason given by the Torah is to explain why they were counted from the age of one month and above and not from the age of twenty years and above, as it is written, “From one month and older; they were not counted among Bnei Yisroel” [meaning that they were not counted] from age of twenty and older. However, the reason said by the Rabbis was to explain why they were not counted among Bnei Yisroel, rather than why each one was counted separately. Accordingly, the verse [in Bamidbar] was necessary to instruct one not to count the tribe of Levi among the tribes of Yisroel. However I do not know how it would be possible to count them together, since one was [counted] from the age of one month and older, and the other from the age of twenty years and older. Thus the matter requires investigation. It appears to me that the Rabbis were answering the question: The count of Bnei Yisroel was not in the order of birth [of the progenitors of each tribe], rather in order of their banners. Therefore, the Torah should have counted the tribe of Levi after [counting the tribes under] the [first] two banners to travel. So why were they counted separately? For this Rashi gives two reasons.<QC>
@p1[64]@p2<TIE>However, against the women.@bo Rashi wishes to answer the question: Why did the Torah write “[no] man”? It should have said “no one was left.” @d1While the women said “give us possession.”@bo Meaning: They were also among those who cherished the land. They said [the daughters of Tzelofchad], “Give us a possession among our father’s brothers” (27:4).<QC>
@p1[1]@p2<TIE>To teach you that they were all righteous.@bo That is to say this is another reason why it said “Menashe the son of Yosef.” (@ITKitzur Mizrochi@it) [Rashi states that they were all righteous] even though regarding Tzelofchad it states (v. 3), “But he died because of his own sin” and the Rabbis disagree as to what was the sin. The answer is that he only had this sin and since he died on account of it, his death was his atonement. Thus he was counted among the righteous. You might ask: Surely it is written “Korach son of Yitzhar, son of Kehos”; and Korach was known to have been wicked, yet the righteous were mentioned along with him. The answer is that the Torah would say this only regarding a person who's actions, and the actions of his forefathers were clearly known, like Korach who was known to have been wicked. Thus regarding Yitzhar, Kehos and Levi who were [clearly] righteous, it would have been impossible to change that which was known.<QC>
@p1[2]@p2<TIE>But rearrange the passage.@bo And it is as if it had said, “They stood before Elozor the kohein” and afterwards [it said], “Before Moshe.”<QC>
@p1[3]@p2<TIE>He died by his sin alone.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo For if not so, what difference is it if he died because of his sin? @d1He was the wood gatherer.@bo Here it says, “Our father died @ITin the wilderness@it” and there it states “Bnei Yisroel were @ITin the wilderness@it and they found him.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (Bamidbar 15:32). Therefore [we can learn a @ITgezeirah shavah@it] — just as there it referred to the wood gatherer, so too here it refers to the wood gatherer. @d1Among those who ascended defiantly.@bo As it is written in Parshas Shelach @hh<HEB>ויעפילו לעלות@ee<ENG> ["they defiantly went up"] (Bamidbar 14:11) where @hh<HEB>ויעפילו@ee<ENG> has the numerical value [of 212 which is equivalent] to @hh<HEB>צלפחד@ee<ENG> ["Tzelofchad"]. Because the Torah hid this, without revealing [his identity,] Rabbi Shimon said that he was among those who ascended defiantly, but not that he was so wicked as to have profaned Shabbos. @p1[4]@p2<TIE>But if he had a son<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo Rashi wishes to answer the question: The word @hh<HEB>כי@ee<ENG> ["because"] always denotes a reason for that which precedes it. However, how is this giving a reason for that which came before? On the contrary, it was because he did not have a son that [his name was] omitted. Thus Rashi explains that they were saying as follows: Why should it be omitted? Give us the inheritance because he did not have a son. “But if he had [a son].<TIE>.<TIE>.” @d1That they were learned.@bo Maharan raises a difficulty: In @ITPerek Yesh Nochalin@it (Bava Basra 119b) it says that when they said, “Because he did not have a son” this teaches that they were demanding. And when they said, “We are in place of a son” this teaches that they were learned. The matter requires investigation. @p1[5]@p2<TIE>The @BIhalachah@BO was concealed from him.@bo For if not so, later in Parshas Masei it merely writes, “Moshe instructed [Bnei Yisroel] according to command of Hashem, [saying]: ‘Correctly are the descendants of Yosef’s tribe speaking’” (Bamidbar 36:5), but here he had to bring their case before Hashem. Rather, [the @IThalachah@it] “was concealed.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @d1Another interpretation: It was fitting [for this chapter]<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo According to the first reason there is the difficulty as to how [do we know that] the @IThalachah@it was concealed from him? Perhaps Moshe did not want to rule on the @IThalachah@it without Hashem’s instruction, as is written above in Parshas Beha'aloscha concerning “There were men.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (Bamidbar 9:6). There Rashi did not explain, “Here he was punished,” so the same should hold true here. Therefore Rashi brings the other interpretation. However, according to the other interpretation there is the difficulty as to why here it is not written, “Stand and I will listen.<TIE>.<TIE>.” as it does there (v. 8). Therefore Rashi also brings the first reason.<QC>
@p1[7]@p2<TIE>As Targum renders @HB<HEB>יאות@BO<ENG> [as] “correctly.”@bo Meaning that Rashi wishes to explain the word @hh<HEB>יאות@ee<ENG> used by the Targum; that it means that the daughters of Tzelofchad had made a correct claim. For this is how the Rabbis expound the verse [teaching]: “Tzelofchad’s daughters speak correctly” because thus is this chapter inscribed before Me. @ITRe’m.@it It appears that Rashi is answering the question: Why is it not written “they speak @hh<HEB>צדק@ee<ENG> ["justly"]" or “[they speak] @hh<HEB>משפט@ee<ENG> ["lawfully"]”? Because the term @hh<HEB>כן@ee<ENG> ["correctly"] has the connotation of @hh<HEB>כמו כן@ee<ENG> ["similarly" implying a reference to something] written and explained elsewhere. Therefore, Rashi brings the words of the Rabbis that thus is this chapter inscribed before Me. However, since this matter is not explicitly mentioned in the verse, Rashi therefore brings the Targum who uses the word @hh<HEB>יאות@ee<ENG>. @ITR. Yaakov Triosh.@it @d1Two portions.@bo @ITRe’m@it expands here, but his conclusion is that Rashi used the terminology of the @ITberaysa@it (Bava Basra 116b). Even though the @ITberaysa@it is according to the opinion that the land was divided among those who left Egypt, Rashi did not [use it] because he holds like this. Rather, from there one can learn that according to the opinion that [it was divided among] those who came to the land. @hh<HEB>נתן תתן@ee<ENG> ["give, you shall give"] refers to two portions in the property of Cheifer, which were considered “returned” [to him]. For the portions taken by the sons of Cheifer who were from among those who came to the land, were all “returned” to Cheifer who was one of those who left Egypt, as it is written “according to the names of their fathers’ tribes should they inherit it” (26:55). Thus it would emerge that it is as if Cheifer had [posthumously] received all of these portions and then bequeathed them to each of his sons. Tzelofchad would inherit two portions because he was the firstborn, while the other brothers would each get one portion. Consequently, the daughters of Tzelofchad would receive the two portions of their father from the property of Cheifer, and regarding these two portions the verse wrote, “Give, you shall give.” Rashi uses the language, “The portion of their father.<TIE>.<TIE>. and his portion with his brothers in the property of Cheifer” like the language of the @ITberaysa.@it His intention was merely to say that they had the two portions of their father among his brothers in the property of Cheifer. However [this raises a difficulty:] His daughters could not have taken anything from @eeCheifer@ee himself, since the land was divided among those who came there, not those who left Egypt. Furthermore, it would not be appropriate to consider anything [as] returned to him, because he did not have any sons who entered the land such that they would return to him the portions that they took there. @ITRe’m@it concludes that the matter requires investigation. @d1Denotes anger.@bo Meaning that Hashem has fury and anger against him, therefore He does not leave a son to inherit him. @d1Only on that generation.@bo Meaning: One should not raise the difficulty that in Parshas Masei it is written (Bamidbar 36:9), “No inheritance will be transferred [from one tribe to another].<TIE>.<TIE>.” teaching that a woman from one tribe is not permitted to marry a man from another tribe. Rashi [there] explains that this command was only for that generation, but not for subsequent generations. [Both interpretations brought by Rashi are necessary:] According to the first reason there is the difficulty that it should have been punctuated as @hh<HEB>והעברת@ee<ENG> with a @ITsegol,@it given that it was in the sense of anger, therefore Rashi brings the other interpretation. However, according to the other interpretation there is the difficulty as to why it is written the term “transfer” regarding the daughters of Tzelofchad, for they were permitted to marry only their cousins. Therefore he also brings the first reason. @p1[11]@p2<TIE>Nothing constitutes family except from the father’s side.@bo (@ITDivrei Dovid@it) Though Scripture often writes “According to their families, their paternal house,” nonetheless, here concerning inheritance where a daughter is considered like a son when he has no son, males and females are inevitably equated. Thus, one might have said that the mother’s [family] was also termed “family” in this matter, so Rashi informs us [that this is not so].<QC>
@p1[12]@p2<TIE>Why is this placed here.@bo Meaning that Mount Avarim is Mount Nevo, and when Moshe went up to Mount Nevo he did not come down. [Rather] he died there immediately, as is written in Parshas Vezos Haberachah (Devarim 32:49). Thus, “Why was this placed here.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @d1Another interpretation: When Moshe entered.@bo According to the first reason there is the difficulty as to why he rejoiced, perhaps when it is written “give them,” it means through your command, as it is written in Parshas Masei (Bamidbar 34:13), therefore Rashi brings the other interpretation. However, according to the other interpretation there is the difficulty as to why this [section] was placed here, therefore Rashi also brings the first reason. @d1The chamber.@bo @hh<HEB>לקיטון@ee<ENG> means “to the chamber.” Similarly @hh<HEB>ויבא החדרה@ee<ENG> ["and he came to the chamber"] (Bereishis 43:30) is rendered by Targum Yonasan as @hh<HEB>ועל לקיטונא@ee<ENG>.<QC>
@p1[13]@p2<TIE>From here we derive that Moshe yearned.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo [Rashi knows this] because it is not written, “As Avraham was gathered” or as any one of the other righteous people [were gathered]. @d1Another interpretation: You are no better than he.@bo That is to say, that just as he died because of this sin, so too will you die. [One might ask why] Rashi brings the other interpretation here? He does not [mention it] later in Parshas Haazinu (Devarim 32:50) where he only explains “that he yearned.” Similarly, [why he did not bring it] above in Parshas Chukas (Bamidbar 20:26)? It appears that usually the Torah writes, “As was gathered .<TIE>.<TIE>. @hh<HEB>על אשר מריתם@ee<ENG> ["because you disobeyed"]" but here it writes, “As was gathered .<TIE>.<TIE>. @hh<HEB>כאשר מריתם@ee<ENG> [lit. "like you (pl.) disobeyed"]” which implies that the reason why he would be gathered in like Aharon was because he sinned like him. Therefore Rashi also explains the other interpretation that “You are no better than he.” @ITR. Yaakov Triosh.@it @d1Your time would not yet have arrived<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo You might ask: Surely in this Parshah it is not written @hh<HEB>על אשר לא קדשתם@ee<ENG> ["because you did not sanctify"]. The answer is that according to the other interpretation where Rashi explained that "You are no better than he” it implies that just as Aharon died though his time had not yet arrived, so too Moshe would die even though his time had not yet arrived. However, where do we find that he died before his time? Rashi answers that regarding the death of Moshe it is written, “Because you did not sanctify.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (Devarim 32:51). The other interpretation is necessary because according to the first reason there is the difficulty that Moshe’s death was not like that of Aharon, for in his lifetime Aharon saw that his position of leadership had been passed to his children, however this was not so regarding Moshe, therefore Rashi brings the other interpretation. But, according to other interpretation there is the difficulty that that the phrase @hh<HEB>כאשר מת אהרן@ee<ENG> ["just as Aharon died"] implies that Aharon died before his time had come, but this is not explicitly said regarding Aharon. Therefore, the first reason is also necessary. (@ITGur Aryeh@it) Though it is stated in the first Perek of Rosh Hashanah (11a): “I am one hundred and twenty years of age today” (Devarim 31:2), why does the Torah say “today”? Rather, [it means]: “Today I am completing my days and my years” teaching that Hashem sits and completes the years of the righteous, from day to day and from month to month. The answer is that it is certainly true that he completed his [natural] years, however he should have lived [longer] due to his righteousness, since the fear of Hashem adds to one's years. However, now that he had sinned he was left with this natural lifespan and nothing was added. @d1One for degenerate behavior.@bo She was adulterous, [but did so] without warning. @d1The other for eating unripe Shmittah produce.@bo Meaning Shmittah produce that had not yet ripened completely, for the Torah writes, “To eat” (Vayikra 25:6). [From here we derive] "But not to squander" (Pesachim 52b). The one who ate the Shmittah produce requested from the court that they publicize why she was being punished, so that people would not say that she too was [punished for] degenerate behavior; here too.<TIE>.<TIE>. @p1[14]@p2<TIE>They had no other sins.@bo That is to say, that they had only the sin of the waters of dispute, but no other sin. Accordingly, this refers to Moshe and Aharon. @d1The rebellion at Marah.@bo Meaning that those who rebelled at Marah with the waters of dispute were “the same as those who rebelled.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Accordingly this refers to Yisroel. The other interpretation is necessary because according to the first interpretation there is the difficulty that it had already said that they had no other sin, therefore Rashi also brings the second interpretation that it refers to Yisroel. However, according to this second interpretation there is the difficulty as to why it is necessary to mention here the sin of Yisroel, therefore the first reason is needed.<QC>
@p1[15]@p2<TIE>To make the virtue of the righteous known.@bo Meaning, why did Moshe say this rather than praying that he would enter? @d1Answer me<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo For if not so, why is it written, “Saying”? It is understandable regarding, “Hashem spoke .<TIE>.<TIE>. saying” for this has already been explained as meaning “Go and say overpowering words to them” or “Go and say my words to them, and bring back [word], as to whether they will accept them” as it is written, “Moshe brought back the word of the people to Hashem” (Shemos 19:8). However, here these two explanations are not feasible. Therefore Rashi explains: “Answer me.<TIE>.<TIE>.” See also Parshas Vaeschanan (Devarim 3:23). @p1[16]@p2<TIE>He said, “The time has come for me to ask.”@bo It appears that Rashi is answering the question: According to the Rabbis who explain “saying” as meaning Moshe said to Him, “Answer me.<TIE>.<TIE>.” would the generation be without a leader? Rather, his question was whether it was necessary to appoint a leader, or whether his children would inherit his position of leadership, as it says, “Give Tzelofchad’s inheritance to his daughters.” This was why the Rabbis expound so, and therefore Rashi also followed the words of the Rabbis. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) It appears that this contradicts Rashi’s comment above that they [i.e., the leaders] ignore their own needs and concern themselves with the needs of the community, yet here he says that the time had come to ask for his personal needs! However in truth there is no difficulty, because by way of concerning himself with the needs of the community, to appoint a leader for them, he also concerned himself with the needs of his sons. [He asked] that they would be the leaders. Hashem answered him, “He who keeps watch over the fig tree.<TIE>.<TIE>.”<QC>
@d1As he never moved.@bo Meaning that he sat in his tent and studied Torah. @d1Why was this said.@bo Rather than saying “God of the heavens” or “God of the earth.”<QC>
@p1[17]@p2<TIE>Another interpretation [of “and bring them in”]: That You will not treat him in the way You treat me.@bo According to the first reason there is the difficulty as to why it states, “And who will lead them out” for what merit is needed for leading out? It is understandable that to bring them in requires merit that they not perish, [but regarding leading them out there is a difficulty]. Therefore Rashi brings the other interpretation. And according to the second interpretation there is the difficulty that, “Who would lead them out” is not the same as, “Who will go forth before them.” There, his main prayer was for the people, while, “Who would lead them out” is explained as his prayer for the benefit of the leader. Since the @ITvav@it conjunctive in @hh<HEB>ואשר יוציאם@ee<ENG> ["@ITand @itwho would lead them out"] implies that his prayers were [@ITalso@it] entirely for the benefit of Yisroel, Rashi also brings the first reason. @p1[18]@p2<TIE>Take him with words of persuasion.@bo Rashi has already explained on numerous occasions that the term @hh<HEB>קיחה@ee<ENG> ["taking"] is inappropriate for people, therefore he explains.<TIE>.<TIE>. @d1Someone scrutinized by yourself.@bo Although the manner of Scripture is to use the word @hh<HEB>לך@ee<ENG> ["yourself"] without any need, such as in @hh<HEB>עלה לך היערה@ee<ENG> ["ascend to the forest"] (Yehoshua 17:15) and other similar instances, nonetheless wherever we can expound, we expound. @ITRe’m@it: It appears to me that Rashi is answering the [following] question: Since Moshe’s request was that his sons would inherit his position, as Rashi explained above, it should not have said @hh<HEB>לך@ee<ENG> ["yourself"] which implies that his initial request was for Yehoshua, since this was not the case. He answers, “Someone scrutinized by you.<TIE>.<TIE>.”<QC>
@d1As you requested.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo Meaning that above you asked saying “The thought of every individual is known before You.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (Rashi v. 16), thus I shall do so, and I will choose Yehoshua whom you know and in whom there is a spirit, as you requested.<TIE>.<TIE>. @d1Provide a public announcer for him.@bo For it is written afterwards (v. 20), “So that the entire community of Bnei Yisroel will hear.” But what would they hear? Rather [this means] to provide a public announcer. @d1That he might preach in your lifetime.@bo One must say that the laying of hands of a Rabbi upon his student is related to his being given permission to instruct and give rulings [whether] to forbid or to permit [an issue]. Therefore here, concerning Yehoshua, if the laying of hand was [to take effect] after Moshe’s death, why did he do it? After his death there would be no need for [Yehoshua to receive] permission. Rather [permission was given] during the lifetime of Moshe. You cannot say that perhaps the laying of hands was the bestowing of radiance, for if this were so it should have juxtaposed the statement of bestowing your radiance (v. 20) to the words, “And lay your hand.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Rather, one must say that “Lay your hand” is another matter and it is the giving of permission.<QC>
@p1[20]@p2<TIE>The face of Moshe was like the sun.@bo Meaning: The face of Moshe shone more than that of Yehoshua. There are those who explain that like the sun takes its light from Hashem and the moon takes light from the sun, so too Moshe took the rays of light [which shone from] his face from Hashem, and Yehoshua took them from Moshe. @d1That they will treat him with reverence.@bo Meaning: So that they will hear about the radiance that you gave him, and consequently they will treat him with reverence. However, one cannot explain that “will hear” means “will accept” because if so, the word @hh<HEB>אליו@ee<ENG> ["to him"] would be missing, because accordingly the meaning would be, “So that all of Yisroel will accept his words and his decrees.”<QC>
@p1[21]@p2<TIE>Here is [the reply] to your request.@bo That is to say, how was this matter relevant here, for what relevance did Elozor have to [the appointment of] Yehoshua? (@ITGur Aryeh@it) For if not so, why did He command Moshe, He should have commanded Yehoshua directly. @d1The Sanhedrin.@bo [Rashi knows this] because right before [in this verse] it is written, “And all Yisroel with him.” Why then is it necessary to say “And the entire community”? Rather, this refers to the Sanhedrin. @p1[22]@p2<TIE>He persuaded him verbally.@bo Rashi is answering the question: It is already written, “Moshe did as Hashem commanded him,” so why is it necessary to say, “He took Yehoshua”? Rashi answers that “He persuaded him.<TIE>.<TIE>.” meaning that he said more to him than Hashem had said. For Hashem only commanded him to say, “You are fortunate that you have merited this.<TIE>.<TIE>.” However Moshe informed him “of the reward.<TIE>.<TIE>.” The reason was so that he would not say, “Of what benefit is this aggravation to me?” given that Moshe and Aharon had been punished because of the people. He therefore informs him of the reward. @p1[23]@p2<TIE>Generously.@bo Here also there is also the difficulty as to why was it necessary to write [that he laid his hands] as I explained above (v. 22). @p1[2]@p2<TIE>May Hashem command<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo Rashi is answering the question: What connection does the passage of the constant burnt-offering have with the passage above, where it states “May Hashem, God of the spirits command”? @d1Before you command Me concerning My children, command My children concerning Me.@bo As it is written, “May Hashem command.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (27:16). [This means first] command My children concerning Me, that they should serve Me [by teaching them the laws of My altar offerings].<QC>
@d1This refers to the blood.@bo As is written (Vayikra 1:5), “The sons of Aharon shall bring the blood” upon it. @d1This refers to the “@BIemurin@BO” parts.@bo Meaning that @hh<HEB>והקטירם@ee<ENG> ["shall burn them"] refers to the @ITemurin@it parts that are burned. There (Vayikra 3:16) it is written “bread” [referring to the @ITemurin@it parts]. Thus we see that the @ITemurin@it parts are referred to as “bread.” @d1They learned from here and instituted the @BIma’amados@BO units.@bo Meaning that it is written, “You shall be vigilant.” This implies that for the entire duration of the offering, in the morning and in the afternoon, all of Yisroel should stand over it. However, this is impossible because everyone has to concern himself with his own affairs to support himself. Therefore, they instituted [the @ITma’amados@it] and divided all of Yisroel into twenty-four groups, and similarly the Leviim and the Kohanim were divided into twenty-four groups. One of those twenty-four groups of Kohanim would serve, and similarly they instituted that one group of Leviim and Yisraelim would stand over the constant burnt-offering for one week. During the next week a different @ITma’amad@it [would take their place] and they would be considered as the emissaries of all of Yisroel, for the emissary of a person is considered like the person who sends him. The cycle would continue in this way, such that no one @ITma’amad@it served more than twice a year. @d1Every day<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo For surely it was offered twice daily, thus why was it necessary to say, “At its prescribed time”? Rather, it was so that it would not be withheld, even in a state of impurity. [You might ask:] Why does Rashi not explain here that “at its prescribed time” means even in a state of impurity, as he explains concerning the @ITPesach@it offering (Bamidbar 9:2)? The answer is that there the @ITPesach@it offering came only once a year, thus the term “At its prescribed time” would imply even in a state of impurity. However here the constant burnt-offering was offered twice daily, thus “At its prescribed time” was only appropriate according to Rashi’s explanation. @ITRe’m@it @p1[3]@p2<TIE>This is an admonishment to the Beis Din.@bo Meaning, an admonishment to Beis Din, that they should warn Yisroel regarding the constant burnt-offering. For if not so, why repeat, “Say to them”? @d1Like the plain interpretation.@bo Meaning: Two each day; one in the morning and one in the evening. @d1That they should be slaughtered towards the sun.@bo For if not so, why is it necessary to say “two each day”? Since it says, “You shall offer the one lamb in the morning” (v. 4) why did the Torah say, “Two each day”? Rather it means @hh<HEB>כנגד היום@ee<ENG> [lit. "opposite the day"] which means opposite the sun. @d1To the east of the rings.@bo Meaning: [They should be slaughtered] near the rings which were in the east, in order to be opposite the sun so that no one would say that they were serving the sun. The rings mentioned here are the rings that Yochanan the Kohein Gadol established in the area of the courtyard used for slaughtering. They were inserted into the ground and the legs of the animals were fastened to them during the slaughter.<TIE>.<TIE>. @p1[4]@p2<TIE>Here the commandment is for all the generations.@bo (@ITKitzur Mizrochi@it) Ramban claims that this is not correct, for there it already stated, “A continual burned-offering for your generations.” Chizkuni answers that the minimum [meaning of the] number of “generations” is two and no more, therefore the verse where it is written “command” (v. 2) implies alacrity for now and for future generations is necessary. @p1[5]@p2<TIE>The libation @BIminchah.@bo Meaning that this was the tenth of an @ITeiphah@it of fine flour which comes with the offering, to the exclusion of the meal-offerings mentioned in Vayikra, which come on their own (Vayikra 2). @p1[6]@p2<TIE>Like those which were done during the days of inauguration.@bo Meaning that when the Torah wrote, @hh<HEB>העשויה בהר סיני@ee<ENG> [lit. "that was offered at Mount Sinai"] it implied that these had already been offered at Mount Sinai. So why then was it necessary to offer it here? Rashi answers that it was “@ITlike@it those.<TIE>.<TIE>.” meaning that he ‘amends’ the verse as if it had said @hh<HEB>כהעשויה@ee<ENG> ["@ITas@it was done"] with a [letter] @ITkaf@it indicating comparison. @p1[7]@p2<TIE>Wine.@bo Meaning [wine] but not other drinks, for in the passage dealing with the libations it is written “@ITwine@it for a libation, one fourth of a @IThin@it” (Bamidbar 15:5). @d1They shall be poured on the altar.@bo Although it is written, “In the Holy” alone without explaining where, it means upon the altar which is termed "holy," as is taught in Succah 49a. @p1[10]@p2<TIE>But not one Shabbos burnt-offering.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo You might ask: Why concerning Yom Tov does Rashi also not write that we do not bring the burnt-offerings of one Yom Tov on another Yom Tov? The answer is that this does not have to be taught, for it is obviously forbidden, given that each Yom Tov has a distinct name. However, each Shabbos is the same as another Shabbos and one might have said that this was permitted, thus Rashi informs us that it is forbidden. (@ITGur Aryeh@it) One cannot say that this only comes to exclude the burnt-offerings of Shabbos from being offered on Yom Kippur, for example the @ITemurin@it of Shabbos that were left over until Yom Kippur, teaching that they should not be offered. However one could make up for the burnt-offerings of one Shabbos on another Shabbos. For if so, it should have written @hh<HEB>עולת שבת בשבת@ee<ENG> [lit. "the burnt-offering of Shabbos on Shabbos"]. What is meant by @hh<HEB>בשבתו@ee<ENG> ["on @ITits@it Shabbos"]? Hear from this that the verse is saying [it shall be brought] on @ITits@it Shabbos and not on another. @d1Between the two constant-offerings.@bo When it is written @hh<HEB>על עולת התמיד@ee<ENG>[lit. "upon the constant burnt-offering"] this implies [that it was offered] after the constant burnt-offering. However, since it did not write @hh<HEB>על עולת התמידים@ee<ENG> ["upon the constant burnt-@ITofferings@it"] it implies that it was offered between the two constant-offerings. With this the difficulty of @ITRe’m@it is answered. However according to Rashi’s comment, “Aside from the two constant burnt-offering lambs” which explains the word @hh<HEB> @hhעל@ee<ENG>as meaning “aside from” I do not know how one can derive from here that they may only be offered between the two constant-offerings.<QC>
@p1[12]@p2<TIE>Designated as such in the chapter of the libations.@bo Meaning: Parshas Shelach Lecha (Bamidbar 15:9).<QC>
@p1[15]@p2<TIE>All the [musaf] goats<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo Meaning, why do they bring a he-goat on the New Moon as a sin-offering — for what sin [was it brought]? @d1The ritual defilement of the Sanctuary.@bo Meaning: If one entered the Sanctuary in a state of impurity; “And its sacred objects,” meaning: If one brought an offering in a state of impurity. @d1Who was not cognizant either at the beginning or the end.@bo Such as a proselyte who converted, or a baby who was kidnapped by gentiles. @d1The other goats are derived from this one.@bo Meaning: One learns [this quality] of the festival musaf goat-offerings from the goat brought on the New Moon. For it is written, “@ITAnd@it [one] goat,” with a [letter] @ITvav@it denoting something in addition to the musaf of the New Moon. [This teaches that] just as the musaf of the New Moon atones for the defilement of the Sanctuary and its sacred objects, so too the other goats. Those [goat-offerings] that do not have a [letter] @ITvav@it [preceding them] are learned from those cases where the Torah did teach this law, since we learn the general case from the explicit. @d1This is also expounded aggadically<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo Even though the first explanation is also a Midrash. But, the meaning is as follows: It is expounded @ITaccording@it to the aggadah, meaning with an aggadic explanation. For the first midrashic interpretation was according to the @ITberaysos@it of @ITToras Kohanim@it which contain @IThalachos@it and monetary laws. @d1This entire offering.@bo (@ITGur Aryeh@it) Meaning: This does not refer to the goat at all, since there are no libations for a sin-offering. Rather, it refers to the [entire] offering.<QC>
@d1 “Its libation” does not [only] refer to the goat.@bo Why would this be written concerning the goat and not the bulls, rams and sheep? Furthermore [Rashi comments:] “Its libation” does not refer to the goat, meaning that it only refers to the continuous burnt-offering mentioned previously, as if the Torah had said, “In addition to the continuous burnt-offering and its libation shall you make this offering.” @p1[18]@p2<TIE>For example, to prevent a loss.@bo (@ITGur Aryeh@it) Meaning: The Torah writes a prohibition concerning “work of consequence” in order for one to expound that on the intermediate days only work of consequence is permitted, [meaning work] that prevents a loss from happening. For if it had only written, “Any work,” then the authorization of allowing to do work that the Torah writes concerning the intermediate days would have also referred to “any work.” However now that the prohibition regarding work to prevent a loss from happening is written regarding the festival, we inevitably learn that the authorization of allowing to do work on the intermediate days is specifically for work to prevent a loss from happening, but not for other types of work. (@ITKitzur Mizrochi@it) explains that this was necessary to inform us that other types of work are prohibited on the festival; for one would have said that since work was permitted [on the festival] regarding the preparation of food, so too it was permitted [to do work] to prevent a loss from happening, [i.e.] where there would be a monetary loss if it were not performed on that day. Thus, we are informed that even in this case it is forbidden.<QC>
@p1[26]@p2<TIE>Which are the first of the wheat @BIminchah@BO-<FJ> offerings.@bo Though the omer allows all varieties of new crop, wheat, barley and other types of grain, this is concerning for food that is eaten. However, for offerings one would not be permitted to bring from the new crop until after the @ITminchah@it of the two loaves which was brought from the wheat from the present year.<QC>
@p1[31]@p2<TIE>The Rabbis derive from this.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo Meaning: Above (v. 30) the Torah should have said, “One he-goat to make atonement for you, @ITshall be without blemish for you.@it” However, it was juxtaposed to the libations to teach you that the libations too, should be without blemish.<QC>
@p1[11]@p2<TIE>And aside from the constant burnt-<FJ> offering you shall offer.@bo Meaning: [The words] “[And] the constant burnt-offering” are not referring to “the he-goat as a sin-offering,” rather to “You shall bring a burnt-offering” above (v. 8). Thus the verse reads: “One  he-goat as a sinoffering aside from the atonement sin-offering, and the atonement burnt-offering aside from the constant burnt-offering and its meal-offering.” Consequently, it is as if it is written “aside from” twice, for the [letter] @ITvav@it of @hh<HEB>ועולת@ee<ENG> ["@ITand@it the [constant] burnt-offering"] refers to “aside from” [of] the atonement sin-offering. @d1This relates to the  musaf-offerings.@bo You cannot say that it refers to the constant burnt-offering, for if so it should have said @hh<HEB>ונסכה@ee<ENG> ["and @ITits@it libation"] in the singular, as it writes @hh<HEB>ומנחתה@ee<ENG> ["and @ITits@it meal-offering"]. Furthermore, you cannot say that it refers to “one he-goat as a sin-offering” because sin-offerings do not have libations. Thus, one must say that it refers to the musaf burnt-offerings. Rashi states: “This relates to the musaf-offerings stated above, and to “you shall offer,” even though it is not written, “You shall offer” in this verse. Nonetheless, since Rashi previously commented on, “And the constant burnt-offering” explaining: “Aside from the constant burnt-<FJ> offering you shall offer these burnt-offerings,” means that it was as if the verse had explicitly written, “You shall offer.” Consequently, “And their libations” refers to them. @d1It denotes a command.@bo Rashi holds that the Torah is now commanding to bring the libations of the musaf burnt-offerings, for it had not yet written about any libations concerning these burnt-offerings.<QC>
@p1[35]@p2<TIE>Restraint from doing work.@bo Thus, when it is written afterwards, “You shall not do any work of substance” this is an additional explanation, [meaning] that the verse itself explains what you shall restrain yourselves from. @d1Another interpretation of restraint, restrain yourselves from leaving.@bo For according to the first reason there is a difficulty that the verse itself explains what the restraint was, [stating] that it was the performance of work. Therefore Rashi brings the other interpretation. However, according to the second interpretation there is a difficulty that since it refers to Yisroel, why is it written, “It shall be a day of restraint for you”? It should have merely said, “You shall restrain yourselves.” Therefore Rashi also brings the first reason. @d1According to the Aggadic Midrash.@bo [Rashi says this] even though the first reason was also from a Midrash. This is because the first Midrash was in accordance with the @ITberaysos@it in @ITToras Kohanim,@it which are comprised of @IThalachos@it and monetary laws, however this [Midrash] is Aggadic.<QC>
@p1[36]@p2<TIE>Represent Yisroel.@bo Who are singular on the earth. @d1Proper conduct<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo Meaning: It refers to the bulls of the festival above. From their progressive diminishing [in number] we learn proper conduct.<TIE>.<TIE>. @p1[39]@p2<TIE>As obligations.@bo Rashi wishes to answer the question: It is written, “These you shall make to Hashem on your festivals, aside from your vows.<TIE>.<TIE>.” However, since you also must make the vows and dedications, why did it not group them together? He answers that “these” which was written at the beginning [of the verse] refer to those things designated as obligations, aside from the dedications which are optional. @p1[1]@p2<TIE>Because up until this point we have the words of the Omnipresent.@bo Rashi is answering the question: It is obvious that he said [over] all that Hashem had commanded him! Furthermore, in the entire Torah it mentions the command alone, so why here does it mention the command and also Moshe’s words to Yisroel? He answers that “because.<TIE>.<TIE>.”<QC>
@p1[2]@p2<TIE>By teaching them first.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Why is it written, “To the tribal leaders”? One cannot say this passage was only said to the tribal leaders, and not to all of Israel. For here it states, “This is the word” in order to learn a @ITgezeirah shavah@it [scriptural comparison] as Rashi explains shortly, to teach that this passage was said to all of Israel. If so, why is it written, “To the tribal leaders”? Rashi answers that it is to “bestow honor.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Accordingly the meaning of “To the tribal leaders @ITof@it Bnei Yisroel” is “[To the tribal leaders] @ITand to@it Bnei Yisroel.” @ITRe’m.@it We cannot say that perhaps the verse means “To the tribal leaders of Bnei Yisroel” because if so, why would it have been necessary to write “of Bnei Yisroel” given that it would have been sufficient to just say “To the tribal leaders, saying.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Rather, one must say that it was informing us of the order of teaching, as @ITRe’m@it explained and as Rashi will explain shortly. Alternatively, Rashi is answering another question: Why did the verse write @hh<HEB>ראשי המטות לבני ישראל@ee<ENG> [lit. "to the tribal leaders, @ITto@it Bnei Yisroel"] when it should have said @hh<HEB>אל ראשי מטות בני ישראל@ee<ENG> ["to the tribal leaders @ITof@it Bnei Yisroel"]? Rather, since the verse was written in this way one must say that “tribal leaders” is considered a construct, meaning that the word “tribal” is a construct with the word “leaders.” Consequently the word “Yisroel” is distinct, not a construct with the word “tribal,” rather it is an independent word. Thus one is obliged to explain as follows: Initially Moshe said this to the tribal leaders and afterwards to Bnei Yisroel, and it is as if it had written “and to Bnei Yisroel.” This was the honor bestowed upon them, that he taught them first and afterwards the Bnei Yisroel. Accordingly it is also understandable why the Torah did not write, “Hashem spoke to Moshe saying: Speak to Bnei Yisroel: If a man makes [a vow].<TIE>.<TIE>.” Rather the verse must be coming to inform us of the order of teaching, writing “Moshe spoke” as if to say, “This was [the order] of Moshe’s speech to Yisroel.” This is the essence of Rashi’s explanation according to @ITToras Kohanim,@it however in Gemara Nedarim (78a) it is expounded differently. @d1Why, then, did he see fit to say this here?@bo Meaning that because throughout the entire Torah honor had been bestowed upon the leaders, as it is written, “They returned to him, Aharon [and all the leaders.<TIE>.<TIE>.].” Why was this taught again here? @d1Vows may be annulled by a single expert.@bo When the Sage comes to permit a vow, he removes it retroactively as if there had never been a vow. With this sanction, the vow is annulled as if there had never been one; therefore Rashi uses the term @hh<HEB>הפרה@ee<ENG> ["annulment"]. @d1By three laymen.@bo [Rashi says this] because “Tribal leaders” implies that there was one leader who could annul the vow, namely the one expert. You might ask: Surely it is written “leaders” in the plural form? The answer is that it speaks of leaders in general, referring to all the tribal leaders. Now, since one expert was required, then three laymen would be needed. [We derive the number as follows:] It is logical that we would need more laymen than experts. However, it is not possible [that we require only] two, given that a court can never be evenly balanced. Thus, we add an additional one, totaling three. We need not ask that perhaps more than three, because if so there would be no end to the matter. @d1Only to the leaders.@bo And accordingly, @hh<HEB>לבני ישראל@ee<ENG> ["of Bnei Yisroel"] would mean @ITfor@it Bnei Yisroel, meaning that he taught the leaders so that they would teach Yisroel, but Moshe did not teach everyone for that would not be necessary here. [One might have thought so] since the annulment of vows requires people appointed over Yisroel, in order to instruct them as to which vows one is unable to annul and which one is able to annul. Therefore, here it would have been sufficient to have the leaders instruct them. Thus, Rashi answers that “here it says.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @d1Moshe prophesied.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo You might ask: “This is the word” was necessary for the @ITgezeirah shavah@it [scriptural comparison] above, as Rashi explained. The answer is that here one cannot question the gezeirah shavah, therefore it does not need to be superfluous [and one can also expound the simple meaning]. @d1With the phrase “this is the word.”@bo This is an additional distinction, for “This is the word” implies that it is the word itself, which was clearly heard from Hashem in what is termed a “clear vision.” This was not so for the other prophets, as Hashem spoke to them only in riddles or through dreams, termed as “unclear visions.” But to Moshe He spoke “the word” itself, so that he could tell it to Bnei Yisroel. Likewise, it states (Bamidbar 12:8), “Mouth to mouth I speak to him, in vision and not in riddles.” [One might ask what was meant] when Moshe prophesied with the words “So says Hashem” as it is written in Parshas Va’eira (Shemos 8:26) and in Parshas Bo (Shemos 10:3). The answer is that before he stood on Mount Sinai he would prophesize with “So [says Hashem]” however after the Torah was given he prophesied with “@ITThis@it is the word [of Hashem],” once his face began to emit beams of light. @d1Another interpretation: “This is the word” is exclusionary.@bo According to the first explanation, there is the difficulty of why it did not say this for all of the mitzvos. Therefore Rashi explains that “this is the word.<TIE>.<TIE>.” However, one cannot say that it was only said for this [second] reason, for if so why did the Torah say, “The word that Hashem commanded.<TIE>.<TIE>.”? It should have said explicitly what is excluded. Therefore, the first reason is also necessary. @d1The Sage with the term “release” and the husband with the term “nullification.”@bo The Sage only releases [the vow] when there is regret, therefore the term “release” is suitable. However the husband nullifies without regret and without providing any reason, thus the term “nullification” is appropriate. @d1Following the Scriptural language here.@bo For it is written (v. 3) “If a man makes a vow.<TIE>.<TIE>.to initiate a prohibition himself, @IThe@it may not profane his word” which implies that he may not profane his word, however another [i.e., Sage] may "profane" it for him. Furthermore, it is written @hh<HEB>לאסור איסר@ee<ENG> ["to initiate a prohibition"] which implies that he prohibited a certain article upon himself and another person can come and release him from the prohibition. It is regarding “prohibition” the term “release” is appropriate, for @hh<HEB>איסור@ee<ENG> ["prohibition"] has the connotation of a knot, making the term @hh<HEB>מתיר@ee<ENG> [lit. "untying, releasing"] appropriate — just as one unties a knot. Hear from this that the term @hh<HEB>התרה@ee<ENG> ["release"] refers to the Sage. @p1[3]@p2<TIE>A @BIkonam@BO that I will not eat.@bo Meaning that he says, “Let this article be @ITlike@it a @ITkonam@it to me, that I will not eat.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Though [a statement] prohibiting one from eating is applicable to a @hh<HEB>שבועה@ee<ENG> ["oath"] rather than a @hh<HEB>נדר@ee<ENG> ["vow"], as @ITRamban@it asks, this has already been answered by @ITRe’m.@it See there.<QC>
@d1Like @HB<HEB>לא יחלל@ee<ENG>. Thus, it is one of the doubled roots and had it not been a [a letter] @ITches,@it which does not take a @ITdagesh@it [dot], it would have had a @ITdagesh@it in order to complete the doubling. [Here the root is doubled, thus it should have been @hh<HEB>חלחל@ee<ENG>. However a @ITdagesh@it in the @ITches@it would have substituted for the second letter @ITches@it]. [@hh<HEB>לא יחלל@ee<ENG>] means, “He should not belittle his words” as one belittles unsanctified property without concern of guarding it from impurity, as [one guards only] sanctified property from impurity. @p1[4]@p2<TIE>Under her father’s jurisdiction.@bo At the end of this passage it is written, “In her youth, while in her father’s house” (v. 17) which is apparently superfluous, given that here it is written, “In her father’s home while still in her youth.” Rather, it comes to teach you that all the profits of a youth belong to her father, and this is even if she is not in his house, since “In her father’s house” is not to be taken literally. Similarly, here, “In her father’s home” means under his jurisdiction and not literally in his house. @ITRe’m.@it @d1But not a minor.@bo Meaning that her vows are not definite vows, rather there are those whose vows must be examined, and there are those that are not vows at all, as explained.<QC>
@p1[6]@p2<TIE>I would not know what this @HB<HEB>הנאה@BO<ENG> means.@bo You might ask: Surely without that verse Rashi would still know the meaning of @hh<HEB>הנאה@ee<ENG>,@ee for afterwards he brings the verses @hh<HEB>למה תניאון@ee<ENG> ["why do you turn away"] and @hh<HEB>אל יניא ראשי@ee<ENG> ["not turn my head"]. [@ITRe’m@it] brings many more difficulties. The answer is as follows: Initially Rashi explained “He restrained her from the vow” in accordance with his later explanation that “Its plain meaning is [to restrain.<TIE>.<TIE>.].” However, since it said, “If he restrained her” I might have said that he could annul the vow solely with words, by saying, “I do not wish this vow to stand.” Therefore Rashi explained that “In other words, he nullified it.” Meaning as the @ITSifri@it teaches, that he has to explicitly nullify the vow saying, “Let it be nullified for you.” But if he did not say so and merely restrained her, then it is not annulled. It is in relation to the @ITSifri@it that Rashi says, “I would not know what this @hh<HEB>הנאה@ee<ENG> means,” meaning that according to @ITSifri@it “If her father @hh<HEB>הנאה@ee<ENG> ["restrained"] her” is in the sense of nullification, and I would not know how @hh<HEB>הנאה@ee<ENG> implies nullification. However, since the @ITSifri@it explained that at the end of the passage it says regarding the husband, “But if on the day her husband hears about it, he restrains her and then annuls” (v. 9) we see that @hh<HEB>הנאה@ee<ENG> in the context of the husband is nullification. Thus it would be logical to say that @hh<HEB>הנאה@ee<ENG> here in the context of the father is also nullification. For if it merely meant restraint, the verses would be contradictory, for “Her father restrained her” would imply mere restraint while “restrain” in the context of the husband would imply nullification, that he said, “Let it be nullified for you,” because it is written, “If.<TIE>.<TIE>. he restrains her and nullifies.” Therefore, one must say that “nullify” is the explanation of “restrain” and we see that @hh<HEB>הנאה@ee<ENG> written in the context of the father is also nullification, only that [here] the Torah wrote @hh<HEB>הנאה@ee<ENG> in place of nullification. Nonetheless, its plain meaning is to restrain and turn aside as Rashi explains above, bringing proof from Scripture. Afterwards (s.v. ‘will forgive her’) Rashi raises a difficulty: Since “Her father restrained” implies actual nullification, why is it written, “Hashem will forgive her”? Why would she need forgiveness if she did not sin, given that her vow had been annulled? He answers that regarding the husband it also writes, “Hashem will forgive her” (v. 9) and, “To whom does Scripture refer? To a woman who made a [Nazirite] vow.<TIE>.<TIE>.” This is a woman who needs forgiveness, even though the vow was annulled. So too, regarding the father and daughter, it refers to a daughter who made a Nazirite vow where her father heard.<TIE>.<TIE>. She too needs forgiveness, since she was not aware that it was nullified, and transgressed her vow, as Rashi explains. He expands more upon this, see there. (@ITKitzur Mizrochi@it). Regarding Rashi’s comment about the youth, that if she took a Nazirite vow and he nullified it etc., @ITMahari@it raises the difficulty that there is no punishment in the heavenly court until the age of twenty. He answers that this could be where she vowed not to eat meat for twenty years, meaning her vow continued until after she had reached twenty, and became independent. If she then transgressed her vow, she would require atonement. He discusses this at length but finally he raises the difficulty with his answer that it is inconceivable that she would not hear or know about the nullification until the age of twenty. It appears to me that the matter is not dependent upon any punishment, for even an older woman would not be punished, given that her husband had annulled the vow. However, there would still be some blemish to her soul. Here too with the youth, since she knew to whom she made the vow [in the case where she was a minor], and all the more so if she was older than twelve where she would be liable to punishment in the earthly court, her soul would be somewhat blemished because her intention was to sin. @p1[7]@p2<TIE>But perhaps to a “@BInesuah@BO.”@bo Meaning that although the plain understanding of @hh<HEB>הויה@ee<ENG> [lit. "being" having the connotation of marriage] refers to @ITkiddushin@it [betrothal], nonetheless, we also find @hh<HEB>הויה@ee<ENG> referring to relations as in “his virgin [sister] who is close to him, who was not @hh<HEB>היתה@ee<ENG> ["married"] to a man” (Vayikra 21:3) where [@hh<HEB>היתה@ee<ENG>] refers to relations, meaning she was a @ITnesuah.@it Thus, I would have said that @hh<HEB>הויה@ee<ENG> here also refers to relations and a she was a @ITnesuah,@it such that both the father and the husband would annul her vow. However “when it says.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @d1So this must mean an “@BIarusah@BO.”@bo For here it is written @hh<HEB>ואם היו תהיה לאיש@ee<ENG> ["if she is married to a man"] which is in the sense of @hh<HEB>הויה@ee<ENG> ["marriage"] and @ITkiddushin.@it @d1That her father and husband annul her vow.@bo Meaning that the Torah did not group them [the @ITnesuah@it and @ITarusah@it] together so that it could distinguish between them, teaching about an @ITarusah@it that her father and husband annul her vow, which is not the case for a @ITnesuah.@it Afterwards Rashi explains that one should not say that [between] her father and her husband one of them can annul it, for this is not so, because “if the father annulled.<TIE>.<TIE>.” as is explained in the continuation of the passage. @d1If one of them endorsed it.@bo We have said that if one annulled and one was silent then it is not annulled. Even more so if one endorsed, the other would not be able to annul.<QC>
@d1But her father did not hear them — they were neither annulled.@bo Because if the father annulled [the vows], they would not have to be annulled any further. @d1Nor endorsed.@bo Because if the father endorsed [the vows], the husband’s annulment would not help. [In the case of an @ITarusah@it] if the father did not annul while the husband did, it would not help, as Rashi explained above that “[if the father] annulled but not [the husband].<TIE>.<TIE>.” Consequently, even more so if the father endorsed the vows, they could not be annulled by the husband’s annulment. @p1[9]@p2<TIE>Perhaps even if the father did not annul<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) There is no doubt that [the title of this comment, as it appeared in the text of the Sifsei Chachamim] is a copyist’s error, for that verse (v. 13) refers back to “If she took the vow in her husband’s home” (v. 11) and the case where she was married. However, the text of @ITRe’m@it is correct, for [its heading] reads, “He then annuls her vow.” @d1All through her youth she is under her father’s jurisdiction.@bo Rashi means to say that above when it is written (v. 7) @hh<HEB>ואם היו תהיה לאיש@ee<ENG> ["@ITand@it if she is married to a man"], it should have written @hh<HEB>אם תהיה@ee<ENG> ["if she is married to a man"]. However, the [letter] @ITvav@it links it to the previous subject where it is written (v. 6), “Her father restrained her.<TIE>.<TIE>.” [i.e. where the father annulled her vow]. Consequently, when we expound that "all the profits of a youth belong to her father" from the verse, “In her youth, while in her father’s home” (v. 17) this also implies that here she would require the annulment of her father. Thus, there is no difference between an @ITarusah@it and an unmarried girl, for the [conjunctive letter] @ITvav@it links it to the previous subject where she was also under the jurisdiction of the father, and would refer to an @ITarusah@it who is under the jurisdiction of both [the husband and the father]. @ITRe’m@it explains that if it had referred specifically to an unmarried girl, but that the jurisdiction of the father had been removed from an @ITarusah,@it why is it necessary to say “In her youth, while in her father’s house” (v. 17) a second time? Surely it had already written “In her father’s home, in her youth” (v. 4). Both of these explanations are in the Gemara, as @ITRe’m@it also mentions. Thus, the verse, “If she is married” refers to a woman who imposed a prohibition [on herself] in her father’s home during her youth, where her vow was still upon her since her father had not heard about it. Subsequently, if after she became betrothed her father heard about it, he would also be party to its nullification. @p1[10]@p2<TIE>A widow after @BInisuin.@bo The explanation is as follows: A widow is not under the jurisdiction of the father and a divorcee is not under the jurisdiction of the husband regarding the nullification [of vows]. You might ask: Why would one think that he could annul [the vow]? The answer is that once we find that the husband can annul a vow even if it was not made under his jurisdiction, such as where she made a vow in her father’s house, [one would have said] all the more so that he could annul [this vow] for her, since she made it under his jurisdiction. Therefore, Rashi explains that she is not under the jurisdiction of the husband. @p1[11]@p2<TIE>Scripture refers to a @BInesuah.@bo (@ITGur Aryeh@it) The reason why the Torah did not place “But if she took a vow in her husband’s home” before the verse, “The vow of a widow” (v. 10) which speaks about a case after marriage, is because the Torah was not being specific when it said, “Widow or a divorced woman.” For the same holds true for an adult who is unmarried, [since] the father does not have jurisdiction over her, her vow stands like that of a widow. Thus the verses are in order, for first it speaks of a youth who is under the jurisdiction of her father entirely, and afterwards, “And if she was married to a man” where she is under the jurisdiction of her father and her husband. Then [it refers to] a woman who is not under the jurisdiction of the father [i.e.] a widow or a divorced woman, with the same being true for an adult. Next, [it refers to] a @ITnesuah@it who is entirely under the jurisdiction of her husband.<QC>
@p1[14]@p2<TIE>He may only annul vows which are self-denial.@bo For example, that she may not taste anything [that I prepare] or that she may not drink any beverage. @p1[15]@p2<TIE>So that you should not say [he may annul] for twenty-four hours.@bo Rashi wishes to answer the question: Why is it necessary to write, “From one day to the next”? We cannot say it comes to teach that if he did not annul it on the day he heard, he can no longer annul it. For the Torah had already written (v. 8), “And her husband heard about them and remained silent on the day he heard, then [her vows] shall stand.” Rashi answers that if it had not written, “From one day to the next” one might have said that previously when it wrote, “On the day he heard” this was [measured] from "moment to moment," namely a twenty-four hour period. @d1Until nightfall.@bo Meaning that if he heard during the day, even if it was close to sunset, once he remained silent until nightfall he can no longer annul. @p1[16]@p2<TIE>Saying, “I approve.”@bo Rashi wishes to answer the question: Why is it written, “If he annuls them after having heard them, he must bear her transgression” which implies that if he annuls them immediately after hearing, he will bear her transgression? But surely [in doing so] he has acted appropriately. We cannot explain that if he heard and endorsed, then later annulled on the same day, they would be annulled. For if so, why does the Torah say, “After having heard them” which implies that if he did not annul her vows immediately upon hearing them, he may not go back and annul them? Therefore, one must say that if he heard her vow and said, “I approve” that he can no longer annul it, even during the same day.<QC>
@p1[2]@p2<TIE>But not against the Moavites.@bo Rashi wishes to answer the question: Why were they commanded to take revenge against the Midianites? Surely the Moavites hired Bil’am, as it is written in Parshas Balak (22:5). You might ask: Why does Rashi bring two reasons here, but in Parshas Pinchas (25:18) he brings only one? The answer is that he is answering another question: Why did the Torah here change its language and write “take revenge” while there it is written (25:17), “Antagonize the Midianites”? Rather, one must say that it was in order to make the inference: “Against the Midianites,” but not against the Moavites. Consequently, we see from the inference of “take revenge” that it was specifically killing them that was forbidden, while hating them was permitted. However, above (ibid.) it is implied that even hating them was forbidden, as it is written, “Antagonize the Midianites” [implying that they could not @ITeven@it antagonize the Moavites]. Thus the verses apparently contradict each other. In response, Rashi here brings two reasons: [Firstly] it is forbidden to kill them, “For the Midianites entered the matter out of fear.<TIE>.<TIE>.” [And secondly] regarding the implication that it is permitted to hate them, this was after the conversion of the "two doves," because the main reason [for not killing them] was for the sake of "two doves," etc. Therefore once the two doves had emerged it was permitted to hate them, however beforehand it was forbidden. @d1Enraged over a dispute which was not theirs.@bo Meaning: They became enraged to quarrel with Yisroel when they, i.e. Yisroel, had not traveled through their land. Thus, they had no reason to quarrel with Yisroel. @d1For the sake of two doves.@bo @hh<HEB>פרידות@ee<ENG> means “doves.” [You might ask: How could he say this] even though only one of them came from Moav. The answer is that Rashi used the language of the Gemara (Bava Kamma 38b). The other interpretation is necessary because according to the first reason there is the difficulty that above it was implied that even Midianites were fearful of Yisroel, as Rashi explained above that, “They made peace between themselves.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (22:4), therefore Rashi brings the other interpretation. However, according to the second interpretation there is the difficulty that Hashem could have arranged that Yisroel would not kill the ancestors of the family of Rus, so why did he command them regarding the entire nation, [saying] not to antagonize Moav? Therefore, Rashi also brings the first reason. @p1[3]@p2<TIE>Although he heard that his demise depended<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo For it is written, “Take @eerevenge.<TIE>.<TIE>. afterward, you shall be gathered to your@ee people” (v. 2). However, if not so [that he joyfully implemented it], why is it necessary to say, “Moshe spoke,” given that ordinarily he related to Yisroel everything that Hashem commanded? @d1Righteous men.@bo For the Torah should not have written “men” given that it is not the nature of women to go out to war, so obviously they were men. Rather, “men” comes to teach you that they were righteous. Likewise, in Parshas Shelach (13:2) Rashi did not explain these words, “Send @ITmen@it for yourself” that they were righteous, because the word “men” was necessary for itself [i.e., to convey the plain meaning]. However, concerning “men” that was written subsequently (13:3) he explained that they were righteous, because the word “men” there is apparently superfluous since “men” had already been mentioned. @ITRe’m@it explains that [Rashi knows this] because it is written, “From among yourselves” and since this statement was addressed to men, it is logical that those who were went to war were men. Therefore, why was it necessary to write “men”? @d1It is as if he stands<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. @boRashi wishes to answer the question: Why is it not written “revenge of Yisroel”? @p1[4]@p2<TIE>This includes the tribe of Levi.@bo One would have said that since the tribe of Levi did not take a portion in the land, they would also not partake in the army. Therefore it was necessary to include them. You might ask: Since the tribe of Levi also went to the army there would be thirteen [thousand] since Ephraim and Menashe were considered [separately] in all of the counts. But it is written, “They were handed over.<TIE>.<TIE>. one thousand from each tribe, twelve thousand.” @ITRe’m@it answers that Ephraim and Menashe were considered two tribes only regarding the inheritance of the Land. Consequently, for the selection of spies which was required as part of the inheritance of the Land, they were considered two tribes. However here, where it was solely [for the purpose] to avenge Hashem, they were referred to as only one tribe. See the commentators who discuss this matter at length.<QC>
@p1[5]@p2<TIE>They refused to go until they were handed over against their wishes.@bo For if not so, it should have said, “Moshe took twelve thousand.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1[6]@p2<TIE>This teaches that Pinchas was equivalent to all of them.@bo For it is written “Moshe sent them [one thousand.<TIE>.<TIE>.].” So why did the Torah repeat itself and write, “Them and Pinchas”? Rather, it was to teach that.<TIE>.<TIE>. @d1Why did Pinchas go.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo It is understandable without this [previous comment], for one would have said that the reason he did not send Elozor was due to Elozor’s importance, since he was equivalent to all of them. However, now that Rashi explained that Pinchas was @ITalso@it equivalent to all of them, why did he send Pinchas? @d1By executing Kozbi .<TIE>.<TIE>. Another interpretation.@bo According to the [first] reason alone there is the difficulty that the principle mitzvah was his executing Zimri, not Kozbi. Therefore Rashi brings the other interpretation that “he sought.<TIE>.<TIE>.” However, according to the other interpretation alone there is the difficulty that [ultimately] it was for Yosef’s benefit that they sold him to the Egyptians, for he became the ruler there. Therefore Rashi brings another interpretation that he was anointed for warfare. However, according to this reason alone there is the difficulty as to why the verse specified Pinchas’ name [teaching] he was anointed for warfare regarding this war more than another war. Therefore Rashi required all the reasons. (@ITGur Aryeh@it) It appears to me that the intent of this teaching is not to say that Pinchas was a reminder for them of what the Midianites did to Yosef, for any love or hatred towards them had already disappeared, and there was no memory of them. Rather, it means that when Moshe saw that the sale of Yosef took place through the Midianites, he realized that the Midianites were his nemesis. For if this were not so, the sale of Yosef would not have taken place through their hand, given that [Hashem] only brings evil upon a person through those who are the antithesis of them. Yosef was the antithesis of Midian, for he scrupulously resisted immorality, while they abandoned their wives and daughters to promiscuity. And this is what Rashi means when he said, “From the children of Yosef who scorned his evil inclination.” Thus, because he scorned his evil inclination he was the antithesis of Midian and they received their punishment through Pinchas, one of the descendants of Yosef, who in contrast to Midian resisted illicit relationships. @d1This refers to the Ark and the Golden Headplate.@bo Because both are termed “holy,” as it is written [concerning the Ark] at the end of Parshas Bamidbar (4:20), “They shall not come in to see when the holy is being covered.” And concerning the Headplate, it is written in Parshas Tetzaveh (Shemos 28:36), “Make a Headplate .<TIE>.<TIE>. holy to Hashem.” @d1In his possession.@bo So that you should not wonder: How could Pinchas have carried all of this in his hand, the Ark with the Headplate and the trumpets?<QC>
@p1[8]@p2<TIE>To receive the reward for the twenty-four thousand.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Why was Bil’am with the Midianites? Surely he was from Aram Naharayim. [And the reason why] he went to the Midianites to ask for his reward rather than going to Balak was because they were the agents of the sin. Alternatively, he may have been there at that time because he passed through on his way to Balak to request his reward. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) The answer [why he went there and not to Balak] is that when he heard Yisroel came to antagonize the Midianites, he went to help them and also to take his reward. Thus, there was a dual cause; for it is possible that he would not have gone to Balak for the reward alone, and consequently this is why he did not go. (@ITGur Aryeh@it) answers that by law, the Moavites were not liable to pay him, because they could claim that when they had agreed to give him a large reward they did so out of fear. We see this concept in the last chapter of Bava Kamma (116a) concerning one who was fleeing prison and offered someone a @ITdinar@it to take him across [a river]. There he can only claim his [normal] fee because the fugitive made his offer only out of fear. Here too Bil’am would receive only a nominal reward, a small amount for the trouble of his speaking and for the advice he had given them. However, the Midianites were not afraid and they promised him a large reward, thus they were obliged to pay his full reward as they had agreed. [Alternatively Bil’am’s advice] was agreeable to Midian but not to Moav, for Moav acted out of fear, while Midian acted out of hatred, as Rashi says that they abandoned their daughters [to promiscuity] (25:15). (@ITKitzur Mizrochi@it) answers that in accordance with the Midrash that Tzur was Balak, consequently he was one of the five kings of Midian, and therefore Bil’am went there to request from him his reward.<QC>
@d1And offered them evil advice.@bo For if not so, how could they have killed him given that he was not a Midianite? One cannot say [they killed Bil’am] because he caused them to sin, for they did not know this until they returned from Midian, as it states (v. 16),@ee @ee“They were the very same ones who, on Bil’am’s advice, were involved with Bnei Yisroel.” Rather, it was because he offered them evil advice [i.e.] to rebel against Hashem’s command. @d1His reward in full<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo One can explain @hh<HEB>משלם@ee<ENG> literally as meaning “in full.” Consequently, @hh<HEB>ולא קפחוהו@ee<ENG> ["without stinting"] would mean that they did not deduct anything for him, rather they paid him in full for the evil that he had done to them. Alternatively one could explain it as @hh<HEB>משלם@ee<ENG> ["from their own'] with a @ITsegol@it under the [letter] @ITshin@it and a @ITkammatz@it under the [letter] @ITlamed,@it meaning, “From that which belongs to the nations,” i.e. the sword was given to them. Since he took up the craft of Yisroel [so they confronted him.<TIE>.<TIE>.] as Rashi explains below.<QC>
@p1[10]@p2<TIE>Ministers.@bo For @hh<HEB>סרני@ee<ENG> is the same as @hh<HEB>שרים@ee<ENG> ["ministers"] and it is rendered by Targum as @hh<HEB>טורני@ee<ENG>. Thus, we see that @hh<HEB>טורני@ee<ENG> means ministers. Furthermore, @hh<HEB>טורני@ee<ENG> is related to @hh<HEB>טירותם@ee<ENG> which [therefore] means the place where ministers sit. According to the last reason alone there is the difficulty that it should have written @hh<HEB>טורנות@ee<ENG>, and according to the first reason there is the difficulty that it should have written @hh<HEB>נוטרותן@ee<ENG>. Therefore, Rashi brings both reasons. @p1[11]@p2<TIE>The plunder of moveable property.@bo As Rashi explains later (v. 32) on the words, “In addition to the @hh<HEB>בז@ee<ENG> ["plunder"] that was taken” that this refers to “what remained after the plunder of moveable property that the warriors plundered for themselves.” This implies that the plunder remained in their possession while the moveable property consisting of ornaments ["booty"] did not. For, this [booty] was brought before Hashem as it is written (v. 50). “We have therefore brought an offering for Hashem.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Thus one is forced to say that @hh<HEB>בז@ee<ENG> ["plunder"] refers to non-ornamental moveable property. @ITRe’m@it writes: However, I do not know from where Rashi learned this, for it would have been more appropriate to say that [@hh<HEB>שלל@ee<ENG> "booty"] includes all moveable property, given that the plunder as a whole was divided into @hh<HEB>שלל@ee<ENG> ["booty"] and @hh<HEB>מלקוח@ee<ENG> ["spoil"]. It appears that Rashi also held that when it is written @hh<HEB>כל השלל@ee<ENG> [all the booty"] it includes everything, whether it was ornamental or not. However Rashi wishes to explain why sometimes Scripture calls it @hh<HEB>שלל@ee<ENG> ["booty"] and sometimes Scripture calls it @hh<HEB>בז@ee<ENG> ["plunder"]. Furthermore, why is it not written (in v. 32), “The spoil was in addition to the @hh<HEB>שלל@ee<ENG> ["booty"] that was taken.<TIE>.<TIE>.”? Rather, one must say that @IThere@it @hh<HEB>שלל@ee<ENG> refers to ornamental moveable property, while @hh<HEB>בז@ee<ENG> refers to non-ornamental moveable property @p1[17]@p2<TIE>Capable of intimate relations.@bo Such as a girl aged three years and one day. Anyone younger than this is not capable of intimate relations. @d1Even if she never actually had relations.@bo Because if it were not so, the verses would apparently be contradictory. For it is written, “Every woman with intimate knowledge of a man” which implies that only an adult who had relations [was executed], but an adult who had not had relations would be kept alive. [Also that] a minor whether she had relations or not would be kept alive. Then it is written (v. 18) “All the children among the females without intimate knowledge of a man, keep alive for yourselves.” This implies specifically a minor who had not had relations, but a minor who had relations, or an adult whether she had relations or not would be killed. Consequently, the first and second verses are apparently contradictory. Therefore Rashi was forced to explain “capable.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @d1For when I read<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. “And all the children among the females.”@bo You might ask: If so [that we might assume they were kept alive], why is it necessary to write (v. 18), “All the children among the females without intimate knowledge of a man, keep alive for yourselves”? For now even a woman who had intimate knowledge of a man was kept alive, so certainly who had not, was kept alive. Rather, we see that since the verse needed to write, “And all the children among the females without intimate knowledge [of a man], keep alive for yourselves,” [it implies] that a woman who had intimate knowledge of a man was killed. One might say that Scripture had to write, “All the children among the females.<TIE>.<TIE>.” because if it had not I would not know whether “Every woman with intimate knowledge of a man” referred to someone who was capable of intimate relations, even though they had not had relations, or perhaps only to one who actually had relations. For the reason why we establish it as referring to someone capable of having relations is because otherwise the verses are apparently contradictory, as explained. @ITRe’m@it answers in a different vein. @d1This is why “[you must] execute” is said.@bo You might ask: Nonetheless, why is it necessary to write “Now execute every male” at the beginning of the verse? The answer is that if it had not written “execute” referring to the males in the beginning of the verse, I would have said that regarding them there was also a difference between someone capable of intimate relations, [i.e.] an adult, and someone who was incapable, [i.e.] a minor. Therefore, the verse said “now execute” in every case. @ITMahari@it answers that if it had not written “execute” the implication of the verse would be that we expound “every woman” with reference to that which is written afterwards. Now, once it refers to the section afterwards we would reverse our logic [as follows]: We would say that if it had only written, “Every woman with intimate knowledge of a man” but it had not written about the children, I would not have used a @ITkal vachomer@it (@ITa fortiori@it argument) to learn that they be kept alive. For I would have said that since she was capable of intimate relations but did not engage in relations, therefore she was kept alive, because she was capable of causing Yisroel to sin but did not do so. However, regarding the children, who were not capable of intimate relations, they have no merit to be kept them alive. Therefore, the Torah wrote “execute” in order to separate [the two]. @p1[19]@p2<TIE>So that they would not enter the Sanctuary courtyard.@bo Rashi wishes to answer the question: Surely someone defiled by a corpse is even permitted to enter the Levite camp, so why does it state, “You shall remain outside the camp”? He answers that “camp” refers to the Sanctuary courtyard.<QC>
@d1That a utensil defiles .<TIE>.<TIE>. as if he had touched the corpse itself.@bo Rashi wishes to answer the question: “Whoever has killed a person” also implies the case where one did not touch him. However, if one shot an arrow and killed him, or killed with a simple wooden utensil that is incapable of receiving contamination, why would he become be defiled? @d1Since “man” was only said in the context of tent contamination.@bo You might ask: Surely concerning [contamination through] touching it also writes “man” in Parshas Chukas, where it is written (19:13), “Whoever touches a corpse of a man’s soul.” See Tosafos Bava Kamma 38a where you will find an explanation for all the verses in which gentiles are also termed “man.”<QC>
@d1They will require sprinkling.@bo [Meaning that] this verse was also said for subsequent generations. This is also holds true for the entire passage of purging utensils. @p1[20]@p2<TIE>This includes utensils made from the horns.@bo Rashi wishes to answer the question: Why was it necessary to say “Everything made of goat products”? Surely it is written “every leather article.” @p1[21]@p2<TIE>He credited the teaching to his master.@bo Meaning that he should not have said that he heard this from his master, instead he should have said it without elaborating, for surely the entire Torah was given through Moshe. Rather, it was in order to relate the matter in the name of the one who said it, as with “And Esther told the king in Mordechai’s name” (Esther 2:22).<QC>
@p1[23]@p2<TIE>In which to cook something.@bo Rashi wishes to answer the question: Just because the artisan made a utensil in fire, would the Torah require one to pass it through fire again? Thus, he explains “in which to cook” and this is an abbreviated verse, for it should have said, “Anything placed on a fire in which to cook [forbidden food].”<QC>
@d1To cleanse it from the contamination of the dead.@bo Thus the word @hh<HEB>נדה@ee<ENG> ["sprinkling"] is in the sense of @hh<HEB>וידו אבן בי@ee<ENG> ["threw a stone at me"] (Eichah 3:53). However, according to the extrapolative interpretation [@hh<HEB>מי נדה@ee<ENG>] is in the sense of @hh<HEB>נדת דותה@ee<ENG> ["@ITniddah@it flow"] (Vayikra 12:2), meaning water suitable for the immersion of the @ITniddah.@it And because the word @hh<HEB>יתחטא@ee<ENG> ["be purified"] is only appropriate for @hh<HEB>החטוי@ee<ENG> ["purification"], Rashi termed the first explanation “the plain interpretation.” Furthermore, because “water suitable for the immersion of the @ITniddah@it” refers to forty @ITse'ah,@it and this is suitable for any impurity, it should have said @hh<HEB>במי טמא יתחטא@ee<ENG> [lit. "be purified with water [suitable for immersion of] the impure"]. Therefore, Rashi says, “The Rabbis extrapolate here.<TIE>.<TIE>.” [rather than considering its plain interpretation]. @d1Immerse them and it is sufficient. @bo[One might ask:] Why did the Torah refer to immersion using the term of “passing” instead of “bringing” as in “it shall be @ITbrought@it into water and remain contaminated until evening” (Vayikra 11:32)? The answer is that since it said above, “You must pass through fire,” which does not mean that it was passed through fire, rather it was brought on the fire, the same is true for “passing” here, that it too is in the sense of being brought, and refers to immersion. Now that immersion is required, one must remove any substance that adhered to the utensil, so that there will not be any interposition during immersion as it is written, “Only the gold.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (v. 22). @p1[26]@p2<TIE>Make an accounting.@bo [Thus @hh<HEB>שא@ee<ENG>] means @hh<HEB>קבל@ee<ENG> ["take" or "receive"] as in @hh<HEB>לא תשא שמע שוא@ee<ENG> ["Do not receive a false report"] (Shemos 23:1). But it is not in the sense of "raising" as in @hh<HEB>ישא פרעה את ראשך@ee<ENG> ["Pharoh will lift off your head"] (Bereishis 40:19). The meaning of @hh<HEB>ראש@ee<ENG> [lit. "head"] is an accounting of the total, as in @hh<HEB>כי תשא את ראש@ee<ENG> ["when you take a census"] (Shemos 30:12). A total is termed @hh<HEB>ראש@ee<ENG> ["head"] because it is the tradition of those who are accounting takers to write the total at the head [i.e. top] of a tally sheet.<QC>
@p1[27]@p2<TIE>Half for these.@bo Rashi wishes to answer the question: The verse implies that those who took part in the war would stand on one side and the rest of the community on the other, and he would divide [the spoils] between these two groups [but the verse does mention anything about distribution]. If so, what was the reason for doing this [i.e., standing on opposite sides]? Furthermore, the verse does not explain to whom [i.e. in what proportion] are the portions to be given. Rashi answers that the verse means to say that half should be given to these and half to these.<QC>
@p1[42]@p2<TIE>For the community, by appropriating it for them<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo Meaning that when the verse writes, “that Moshe divided from the men of the army” it implies that he divided the men themselves. However this is impossible. Furthermore, why does the verse not explain to whom Moshe gave the portion? Thus, Rashi explains “for the community” meaning that he gave it to the community by appropriating it for them @ITfrom@it the military men, and not [the men] themselves. Accordingly, this is an abbreviated verse. @p1[43]@p2<TIE>So much and so much.@bo Not that it comes to teach us the total of this half, because this could be learned from the half-portion of those who partook in the war (v. 36). Rather this section continues until “Moshe took.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (v. 47) [teaching] that he took one fiftieth from this half and gave it to the Levites. Furthermore, if not so it should have said @hh<HEB>מחצית@ee<ENG> ["the half"], however @hh<HEB>ממחצית@ee<ENG> ["@ITfrom@it the half"] indicates that what he took was @ITfrom@it the half.<QC>
@p1[50]@p2<TIE>To atone .<TIE>.<TIE>. concerning the daughters of Midian.@bo You might ask: Was a woman seized in war [@hh<HEB>יפת תואר@ee<ENG>] not permitted to them? The answer is that such a woman would only be permitted after the seven years in which they conquered the land and the seven years in which they divided it. This is also the implication of the Talmud Yerushalmi at the end of Maseches Avodah Zarah. It appears to me that the answer is [as follows:] When the Torah permitted a woman seized in war, it was specifically in a discretionary war. However this war was comparable to an obligatory war [about which it is stated,] “You shall not let any soul live.” And Yisroel did not know this initially, until after Moshe became angry with them over their letting the females live. Therefore [it emerges that] their thoughts concerning the daughters of Midian were in a state of sin. (@ITKitzur Mizrochi@it) In my opinion it is unnecessary to say this, for there the Rabbis state (Kiddushin 21b) that “the Torah spoke against the evil inclination” and call her “dying [but] slaughtered meat” implying that she was not permitted completely. Rather, one who is meticulous should distance himself from her, and this is what is meant [by "their sinful thoughts”].<QC>
@p1[3]@p2<TIE>They were part of the land of Sichon and Og.@bo For afterwards it is written (v. 4), “The land that Hashem struck down.<TIE>.<TIE>.” meaning [the land of] Sichon and Og whom Yisroel defeated, taking their land, as it is detailed in Parshas Chukas (Ch. 21). Alternatively, because it is written (v. 33), “Moshe gave to them, to the tribe of Gad.<TIE>.<TIE>. the empire of Sichon, king of the Emorites and the empire of Og, king of the Bashan” and writing afterwards (v. 34), “The sons of Gad built up Divon and Ataros.<TIE>.<TIE>.” mentioning all of the cities that are written here. Thus, we see that they were part of the land of Sichon and Og, not the cities of Midian that were written before.<QC>
@p1[8]@p2<TIE>There were two places named Kadeish.@bo Meaning that when it writes Kadeish Barnei’a you should not say that it was named Kadeish and its ruler was called Barnei’a, as with Elonei Mamre (Bereishis 13:18) where the owner of the plain was called Mamre. Therefore, Rashi explains, “This was its name” and Kadeish Barnei’a was the name of that place. But since elsewhere (24:14, 33:37) Kadeish is mentioned alone, Rashi therefore explains that there were two places named Kadeish.<QC>
@p1[12]@p2<TIE>To whom Kaleiv’s mother bore Osniel.@bo Rashi wishes to answer the question: Here it is written “Kaleiv son of Yefuneh, the Kenizite.” But if he was the son of Yefuneh then he was not the son of Kenaz, and if he was the son of Kenaz then he was not the son of Yefuneh. Furthermore, elsewhere it only writes Kaleiv son of Yefuneh. He answers that here when it is written, “Son of Yefuneh, the Kenizite” the meaning is as follows: After Yefuneh, Kaleiv’s father, died his mother married Kenaz and bore him Osniel. Thus, Kaleiv was called “son of Yefuneh” [who was his biological father] his father, and [he was also called] “the Kenizite” the name of his mother’s husband.<QC>
@p1[16]@p2<TIE>They were more concerned over their property.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Why did Moshe change [what they said] and say, “Build for yourselves cities for your children and enclosures for your sheep” (v. 24)? He answers that it was because “they were more concerned.<TIE>.<TIE>.”<QC>
@p1[17]@p2<TIE>When we are with our brothers.@bo For otherwise, why would they tell Moshe what would happen [later]? @d1Which we shall build now.@bo Since those that were built previously were destroyed during the war. @p1[19]@p2<TIE>On the western [bank].@bo Rashi was answering the question: Their inheritance was also across the Yardein, so why did they say, “We do not want to take possession.<TIE>.<TIE>.”? Therefore, Rashi explains that “across the Yardein” means the western [bank], meaning that they did not take land on the western side, only on the eastern [bank], as it is written afterwards, “For our inheritance came to us to the east.<TIE>.<TIE>.”<QC>
@p1[24]@p2<TIE>Conjugated from @HB<HEB>צנה@BO<ENG>.@bo Rashi was answering the question: Why is the [letter] @ITnun@it punctuated with a @ITpatach,@it surely throughout Scripture it is punctuated with a @ITsheva.@it @d1For the sake of Heaven.@bo Rashi wishes to answer the question: Why is it written here, “What you have expressed verbally you must fulfill”? This is the terminology used for a vow, where it is written “in accordance with all that he expresses verbally he shall do” (Bamidbar 30:3). [Therefore Rashi] explains [that it is considered a vow] for the law is that speech with regards to heaven is treated like an act of acquisition with regard to a person [i.e., only with regard to heaven does speech have a binding effect]. @ITR. Yaakov Triosh.@it<QC>
@d1And they did so.@bo Meaning that you should not question how he knew that they pledged to do this, for in the Book of Yehoshua (ch. 22) it is written that they did so, they remained until they had inherited the land. Hear from this that this was what they pledged. @p1[25]@p2<TIE>All of them as one man.@bo Rashi was answering the question: Why is it written @hh<HEB>ויאמר@ee<ENG> [lit. "and @IThe@it said"] in the singular form? There were many Gadites. He did not wish to explain like @ITBa’al HaTurim@it that their leader spoke for all of them, apparently because they were two tribes and thus they had two leaders who were able to speak, each one for his own tribe. @ITR. Yaakov Triosh.@it @p1[28]@p2<TIE>Like @HB<HEB>עליהם@BO<ENG> [concerning them].@bo This command was in the sense of appointing, as Rashi subsequently writes, thus the word @hh<HEB>להם@ee<ENG> ["to them"] is inappropriate, rather it should have said @hh<HEB>עליהם@ee<ENG> ["concerning them"]. Therefore Rashi says “like @hh<HEB>עליהם@ee<ENG>.” Since they were only appointed based on certain conditions, he adds “and their stipulation.” He says that we find the word @hh<HEB>להם@ee<ENG> ["to" or "for you"] meaning “concerning you” as in “Hashem will fight for you” which means @hh<HEB>עליכם@ee@BO<ENG> @bo["concerning you"] as if to say “on your behalf.”<QC>
@p1[32]@p2<TIE>In our possession will be<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo Rashi wishes to answer the question: When it wrote@hh<HEB>ואתנו אחוזת נחלתנו מעבר לירדן@ee<ENG> [lit. "and with us, our permanent inheritance on this side of the Yardein"] to the east, this implies that they took the land with them, but this is impossible. He also has a further difficulty as to why is it written @hh<HEB>מעבר לירדן@ee<ENG> [lit. "on the other side of the Yardein"]? Surely they took their inheritance on this side. [In answering] Rashi adds the word “will be” because the statement, “In our hands, in our possession our hereditary territory” might imply that the hereditary territory was already in their hands. Therefore Rashi adds the word “will be” because they had not yet taken this territory, and would only do so after the fulfillment of the conditions. Consequently, they meant that their inheritance would come to them after the fulfillment of the conditions, as if they had said that after the fulfillment of the conditions they would no longer request to take possession across the Yardein and beyond. For they would have received their inheritance on the eastern side of the Yardein, retroactive to the time before they crossed, once they had fulfilled the conditions, given that they had already made an acquisition of their inheritance by building pens for sheep and flocks, and [building] cities for the children and settling within them.<QC>
@p1[36]@p2<TIE>To serve as fortified cities<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. @boNot that this was the reality, and the verse indicates that each of the cities mentioned were fortified and having pens for sheep, for if so, what is meant by “[the sons of Gad] built up” (v. 34) — surely they would had already been built.<QC>
@p1[38]@p2<TIE>Would name their cities after idols.@bo Meaning that [the Reuvenites] changed the names of the cities before rebuilding them, in order not to recall the names of the idols, for Nevo and Ba’al Me’on were the names of idols, and [the Emorites] named these cities after them. Thus, the sons of Reuven changed their names, as the Rabbis teach [they were named] Beis Galiah and Beis Kariah. However, the names of the other cities were changed @ITafter@it rebuilding them, as is the manner of all city builders. @d1They built Sivmah<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo Rashi wishes to answer the question: Why did the verse not mention them together [writing] “Nevo, Ba’al Me’on and Sivmah, their names having been changed.”? Rashi answers that it was specifically Nevo and Ba’al Me’on that had their names changed, in accordance with the comment that before they were rebuilt their names were changed in order not to recall the names of idols. However, the names of the other cities were changed after having been rebuilt. Thus, “Sivmah” is associated with the word “built” (v. 37) above, but not with “their names having been changed.” Rashi says that one should not think that it is associated with “their names having been changed” because Sevam and Sivmah are one and the same. @p1[42]@p2<TIE>How he would expound two [similar] words.@bo @ITRamban,@it together with the other commentators raise the difficulty: How is it that Rashi did not see in Midrash Rus (5:5) [which teaches]: “I am not even like one of your maidservants” (Rus 2:13). Boaz said to her, "Heaven forbid! You are not one of the maidservants, rather one of the matriarchs." Similarly regarding “Novach went.<TIE>.<TIE>.” [which teaches that the name did not endure] and similarly, “He said to me: To build her a house in the land of Shinar” (Zechariah 5:11), which teaches that there is no salvation for falsehood. See there. It appears to me that Rashi was also aware of the Midrash, however when he wrote, “I wonder.<TIE>.<TIE>.” this is in accordance with R’ Moshe Hadarshan’s comment that the name of the city did not endure and therefore it is written @hh<HEB>לה@ee<ENG> which is silent, as if it had written @hh<HEB>לא נבח@ee<ENG> ["not Novach"], for its name did not endure, rather it received another name. Thus one needs to expound the same inference for “Boaz said to her,” that Boaz did not [say it himself], rather it was an emissary, but this could not be. Similarly with “To build her a house,” [it would mean] not a house, rather a tent but this could not be. Therefore, Rashi chose his words and said, “How he would expound” meaning that since he expounds like this here, he should also do so there, but this would not be possible. In truth, the name of the city was not changed, for it was named after Novach. Yet, when it is written @hh<HEB>לה@ee<ENG> which is silent, this is because although Novach and the others named the city after Novach, his sons did not call it Novach. As @ITRambam@it writes (Mamrim 6:3) and is brought by Tur (Yoreh De’ah 240) that if the name of one's father was the same as that of others, one should change the name of the others [in order to avoid mentioning the name of one's father]. This appears to me to be the explanation of Rashi’s words.<QC>





















 @p1[1]@p2<TIE>You learn that it was in the desert of Paran.@bo Paran was a large plain which included a place called Rismah, thus we see that the decree of the spies was at Rismah. @d1That throughout the thirty-eight years<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo For the decree was only for thirty-eight years, as Rashi explains in Parshas Devarim (1:46). You might ask: From Rismah until Mount Hor there were only nineteen journeys, thus there should have been just forty-@eeone @eejourneys, however Rashi above explained that there were forty-two. See Parshas Chukas (21:4) where Rashi explains that there were seven journeys from Moseirah until Mount Hor (and the comment of Sifsei Chachamim there). @d1Expounds the matter differently.@bo Meaning: This is why the journeys were enumerated.<TIE>.<TIE>. @d1Here we slept.@bo Meaning: Here @ITyou@it slept. Likewise, Hashem enumerated all the journeys as if to say that on this journey you did this, and on that journey such-and-such happened to you. @d1We were chilled.@bo In the sense of being chilled, for it is common for those who are sick to be comforted when one cools them.<QC>
@p1[4]@p2<TIE>They were preoccupied with their grief.@bo Meaning: This is an explanation of what is written previously, “Yisroel left triumphantly.” For why would the Egyptians have allowed them to do so? Scripture explains that “Egypt was burying.<TIE>.<TIE>.” and thus they were preoccupied with their grief. If it had referred to the burial itself, this would not have been visible to all of Egypt. Now, given that the Torah writes, “Triumphantly, @ITbefore the eyes of all Egyptians@it” this apparently repetitive language must certainly be to inform that all of them actually saw [the departure]. However, if they were burying, like the plain understanding, not everyone would have seen, for they would have to bury in the burial grounds. Therefore, Rashi explains that “they were preoccupied.<TIE>.<TIE>.” and “burying” means that they were also preoccupied with burial. @ITR. Yaakov Triosh.@it<QC>
@p1[18]@p2<TIE>So named after [the spies’] slander.@bo Rashi wishes to answer the question: Why here was it called Rismoh, while elsewhere it was called Paran? (@ITDevek Tov@it) The reason why Rashi commented on this journey more than the others was that here it is written, “They journeyed from Chatzeiros and camped in Rismoh” while in Parshas Beha'aloscha (14:16) it is written “afterwards the people travelled from Chatzeiros and they camped in the desert of Paran.” Therefore, he explains that it was “so named after the slander.<TIE>.<TIE>.” meaning that both refer to the same place.<QC>
@p1[38]@p2<TIE>This teaches that he died by the Divine kiss.@bo Meaning: That @hh<HEB>על פי ה'@ee<ENG> [lit. "by the mouth of Hashem" is expounded both forward and backward. [One reads backward, teaching] “Aharon ascended by the word of Hashem” and one also reads [forward,] that “By the mouth of Hashem he died there.” @p1[40]@p2<TIE>This teaches<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo Meaning: Above in Parshas Chukas (21:1) following the death of Aharon it is also written, “The Canaanite [King] heard.<TIE>.<TIE>.” However, there it was not clear that he heard about the death of Aharon, for one could have said that he heard what was said subsequently, “That Yisroel had come by the route of the spies.” But here the Torah does not make any comment afterward; therefore @IThere@it it is clear that “the death of Aharon [was the news.<TIE>.<TIE>.]” It is here that Rashi comments, “This teaches you that the death of Aharon was the news he heard” because it is written “Aharon was one hundred and twenty-three years old at his death.<TIE>.<TIE>. and the Canaanite heard.” However in Parshas @eeChukas@ee we did not know what he heard, whether it was about the death of Aharon or about their weeping, since both of are written there (20:29). @p1[49]@p2<TIE>The measure of the Israelite camp.@bo For the three @ITparsa'os@it from Beis Yeshimos until Aveil Hasheetim were equivalent to twelve @ITmils.@it @d1The Plain of Sheetim was entitled “Aveil.”@bo However, the meaning of “Aveil” is not “plain.” In Parshas Lech Lecha (Bereishis 14:6) Rashi comments on this matter at length. [Though] the Targum renders Aveil as @hh<HEB>מישור@ee<ENG> ["plain"], this explanation is according to the context and the term. @p1[52]@p2<TIE>You shall oust.@bo For if it was in the sense of inheritance, it should have said @hh<HEB>וירשתם@ee<ENG> ["you shall inherit"]. Alternatively if it meant inheritance, the Torah should not have said, “Before @eeyou@ee” because the word “before you” is not appropriate for inheritance. @d1On which to prostrate themselves.@bo Rashi wishes to prove that @hh<HEB>משכית@ee<ENG> is in the sense of a floor, since it is written in the verse @hh<HEB>ואבן משכית@ee<ENG> ["overlaid stones"]. He also wishes to prove his comment, “To prostrate themselves with arms and legs extended.” [He derives this from the fact that] it is written, “On which to prostrate yourselves,” and regarding Yosef it is written (Bereishis 37:10), “To prostrate to you upon the ground” which refers to extending the arms and legs.<QC>
@p1[53]@p2<TIE>Of its inhabitants.@bo Because @hh<HEB>הורשה@ee<ENG> is an expression of expulsion, therefore when it is written @hh<HEB>את הארץ@ee<ENG> [lit. "[drive out] the land"] it means the inhabitants of the land. @d1You shall be able to endure there.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo For if not so, surely it is already written, “drive out” thus it should have continued, “You shall give [the land] as an inheritance.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Rather, this was said conditionally [i.e.] that if you drive them out you will be able to endure.<QC>
@p1[54]@p2<TIE>Taking into account those who came out of Egypt.@bo Here Rashi does not explain as he did in Parshas Pinchas (26:53), for there his explanation implied that they divided [the land] according to those who entered the land and had reached twenty years of age. There is a dispute in Bava Basra 117a, and one opinion is that [the words] “The land shall be apportioned among these.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (26:53) refers to those who entered the land, and there he explained in accordance with that opinion. However, here Rashi explains in accordance with the opinion that [the words] “The land shall be apportioned among these” refers to those who came out of Egypt. [Alternatively] it is possible to give a forced answer that this is in accordance with the explanation above (26:55) that “This inheritance is different [from all others.<TIE>.<TIE>.]” @d1With twelve border demarcations.@bo Meaning: The entire border demarcation was referred to by its tribe [e.g.] this being the border demarcation of Reuven and that being the border demarcation of Shimon. Now we can understand Rashi’s comment in Parshas Vayechi (Bereishis 48:6) that [even though the land was apportioned by population], “Nonetheless only these were termed tribes.<TIE>.<TIE>.” as meaning that the inheritance of Ephraim and Menashe would also be referred to by their name, as the border of Ephraim or the border of Menashe. @ITRe’m@it writes: This is puzzling, because this is not like either opinion (Bava Basra 117a). For Rabbi Yoshiya says the land was apportioned to those who left Egypt, as it says, “According to the names of their fathers’ tribes should they inherit it” (26:55), while Rabbi Yochanan says that the land of Israel was apportioned to those who came into the land, as it says, “The land shall be apportioned among these.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (26:53). Therefore, how am I to understand [Rashi’s comment (26:55)] “according to the names of their tribes — this inheritance is different.<TIE>.<TIE>.”? He leaves the question unresolved. The answer is that Rashi is answering a question: According to both explanations there is a difficulty as to what is meant by “According to [the names] of their fathers’ tribes.” For it should have merely said, “According to the names of their fathers should they inherit it.” Why was the word “tribes” necessary? Rather, one must say that it was also to expound, “With twelve border demarcations.<TIE>.<TIE>.” This forced Rashi to bring the other interpretation. However, according to the second interpretation there is also the difficulty as to why it said, “fathers” for it should have merely said, “According to the names of the tribes”. Therefore the first reason is also necessary. @p1[55]@p2<TIE>Shall be evil for you.@bo Rashi wishes to answer the question: The verse implies that they would be left over intentionally, for this reason, so that they would be as spikes. Furthermore, it is not appropriate to say about people that they would be @hh<HEB>שכים@ee<ENG> which means spikes, as Rashi explains (s.v. "as spikes"). He answers that they shall be evil to you, meaning that @ITif@it you leave them over they will be evil to you. This means that they will not literally be spikes against you, rather they will be evil, to do evil to you. @d1Denoting a barrier.@bo [@hh<HEB>מסוכת@ee<ENG>, "barrier"] is similar to @hh<HEB>מסך פתח@ee<ENG> ["a screen at the entrance"] (Shemos 39:38) with the connotation of a barrier which encloses.<QC>
@p1[2]@p2<TIE>The outer reaches of the borders.@bo This following rule should be considered: Wherever Rashi mentions the term @hh<HEB>מיצר@ee<ENG> ["outer reaches"] he means “the border” [i.e.] the line that circumscribes the land of Israel. @d1In terms of falling.@bo As in @hh<HEB>הפיל פור הוא הגורל@ee<ENG> ["the @ITpur@it was cast, which is the lot"] (Esther 3:7).<QC>
@p1[3]@p2<TIE>From east to west.@bo Meaning that it is not literally the southern corner, rather the entire southern side is termed the flank, from the southeastern corner to the southwestern corner. @d1Southeastern.@bo Thus “along Edom” means “which adjoins it [Edom]” teaching that the place where the Tzin wilderness abuts the land of Canaan, which is the land of the nine tribes, and it is on its southeastern corner. @d1Three countries.@bo All of Rashi’s words are clearly understood by anyone who looks at the configuration of the border of the land of Israel. @d1From the [river] Shichor.@bo The Shichor is the Nile. @d1With the land of Moav.@bo Subsequently it is written (Shoftim 11:19), “Then Yisroel sent messengers to Sichon.<TIE>.<TIE>.” implying that initially their journey around was from west to the east, at the southern side of Edom and Moav. Then, when they reached the southeastern edge, they turned northward to go around the eastern border of Moav. Once they had gone around the eastern border, it is written afterwards, “Then Yisroel sent.<TIE>.<TIE>.” for they had reached the land of Sichon and Og. @d1Adjoining the land of Edom.@bo This refers to [what is written] before, meaning that [since the southeastern border was adjacent to Edom], therefore it is written “from the Tzin wilderness, along Edom.”<QC>
@p1[4]@p2<TIE>Bending towards the north.@bo Meaning: It bends in the direction of the land of Israel, and the border broadens, resulting in the land of Israel narrowing, for as much as the border broadens into the land of Israel, the land of Israel becomes narrower. @d1Within the border.@bo For it is written, “South of Maaleh Akrabim.” This implies that the border, the outer reach [of the land], was to the south of Maaleh Akrabim. However, where it is written “passing” it implies that the border passes through the city. @d1To Tzin.@bo Because a [letter] @IThei@it at the end of the word is in place of a [letter] @ITlamed@it at the beginning. @d1Angling.@bo Meaning: The border of the land of Israel broadens at the south, and consequently the border broadens northward. @d1The term “turns” is used here.@bo Meaning: When it is written (v. 5), “The border turns from Atzmon toward the Egyptian Estuary” this does not have the same meaning as @hh<HEB>ונסב@ee<ENG> ["turns"] above, for above it means that the border @ITbent@it towards the land of Israel, resulting in the land of Israel narrowing while the border broadened. However, @hh<HEB>ונסב@ee<ENG> written here (v. 5) means that it turned towards the Egyptian Estuary which is southward, resulting in the border narrowing and the land of Israel broadening. @d1From there onward.@bo Meaning that it did not broaden any more once it reached Chatzar Adar, rather it remained in its original breadth. However from Atzmon it began to become narrower until it reached the Estuary of Egypt. @p1[6]@p2<TIE>The islands.@bo From the apparently superfluous word “border,” we include the islands also. @p1[7]@p2<TIE>And some outward.@bo Meaning that on the western side [the sea] circles the mountain on the inner side, i.e., the side of the land of Israel, and on the outer side, meaning outside the land. @p1[8]@p2<TIE>For [that dimension] ends there.@bo Meaning that from Tzedad until Chatzar Einan the border continues southward, from the west to east, resulting in the land of Israel narrowing while the border broadens.<QC>
@p1[15]@p2<TIE>The eastern direction.@bo Meaning that @hh<HEB>קדמה@ee<ENG> ["to the east"] is in the sense of the front, and the [letter] @IThei@it at the end is in place of a [letter] @ITlamed@it at the beginning. When Rashi comments @hh<HEB>אל פני@ee<ENG> this means “to the forefront” and thus he continues to explain to what “forefront” refers, commenting “of the world.” This means towards the front of the world, i.e. the east, “As the [eastern] direction.<TIE>.<TIE>.”<QC>
@p1[17]@p2<TIE>For your sake.@bo The word @hh<HEB>ינחלו@ee<ENG> ["shall inherit"] implies that they would inherit it themselves ["i.e., on their own"], while @hh<HEB>לכם@ee<ENG> ["for you"] implies that they would cause you to inherit it. Therefore, Rashi explains, “Who shall inherit for your sake.” @d1He apportioned the tribal inheritance.@bo For if not so, there were minors who were not of the age [to appoint] emissaries; also there were those who preferred [their portions in] the hills or the valleys [in both cases the actions of an emissary would not normally be effective]. Rather, [here] what the guardian did was binding. However, this was for the apportioning of the tribal inheritance to the families, and from the families to the individuals. But the apportioning of the land itself to the tribes was by lot, and thus not dependent upon the actions of the guardian. @d1He chose [a suitable portion] for each individual.@bo The reason why Rashi does not also mention that the leaders initially apportioned [the land] to the tribes, and only afterwards to the families and the individuals, is because the leaders did not apportion it to the tribes, rather it was apportioned to the tribes by lot. @d1Shall inherit for you.@bo Rashi wishes to answer the question: If so, why it is written @hh<HEB>לכם@ee<ENG> [lit. "@ITTo@it you"]? Rather [it means] for your sake.<QC>
@p1[12]@p2<TIE>Against the blood redeemer.@bo Meaning that @hh<HEB>מגואל@ee<ENG> ["from the avenger"] refers to the blood redeemer. Rashi continues to explain which person is termed the blood redeemer, given the name “redeemer” could refer either to the redeemer of the murderer or to the redeemer of the victim. Therefore Rashi explains that he is a kinsman of the victim.<QC>
@p1[13]@p2<TIE>The three that Yehoshua placed.@bo Rashi wishes to answer the question: Why did it write the number? Surely when it is written afterwards (v. 14), “three cities you shall give.<TIE>.<TIE>.” [Therefore] we see that there were a total of six. Rather, it was to teach that they did not provide refuge until all six were established. @p1[14]@p2<TIE>Rife with murderers.@bo You might ask: Surely the cities of refuge would only provide refuge for inadvertent killers, and it is illogical to say that Gil’ad was rife with inadvertent killers. The answer is that they were certainly intentional killers, however there were no witnesses and thus they claimed that they killed inadvertently. Consequently, they required three cities of refuge. @ITRe’m.@it Another answer is that this refers to a matter detailed in Parshas Mishpatim (Shemos 21:13), “Hashem caused it to come to his hand” teaching that Hashem arranges for them to be at the same inn.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (see below). Here too it refers to the same matter. There were many murderers in Gil’ad who acted with intent but without witnesses, and in the land of Israel there were many inadvertent killers without witnesses. So what did Hashem do? He would arrange for them to be at the same inn, in Gil’ad, and the inadvertent killers from the land of Israel would inadvertently kill the intentional killers. For example, when [the murderer] was sitting beneath a ladder as Rashi explains there [the inadvertent killer would accidentally fall upon the murderer, killing him in front of witnesses]. Consequently, the intentional killers would be killed while the inadvertent killers would be exiled there in Gil’ad to these cities of refuge. Thus, it was necessary to have three cities of refuge in Gil’ad like in the entire land of Israel. (@ITDivrei Dovid@it) answers the question with the Gemara in @ITPerek Eilu Hen Hagolin@it (Makkos 10b): It was taught in a @ITberaysa@it: Rabbi Yosi bar Yehudah says that initially both inadvertent and intentional killers go to the cities of refuge, and the Beis Din sends messengers to bring them [for judgment]. Whoever is liable for the death penalty is executed, as it says (Devarim 19:12), “The elders of his city shall send for him and take him from there.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Whoever is not liable is released, and whoever is liable for exile (i.e., city of refuge) is returned to the place [from where he was taken]. @d1Bloody ambush.@bo @hh<HEB>עקובה@ee<ENG> is in the sense of an ambush. @p1[16]@p2<TIE>Of a size capable.@bo @hh<HEB>כמיסת @ee<ENG> means “of a size.”<QC>
@d1But it states.@bo Meaning that when it is written, “If [he struck him] with an iron instrument.<TIE>.<TIE>. or if with a stone that can be held in the hand.<TIE>.<TIE>. or if with a wooden implement.<TIE>.<TIE>.” until “If [he pushes] out of hatred” (v. 20) perhaps it is referring to an inadvertent killer. And this was necessary [in contrast with the verses below] so that you would not say as follows: It is understandable if this refers to an inadvertent killer, that it would have had to say, “And if with an iron instrument” and all of the other cases that follow, in order to teach that he is liable for the death penalty, even if he killed inadvertently. But, if it refers to an intentional killer, what difference does it make whether he killed with an iron or any other instrument? Surely he is an intentional killer. However, when it is written afterwards (v. 21), “Or if in enmity.<TIE>.<TIE>.” until “But if suddenly” (v. 22) [it is clear that] these undoubtedly refer to an intentional killer. @d1With a stone.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Why does Scripture write about “a stone” (v. 23)? Surely above it is also written about a stone, where it [apparently] also refers to an inadvertent killer. Rather, “This teaches that in its statements above.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1[17]@p2<TIE>Large enough.@bo You might ask: Surely it is written, “A stone that can be held in the hand” and Rashi explains that this is “large enough to fill the hand,” meaning that it is large enough to kill. The answer is that one phrase teaches that it is large enough to kill when one strikes, and one phrase teaches that it is large enough to kill when one throws it. For sometimes it would be large enough to kill when striking but not when thrown, and if one were to throw it and kill, I might have said that he was culpable. Consequently, we are informed that he is not culpable until it is large enough to kill when thrown. With this we can answer the question of @ITRe’m@it who writes “I do not know.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1[19]@p2<TIE>Even inside the cities of refuge.@bo For here the Torah speaks about a premeditated killer, as Rashi explains above (v. 16). If Beis Din did not execute him and he exiled himself to a city of refuge without its authorization, then [the avenger] could kill him, even inside the city of refuge. For if not so, why does the Torah write “where ever he meets him”? Surely it had already written, “The blood avenger shall kill the murderer.”<QC>
@p1[23]@p2<TIE>He struck him.@bo Without the additional phrase, “He struck him,” we would understand “without seeing” is associated with “which can kill” as if to say that he did not see his death. However this is not so, rather it means to say that he did not see when he struck him. Furthermore, without the additional wording the phrase, “Or even with a stone” would obviously be missing [a verb], since it should have said, “Or even @ITstruck@it with a stone.” For if it referred back to [the verb] “threw” (v. 22), the verse should have said @hh<HEB>או כל אבן@ee<ENG> ["or even a stone"]. @d1While descending.@bo Such as where one was rolling a roller downward and it fell upon a person and killed him, or where one was lowering a bundle and it fell upon a person, or one was descending a ladder and fell upon a person and killed him, [in all these cases] he is exiled. @d1While ascending is not exiled.@bo If one was pushing a roller upward and it fell on a person and killed him, or one was raising a barrel and the rope broke and the barrel fell on a person and killed him, or where one was ascending a ladder and fell upon a person and killed him, he is not exiled. The reason is that because all of these [deaths] were as a result of moving upward and he was not obliged to be cautious. @p1[25]@p2<TIE>That this [pitfall] not occur.@bo According to the first interpretation there is the difficulty that it is written, “Until the death of the Kohein Gadol.” The verse is saying that the murderer will live after the death of the Kohein Gadol, since the Kohein Gadol would die sooner, but why would this be? Therefore, Rashi explains, “Because he should have.<TIE>.<TIE>.” However, according to the second interpretation there is the difficulty that even if the Kohein Gadol was punished with death for not praying, why should the murderer return home after the death of the Kohein Gadol? Therefore, he also brings the first reason.<QC>
@d1Who anointed him.@bo The verse implies that the murderer anointed the Kohein Gadol with the sacred oil, therefore one must say that this is one of the shortened passages.<TIE>.<TIE>.<QC>
@p1[29]@p2<TIE>So long [as it functions].@bo For it is written in Parshas Shoftim (Devarim 17:8), “You shall ascend to the place” which teaches that it is “the place” which confers authority. This means: At the time when the Great Sanhedrin of Yerushalyim sit in the Chamber of Hewn Stone [in the Temple, the lower] courts function outside the land and in other locations [within the land] are in effect. @p1[30]@p2<TIE>The one who endeavors to kill him.@bo Referring to the killer, because he had killed a person. @d1And was forewarned.@bo Meaning that this is one of the shortened passages, and it is as if the verse had said if anyone strikes a person, meaning that he killed a person, he may not be killed unless there is testimony that he killed intentionally and that he was forewarned.<QC>
@p1[31]@p2<TIE>He cannot absolve himself.@bo Meaning that this is one of the shortened passages, and it is as if the verse had said, “Do not accept atonement compensation for the life of a murderer who is wicked to incur the death penalty, @ITto exempt him from death,@it for he must be executed.” Since in Parshas Mishpatim the Torah writes (Shemos 21:29), “If it was a goring ox.<TIE>.<TIE>. and it killed a man or woman, the ox shall be stoned and its owners shall also die,” [where his death] is at the hands of the heavenly court. This implies that just as his ox is liable for death, so too he is liable for death. Nonetheless, afterwards it is written (v. 30), “When an atonement compensation is imposed upon him, he must give a redemption of his soul,” which implies that if he was liable for the death penalty on account of his ox, he can absolve himself with money. Therefore, I would have thought that the same is true if he was liable for the death penalty on his own account, that he could absolve himself with money. @p1[32]@p2<TIE>Like @HB<HEB>לנס@BO<ENG>.@bo With a @ITsheva@it below the [letter] @ITlamed@it and a @ITkamatz@it below the [letter] @ITnun@it [@hh<HEB>לנס@ee<ENG> "one who has fled" rather than @hh<HEB>לנוס@ee<ENG> "to flee"], meaning that just as there is no redemption for the death penalty, so too there is no redemption for exile.<QC>
@p1[33]@p2<TIE>Do not bring evil.@bo For the word @hh<HEB>חנופה@ee<ENG> [lit. "false flattery"] is not appropriate when referring to blood. With regard to the land this term is understandable, since @hh<HEB>חנופה@ee<ENG> would be appropriate if “land” is explained as referring to the inhabitants of the land, with whom false flattery is possible. However, regarding blood, it cannot be explained in this manner.<QC>
@p1[4]@p2<TIE>R’ Yehudah said.@bo Rashi wishes to answer the question: Why is it written @hh<HEB>ואם@ee<ENG> ["and if"], since it should have said @hh<HEB>וכי יהיה@ee<ENG> ["and @ITwhen@it [the @ITyoveil@it] occurs"]. For @hh<HEB>ואם@ee<ENG> implies that there is doubt as to whether there would be a @ITyoveil.@it When Rashi writes afterwards “so even if @ITyoveil@it occurs” he does not mean to explain @hh<HEB>ואם@ee<ENG> as meaning @hh<HEB>אפילו@ee<ENG> ["even when"], for if so he would be contradicting what he said above, that the word @hh<HEB>ואם@ee<ENG> implies doubt. Rather, the word “even” is part of Rashi’s usage of language, and it is not meant to be an explanation of the word @hh<HEB>אם@ee<ENG>. @d1To discontinue.@bo Meaning that the Temple will be destroyed and @ITshmittah@it and @ITyoveil@it will be discontinued.<QC>
@p1[11]@p2<TIE>And they were married.@bo Rashi is answering the question: In Parshas Pinchas (27:1) Scripture mentioned Sirtzah at the end, while here she is mentioned second. He answers that here they are listed in the order of seniority [i.e., age], meaning that here it is written, “They were.<TIE>.<TIE>.wives to their cousins” and it is customary for sisters to marry in order of their birth, first the oldest and afterward the younger ones in order of their age, as it is written [referring to marrying the younger daughter before the older] (Bereishis 29:26), “Such is not done in our place.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @d1Throughout Scripture.@bo [You might ask why] Rashi did not make any comment in Parshas Pinchas (26:33) in the section dealing with the order of the families and the counting of the tribes, where the daughters of Tzelofchad were mentioned. You cannot say that it was because Rashi had no difficulty until now that the order has been changed, for if so, why in Parshas Pinchas did Rashi comment on the verse, “And the daughters of Tzelofchad approached” (27:1), given that there was not [yet] any change [in their order]. Yet Rashi there wrote, “Below it says, ‘Machlah and Sirtzah were.<TIE>.<TIE>.’” Thus, with regards to [order of Tzelofchad’s daughters] in the count of the generations of the tribes he should also have said “below.<TIE>.<TIE>.” There is an additional difficulty that regarding, “They approached” Rashi only explained, “This teaches that they were all equal,” while here he elaborates, commenting, “@ITAccording to their wisdom,@it this teaches that they were all equal” meaning that [they were equal] in righteousness and in performing good deeds. It appears that initially in Parshas Pinchas, regarding the order in the counting of the tribes, it would have been incongruous to comment, “Below it changes [the order] in order to teach that they were all equal.” For there would have been the difficulty as to how we could know that they were equal, since perhaps Scripture changed the order and listed them in order of their wisdom. However, regarding “they approached” Scripture still had not changed the original order. Thus, we would have said that since it was not changed in those two cases, we cannot say that below [i.e., here] it was changed on account of their wisdom. For if so, Scripture should have changed the order in the verse “they approached” given that there their wisdom was demonstrated, as Rashi explains (27:4), “[This teaches] that they were learned.” Now, since it was not changed there, one can say it is certain that the change in the order of their listing below [i.e., here] teaches that they were equal [and is not in order of their wisdom]. At this stage, we would have said that on the first two occasions they were listed in order of their birth. However, here it is clear that this is the order of their birth, since they married in order [of their age], if so, in on the first two occasions the order was changed. Rather, [the answer is that] this was to demonstrate that there are listed in accordance with two reasons, “According to their wisdom” and “Teaches that they were equal,” given that the order was changed twice. @ITR.Yaakov Triosh.<QC>
