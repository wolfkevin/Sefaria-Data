@p1[1]@p2<TIE>Though [Scripture] has previously enumerated them during their lifetime, etc.@p3 Rashi questions the need to count them [the Bnei Yisrael] a second time. They had previously been counted in Parshas Vayeishev (Bereishis 46:8). One cannot argue that they were previously counted while alive and now they were being counted after death because this makes no difference [in the count] since they had already been counted. This is why Rashi expounds, “[This is] to show,” etc. Rashi finds further difficulty with the “vav” [=<TIE>and] at the beginning of the word @hh<HEB>ואלה@ee<ENG> [And these]. “‘These’ are the names,” would have been sufficient. @d1It again enumerates them at their deaths,@p3 but without using the phrase “by their names” in conjunction with their death. Previously (Ibid.) while alive a detailed count was made (including their extended families) whereas in death, only the tribal leaders were counted. As it is written here “seventy souls.” @d1To show how dear they are [to God], because they are compared to the stars.@p3 Do not ask “what is this dearness” that they are compared to the stars. The answer is that just as the stars are exist forever and illuminate by day and night, but their illumintation is not visible during the day because “light at midday is of no value,” so too does Yisrael exist in this world and in the World to Come. @d1Which He brings out and brings in by number and by their [individual] names@p3; The words “and by their names” refer only to the words “and He brings them in.” But concerning taking them out, (Hashem takes them out) only by number and not by name as it says in the verse, “Who brings out their host by number, and calls each by its name (when bringing them back in)” — concerning taking them out it is written “by number,” and (only) concerning bringing them in it is written “by name.” (@ITMizrachi@it) @p1[5]@p2<TIE>But, were not he and his sons included in the seventy?@p3 And if so, Yoseif’s name should have been included with those of seventy. In other words, it should have come before the sum total of Yaakov’s descendants. @d1Would we not know ourselves that he was in Egypt?@p3 We might suggest an answer [to Rashi’s original question]: It was necessary to write that Yoseif was in Egypt [and therefore mentioned him separately]. However, [as Rashi here points out,] another question would arise: “Would we not know<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.?” The @ITRe”m@it writes at length where he could have been brief, saying Rashi holds that @hh<HEB>ויוסף@ee<ENG> (“Yoseif who was”) relates to what was written above, telling us that with Yoseif there were seventy souls. And it is so stated in Shemos Rabbah (1:7). Thus Rashi asks: “But, were not he and his sons included<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.?” So why then is Yoseif mentioned alone, [without his sons]? It is understandable regarding the other tribes because they all are covered by the phrase “@hh<HEB>איש וביתו@ee<ENG> (Each man with his household),” but this phrase does not relate to Yoseif. Therefore, just as Yoseif is mentioned, so too his sons should have been mentioned. Alternatively, we might suggest that [Rashi does not hold that] “Yoseif who was” relates to what was written above. And “Yoseif and his sons” do not need to be mentioned, since all of them were already included in the count of seventy souls. Rather, “Yoseif who was” tells us that Yoseif was in Egypt. On this Rashi questions: Then what does [Scripture] intend to teach us? (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @d1The same Yoseif who tended his father’s sheep.@p3 That is to say: since Yoseif was so lowly and humble, perhaps he sinned, since poverty induces a person to sin. Or since Yoseif was a king, perhaps he sinned as a result of his high status. But since this count (of B’nei Yisrael) is after their deaths, it tells here of Yoseif’s righteousness. For our Rabbis of blessed memory say (Avos 2 :4): “Do not trust yourself [that you will not sin,] until the day of your death.” @p1[7]@p2<TIE>They bore six children at one time.@p3 The @ITRe”m@it writes that in Shemos Rabbah (1:8) the number of births at one time is derived from the six words in the verse [@hh<HEB>פרו .<TIE>.<TIE>. מאד@ee<ENG>]. But I would say Rashi is following a view in Yalkut Shimoni that compare them to the largest rodent; the rat gives birth to six at one time.” We see that Rashi is follows this view because he derives the number of births at one time from the word @hh<HEB>וישרצו@ee<ENG>. [This word is a variation of the word @hh<HEB>שרץ@ee<ENG>, “rodent”]. Since the common phrase “were fruitful and multiplied” is interrupted by “and prolific,” which is unusual, certainly the reason for this interruption is because “fruitful” implies one offspring, whereas “multiplied” implies many offspring, as Rashi explained in Parshas Bereishis (1:22). Thus, “prolific” interrupts the phrase “fruitful and multiplied” to teach that the number of offspring born at one time was like that of the largest rodent. (@ITNachalas Yaakov.@it See further in @ITGur Aryeh@it.) @p1[8]@p2<TIE>The other said, [he was actually the same king] but his edicts were new.@p3 Otherwise, [if it was a new king,] the verse should have said “@hh<HEB>וימת וימלוך@ee<ENG>, he [the king] died and a new king came into power.” [Rather it merely says @hh<HEB>ויקם@ee<ENG> (he arose).]<QC>
@d1He acted @BIas if@BO he did not know [him].@p3 The text of Rashi properly reads @hh<HEB>ואשר@ee<ENG> (@ITAnd@it he acted). Otherwise it would imply that Rashi’s explanation is according to both Rav @ITand@it Shmuel [who disagreed whether a new king arose], which is not so. Whereas “@ITAnd@it he acted” implies that it was the same king but he acted @ITas if@it he did not know Yoseif. @p1[10]@p2<TIE>To the nation [of Israel].@p3 The [singular] word @hh<HEB>לו@ee<ENG> (to him) refers to @hh<HEB>עם@ee<ENG> (nation), and not to [the plural] Bnei Yisrael. @d1Let us wisely determine what to do to him.@p3 [Rashi adds the words @hh<HEB>מה לעשות@ee<ENG> (what to do) in order] to say that the Egyptians did not try to be wiser than the nation. Rather, to deal wisely with the nation. For if the Egyptians tried to be wiser than the nation, it should have said @hh<HEB>נתחכם עליו@ee<ENG> (become wise “over” him), so why does it actually say @hh<HEB>לו@ee<ENG> (“with” him)? Therefore Rashi explains: “[To wisely determine] @ITwhat to do@it to him.” (@ITMaharshal@it) @d1Let us deal shrewdly with the Savior of Yisrael (God).@p3 According to this view, the word @hh<HEB>לו@ee<ENG> (with Him) is referring to Hashem [and not to the nation of Yisrael]. This explains the term @hh<HEB>רב ועצום@ee<ENG> (great and strong), and why the entire passage is written in the singular form. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @d1By bringing about their fate through water.@p3 If so, why did Pharaoh immediately order the midwives to kill any son that was born? [This act was not through water.] The answer is that this wise strategy was without the knowledge of the Egyptians. Rather, Pharaoh himself ordered the midwives [to kill the sons], and he did not fear Divine retribution because the midwives, not he, would actually carry it out. @d1For He has already sworn that He will never again bring a flood upon the world.@p3 Hashem exacts justice only in a manner of measure-for-measure. @p1[11]@p2<TIE>[The burdens] of the Egyptians.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: It should have said to oppress @IThim@it with @IThis@it burden, or to oppress @ITthem@it with @ITtheir@it burdens. [Instead of to oppress @IThim@it with @ITtheir@it burdens.] @d1They strengthened and fortified them.@p3 [If Bnei Yisrael built new cities] then the verse should have written @hh<HEB>ויבן את פיתום ואת רעמסס לערי מסכנות@ee<ENG> (And they built Pisom and Ramseis for supply cities). Since it is written “@hh<HEB>ויבן ערי מסכנות@ee<ENG> (And they built supply cities),” this implies that Pisom and Ramseis already existed and Bnei Yisrael only strengthened them. (@ITRe”m)@it<QC>
@p1[12]@p2<TIE>To the extent that they set their hearts to oppress [them].@p3 Rashi is answering the question: The verse implies that Bnei Yisrael increased because the Egyptians oppressed them. Would they not have increased otherwise? A further question: oppression @ITdecreases@it a population’s growth. Rashi answers: “To the extent that they @ITset their hearts@it.<TIE>.<TIE>.” In other words, the Egyptians did not actually oppress them [at this point]. Rather, they intended to do so. @d1So they are increasing and becoming strong.@p3 Since @hh<HEB>כן ירבה@ee<ENG> (lit. “so they @ITwill@it increase”) is referring to Hashem’s intent [to increase them], and He desires that Bnei Yisrael should constantly increase, why does the verse say @hh<HEB>ירבה@ee<ENG> in the future tense, [implying that it did not take place now]? Therefore Rashi explained it as @hh<HEB>כן רבה וכן פרץ@ee<ENG> (they are increasing and becoming strong), which indicates that is was ongoing. @d1Their lives became abhorrent to them.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: it says the Egyptians came to loathe, @hh<HEB>מפני בני ישראל@ee<ENG> (lit. @ITin the presence of@it Bnei Yisrael). Yet Bnei Yisrael were not with the Egyptians all the time. They were in the land of Goshen far from Pharaoh and his people. Therefore Rashi explains: The Egyptians’ own lives became abhorrent to them when Bnei Yisrael were mentioned. I would rather say Rashi inferred it from the verse’s use of @hh<HEB>מפני@ee<ENG> (because of) instead of simply saying @hh<HEB>ויקוצו בבני ישראל@ee<ENG>, “They came to loathe the Bnei Yisrael.” (@ITMaharshal@it)<QC>
@p1[15]@p2<TIE>It sometimes comes in the @HB<HEB>קל@BO<ENG> (light) conjugation<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 @hh<HEB>מְיַלְּדוֹת@ee<ENG> (delivering births) is considered the @hh<HEB>כבד@ee<ENG> (heavy) conjugation since there is a dagesh in the @hh<HEB>ל@ee<ENG>. @hh<HEB>מוֹלִידוֹת@ee<ENG> [which means the same] is considered the @hh<HEB>קל@ee<ENG> (light) conjugation since there is no dagesh in the @hh<HEB>ל@ee<ENG>. The same is true of the words @hh<HEB>שוֹבֵר@ee<ENG> (break) and @hh<HEB>מְשַׁבֵּר@ee<ENG>, @hh<HEB>דוֹבֵר@ee<ENG> (talk) and @hh<HEB>מְדַבֵּר@ee<ENG>. @hh<HEB>שׁוֹבֵר@ee<ENG> is in the @hh<HEB>קל@ee<ENG> conjugation, whereas @hh<HEB>מְשַבֵּר@ee<ENG> is in the @hh<HEB>כבד@ee<ENG> conjugation, yet their meaning is basically the same. The same is true of @hh<HEB>דוֹבֵר@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>מְדַבֵּר@ee<ENG>.<QC>
@d1This is Yocheved.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 It is written nearby (v. 21) that Hashem gave Houses to the midwives, which Rashi there explains as “Houses [i.e. families] of the Kohanim and the Levites and Royalty.” And we do not find that these families came from another woman, rather from Yocheved and Miriam. Therefore Shifra must be Yocheved, for she was Miriam’s mother — as it is not logical to write first the daughter and then the mother. [It follows that] Puah is Miriam. @p1[16]@p2<TIE>Only in regard to the male children because his astrologers.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 We might suggest that Pharaoh’s decree was to prevent Bnei Yisrael from multiplying [and not because of his astrologers]. However, then Pharaoh should have killed the females. For if Pharaoh kills the males and leaves the females, as long as one male remains he could impregnate many females. (@ITRe”m@it) But it seems to me [to explain Rashi otherwise]: If Pharaoh’s decree was only to prevent Bnei Yisrael from multiplying, why did he innovate the decree pertaining to the midwives? He was concerned about them multiplying because of “he will join our enemies and fight against us,” and this problem was removed by the decree of [appointing] the conscription officers. Rather, this new decree was “Because his astrologers.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) See further elaboration there. @d1And she will live (@HB<HEB>וְתִחְיֶה@BO<ENG>).@p3 Rashi is answering the question that @hh<HEB>וְחָיָה@ee<ENG> (lit. “and he will live”) is in the masculine form, as is seen in many places, [and thus it does not fit the subject (girl) of the verse]. But this @hh<HEB>וְחָיָה@ee<ENG> is in the feminine form, and is like the term @hh<HEB>וְתִחְיֶה@ee<ENG>. For there is a difference. The word in our verse has the accent on the next-to-last syllable, on the @hh<HEB>ח@ee<ENG>, thus it is in the feminine form. But when the accent is on the last syllable, on the @hh<HEB>י@ee<ENG>, it is in the masculine form. We find [examples of the masculine form] in Megillas Esther (4:11) where it is written: @hh<HEB>אֶת שַׁרְבִיט הַזָּהָב וְחָיָה@ee<ENG> [the accent is on the @hh<HEB>י@ee<ENG>]. And the same is in Koheles (6:6): @hh<HEB>וְאִלּוּ חָיָה אֶלֶף שָׁנִים@ee<ENG>. Another explanation: [Rashi is emphasizing that] since the letter @hh<HEB>ו@ee<ENG> begins the word @hh<HEB>וְחָיָה@ee<ENG>, this switches it to the future tense. @p1[17]@p2<TIE>They provided water and food for them.@p3 When it says “And did not do as the Egyptian king had told them,” we infer that the midwives did not kill them. So what does “they kept the infant boys alive” teach? That “they provided water and food.<TIE>.<TIE>.”<QC>
@d1This word @HB<HEB>וַתְּחַיֶיo@BO<ENG> and any form thereof is used to mean: “they” (fem.) did something, as well as: “you” (fem. pl.) did something.@p3 In other words, there is no difference [in spelling or nikud] between the third person plural feminine and the second person plural feminine, in the future tense [which here is switched to the past by the @hh<HEB>ו@ee<ENG>]. (@ITRe”m@it) It seems that Rashi offers the above explanation because he is answering the question: Since we explained the first “@hh<HEB>וַתְּחַיֶיo@ee<ENG> (they kept.<TIE>.<TIE>. alive)” as providing water and food, the Targum is difficult to understand. It translated the first “@hh<HEB>וַתְּחַיֶיo@ee<ENG> as @hh<HEB>וְקַיָימָא@ee<ENG> (they kept alive),” yet the second (v. 18) as @hh<HEB>וְקַיֵימְתּוּן@ee<ENG>. Why the switch? Otherwise we could have said that @hh<HEB>וְקַיֵימְתּוּן@ee<ENG> means they provided water and food, and for this reason the translation differs. But according to our explanation that the first @hh<HEB>וַתְּחַיֶיo@ee<ENG> means providing water and food, why did the Targum translate it as @hh<HEB>וְקַיָימָא@ee<ENG>? Therefore Rashi explains: “This is because, in Hebrew.<TIE>.<TIE>.” [Therefore the Targum translated the verbs according to their relative subjects]. @d1You [women] have spoken, @HB<HEB>וַתְּדַבֵּרְנָה@BO<ENG>, is the same as @HB<HEB>דִבַּרְתֶּן@BO<ENG>.@p3 Just as we find @hh<HEB>וַתּאמַרְנָה@ee<ENG> (third person, plural feminine) in one place, and @hh<HEB>וַתְּדַבֵּרְנָה@ee<ENG> in another, and this [second] word is like @hh<HEB>וַתּאמַרְנָה@ee<ENG>, with the same conjugation — yet it means the same as @hh<HEB>דִבַּרְתֶּן@ee<ENG>, which is second person. Here as well, the first @hh<HEB>וַתְּחַיֶיo@ee<ENG> is third person, while the second @hh<HEB>וַתְּחַיֶין@ee<ENG> is second person, although they has the same conjugation.<QC>
@p1[19]@p2<TIE>They may be compared to animals of the field.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi offers this explanation because of] a difficulty with the first explanation: Even if they were as knowledgeable as midwives, but a midwife also requires a midwife to deliver her. (@ITRe”m)@it @d1What a lioness is your mother!@p3 In other words, the verse compares the congregation of Israel (“your mother”) to a lioness. @p1[20]@p2<TIE>When it speaks in terms of “he did.”@p3 Meaning: he himself underwent the action [i.e. a transitive verb].<QC>
@d1Do not reject my [explanation] because of the words @HB<HEB>וילך@BO<ENG>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 These words [seem problematic because they] also are vocalized with a @hh<HEB>צירי@ee<ENG> yet they mean that he himself underwent the action. @d1Houses of Kohanim and the Levites .<TIE>.<TIE>. @hh<HEB>וייטב@ee<ENG> [Rashi is explaining that] “He was good,” and “he gave them houses” are not two separate points, [as Rashi preceded this by saying: “What was this good?”] @p1[22]@p2<TIE>Also upon them (the Egyptians) did he issue the decree.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 People ask: if they threw the infants into water because of what the astrologers said, what was their wisdom in “Come let us deal @ITwisely @itwith him” (Shemos 1:10), on this Rashi explains: “Let us .<TIE>.<TIE>. bring about their fate through water, for He has already sworn.<TIE>.<TIE>.”? The answer is: Originally, Pharaoh issued the decree only upon the Hebrews. “Come let us deal wisely,” refers to that decree. But Pharaoh issued an additional decree upon the Egyptians, on the day that Moshe was born. Only on that day @ITall@it male infants were thrown into the river, since the astrologers said their savior will be smitten through water, “but we do not know whether he is from the Egyptians or the Hebrews.” @p1[1]@p2<TIE>Married her a second time.@p3 [The proof:] immediately after this marriage, Yocheved conceived and gave birth to Moshe. Yet, Aharon and Miriam were older than Moshe. Therefore, they were born from the first marriage of Amram and Yocheved’s first marriage. @d1She, too, became youthful again. @p3Since Yocheved is described as @hh<HEB>בת@ee<ENG> @hh<HEB>לוי@ee<ENG> (lit. “girl of Levi”), this implies she was youthful.<QC>
@p1[2]@p2<TIE>When he was born the entire house was filled with light.@p3 Here it says @hh<HEB>כי טוב@ee<ENG> (he was good), and earlier (Bereishis 1:4) it says @hh<HEB>וירא אלהים את האור @bHכי טוב@BH@ee<ENG> (And Elokim saw the light, @ITthat@it @ITit was good@it). Just as @hh<HEB>כי טוב@ee<ENG> earlier refers to light, so too here it refers to light. @p1[3]@p2<TIE>One who gives birth in the seventh month can give birth to a live child, even though the seven months are incomplete, and are only six months and one day. @d1Tar on the outside.<TIE>.<TIE>. so that the righteous [child] should not have to smell.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi added a reason in Parshas Noach (Bereishis 6:14): “With Moshe’s box, since the water current was mild, it was sufficient to have [just] clay on the inside and on the outside.” See [Rashi] there. @p1[5]@p2<TIE>They were going to die because they opposed her (Pharaoh’s daughter).”@p3 The maids opposed her rescue of Moshe.<QC>
@d1Her handmaiden.@p3 Rashi said above: “Our Sages explained” [that the maids died.] For the angel Gavriel killed all the maids who accompanied Pharaoh’s daughter. If so, [how could she now send a maid to fetch the box?] The Gemara (Sotah 12b) already answered that Gavriel did not kill all her maids. He spared one maid, to extend honor to royalty, so that Pharaoh’s daughter would not be left alone. This remaining maid was sent. @d1But the Sages explained it as “hand” .<TIE>.<TIE>. and her arm extended many cubits<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 The verse should have said, “(She sent) @hh<HEB>נערתה@ee<ENG> or @hh<HEB>שפחתה@ee<ENG>” if it simply meant handmaidens. Because it did not sprecifically state @hh<HEB>ידה@ee<ENG>, the Sages explained @hh<HEB>אמתה@ee<ENG> as implying that her arm extended many @hh<HEB>אמות@ee<ENG> (cubits). Alternatively, the Sages explained this because the @hh<HEB>מ@ee<ENG> [of @hh<HEB>אמתה@ee<ENG>] has no dagesh [although the word @hh<HEB>אמה@ee<ENG> (hand or arm) requires one]. And the dagesh in nouns does not change even in the @ITnismach@it form, or with a possessive suffix [such as @hh<HEB>תה@ee<ENG> as it appears here]. Yet the word did change here, for the @hh<HEB>א@ee<ENG> has a sheva [i.e., a chataf patach, due to which the dagesh in the @hh<HEB>מ@ee<ENG> drops out], although the @hh<HEB>א@ee<ENG> should have had a [simple] patach. [Therefore our Sages explain: The word @hh<HEB>אמתה@ee<ENG> changed, to indicate that the arm of Pharaoh’s daughter changed.] (@ITGur Aryeh@it). @p1[6]@p2<TIE>She saw the Divine Presence with him.@p3 If [the verse means that]she saw Moshe, it should have stated @hh<HEB>ותראה@ee<ENG> (she saw). Therefore, the letter @hh<HEB>ו@ee<ENG> at the end of the word @hh<HEB>ותראהו@ee<ENG> refers to the Divine Presence, [Whom she saw with the child].<QC>
@d1His voice was like that of a [grown] boy.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Why is he called a @hh<HEB>נער@ee<ENG> (grown boy)? This implies thirteen years old, but Moshe was not this age. @p1[9]@p2<TIE>She unknowingly prophesied.@p3 Although @hh<HEB>הֵא@ee<ENG> [i.e., the first half of @hh<HEB>הֵיליכי@ee<ENG>] is normal usage of the language, as in (Bereishis 42:23) @hh<HEB>הֵא לכם זרע@ee<ENG> (here is seed for you), [Rashi offers his Midrashic explanation] only because @hh<HEB>ליכי@ee<ENG> is written instead of @hh<HEB>לָךְ@ee<ENG>. Although @hh<HEB>ליכי@ee<ENG> is feminine [and is thus fitting for the verse], but @hh<HEB>לָךְ@ee<ENG> also refers to females. For example [Elkanah speaking to Chanah]: @hh<HEB>אנכי טוב לָךְ@ee<ENG> (I have been good to you). (Shmuel I, 1:8) @p1[10]@p2<TIE>As one who extracts a hair from milk. @hh<HEB>כמשחל בניתא מחלבא@ee<ENG> is Aramaic for “taking a hair out of the milk.”<QC>
@p1[11]@p2<TIE>He was one of the slave drivers.@p3 Since the beating [that the Egyptian did] is juxtaposed to the burdens of hard labor, they are related. Therefore Rashi explains: “He was one of the slave drivers.” @d1He would wake them at the crow of the rooster to their tasks.@p3 When the rooster crowed, they immediately needed to get up for their work. @d1He was beating and terrorizing him.@p3 We need not ask how Rashi knew that @hh<HEB>מכה@ee<ENG> means only beating rather than smiting and killing. For the answer is [clear]: Rashi explains later that Moshe killed the Egyptian only after seeing that there was no good man destined to descend from him. Otherwise Moshe would not have killed him. Whereas if @hh<HEB>מכה@ee<ENG> means kill, why did Moshe need to see this? Even if the Egyptian would have good descendants he would deserve death for murdering a Hebrew, as Scripture states (Shemos 21:23), “A soul for a soul.” Thus, @hh<HEB>מכה@ee<ENG> must mean beating and terrorizing but not killing. That is why Moshe needed to see if there would be any good descendant—otherwise he would not kill him since he was not liable for death by Torah law. You might then ask: how was Moshe allowed to kill him, [if he was not liable for death by Torah law]? The answer is that B’nei Noach are liable for death for violating any Noachite law. And they are commanded against beating, just as Jews are. Nevertheless, were he destined to have a good descendant, Moshe would have judged the Egyptian by Torah law rather than by Noachite law. @d1He (the victim) was the husband of Shlomis, daughter of Divri.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because of what is written later in Parshas Emor: “Shlomis daughter of Divri” (Vayikra 24:11). There Rashi explained: “It is praiseworthy to the Jews that Shlomis is specified, as this means only she had illicit relations.” And if this woman was not Shlomis, then there would be two Jewish women who had illicit relations. @d1He (the Egyptian) was attracted to her .<TIE>.<TIE>. and came upon his wife.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because otherwise Moshe would not have killed him. The Egyptian would not deserve death for only beating the Hebrew. Therefore, he must have come upon his wife and definitely deserved death since adultery is forbidden by the seven Noachite laws, as it is written (Bereishis 2:24): “And he shall cleave to his wife” [and not to another’s wife; see @ITYerushalmi, Kiddushin @it1:1]. This also answers the question posed above (How was Moshe allowed to kill him?). @p1[12]@p2<TIE>No man was there .<TIE>.<TIE>. that would convert.@p3 [Rashi offers this Midrashic interpretation] because the verse says “he saw that no @hh<HEB>איש@ee<ENG> (man) was there,” rather than “no @hh<HEB>אדם@ee<ENG> (person) was there.” Whereas according to the verse’s plain meaning that Moshe was afraid of being seen, there is no difference whether it was a man or a woman. Therefore Rashi explains, “No man.<TIE>.<TIE>. that would convert,” since @hh<HEB>איש@ee<ENG> implies a tzaddik. Similarly Rashi explains in Parshas Shelach (Bamidbar 13:3) and in Parshas Devarim (Devarim 1:13) that @hh<HEB>איש@ee<ENG> implies a tzaddik but it does not exclude women (@ITMaharamash)@it. You might ask that in Parshas Emor (Vayikra 24:10), Rashi says that @hh<HEB>בתוך בני ישראל@ee<ENG> (among the B’nei Yisrael) means that the son whom the Egyptian begat from Shlomis had converted. [Thus, he did have a righteous descendant.] The answer is that when Moshe killed the Egyptian, Shlomis had already conceived him. However, Moshe saw that no additional converts were destined to descend from him. @p1[13]@p2<TIE>Dosson and Avirom.@p3 [Rashi knows it was them] because the verse here states “Two @hh<HEB>אנשים@ee<ENG> (men),” similar to what is written there [about Dosson and Avirom]: “Move away from the tents of these evil @hh<HEB>אנשים@ee<ENG> (men)” (Bamidbar 16:26). @d1Though he had not yet struck him.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because the verse should have said @hh<HEB>למה אתה מכה@ee<ENG> (“why are you beating,” in the present tense), as it did above: @hh<HEB>מכה איש עברי מאחיו@ee<ENG> (beating one of his Hebrew brethren). Thus, @hh<HEB>למה תכה@ee<ENG> (“why will you beat,” in the future tense) means “why @ITdo you wish@it to strike your friend?” @d1He is as wicked as you.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: why did Moshe call him @hh<HEB>רעך@ee<ENG> (your friend), if one was wicked and the other not? Therefore Rashi explains that also his friend was wicked (@ITMaharshal@it). @p1[14]@p2<TIE>He killed [the Egyptian] with the Divine Name.@p3 [Rashi knows this] since the verse states @hh<HEB>הלהרגני אתה אומר@ee<ENG> (Are you @ITsaying@it to kill me), rather than @hh<HEB>הלהרגני אתה מבקש@ee<ENG> (Are you @ITplanning@it to kill me). This shows that Moshe killed him through speech. Who told him that the Egyptian was killed by the Divine Name? We could say [that the wicked man knew how Moshe killed the Egyptian] since he saw that Moshe buried him in the sand but he did not see Moshe lift a hand against him. Thus he deduced that Moshe killed him with the Divine Name (@ITRe”m)@it. @d1Wicked people who were informers.@p3 The word @hh<HEB>דלטורין@ee<ENG> means “informers.” @d1To be subjugated by oppressive work.@p3 Although there had been a decree upon the descendants of Avraham: “And they will enslave them and afflict them four hundred years” (Bereishis 15:13), nevertheless, Moshe questioned [Why they were oppressed], since it is written (Devarim 24:16): “Children shall not die for [the sins of] their fathers.” Alternatively, [Moshe’s question was that] Avraham and Yitzchak had other descendants, so why was subjugation not decreed upon them. Alternatively, although “they will enslave them and afflict them” had been decreed, but oppressive work had not decreed upon them. And this [i.e., their oppressive work] is what puzzled Moshe (@ITMaharma”i@it). @p1[15]@p2<TIE>They (Dosson and Avirom) informed on him.@p3 [Rashi knows this because] it says later on (Shemos 4:19): “For they have died — all the men who had sought your life.” This was Dosson and Avirom, as we see in Maseches Nedarim 64b. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1[16]@p2<TIE>He abandoned the worship of idols whereupon they (the Midianites) banished him.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Since Yisro was the most prominent man of Midian, why did the shepherds chase away his sheep? Therefore Rashi explains: “He abandoned the worship of idols.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (@ITMaharshal@it) Although Yisro abandoned the worship of idols, he did not convert fully. For later, upon hearing of the Splitting of the Sea, he came to convert. But I heard it means that Yisro abandoned the idols of Midian to worship other idols. This is in accordance with the Mechilta (Yisro 1): “There was no idol that Yisro had not worshipped.” Thus we must say that Yisro abandoned one idolatry for another. According to this, we can understand why Yisro stipulated with Moshe that Moshe’s first son shall be devoted to idolatry (ibid.), [although Yisro had already “abandoned” the worship of idols]. (@ITMaharamash@it)<QC>
@p1[20]@p2<TIE>For whom the waters [of the Nile] rose.@p3 It seems that Rashi inferred this from the fact that Yisro asked his daughters: “How did you get to come [home] so early today?” It is difficult to understand the basis of his question. If he knew that the shepherds came every day and chased the sheep away, they would not go in the first place before the shepherds finished watering. And if he knew that the shepherds did @ITnot@it come first every day, [why was he surprised his daughters returned early?] Perhaps the shepherds did not come [first] today. Thus we must assume that on that day Yisro’s daughters returned home so early that even if the shepherds did @ITnot@it come first, the daughters would not have returned so soon. Therefore he asked them: “How did you get to come [home] so early today?” And they answered that a man came and drew for them, and the water rose up for him, thus they did not need to draw. And how did Rashi know that they answered so? Because the verse stated previously: “To draw water and @ITfill the troughs@it,” implying that the daughters would pour water into the troughs to water their sheep. Whereas they now said to Yisro: “He also drew for us, and watered the sheep,” implying that Moshe did not pour the water into the troughs but watered the sheep straight from the well. Since he did not need to pour, the water must have risen up for him (@ITMaharshal@it). (There are new insights to be formulated here, but time does not permit.) @d1Perhaps he might marry one of you.@p3 Rashi [offers this Midrashic explanation in answer to] the question: Why did Yisro say “let him eat bread”? Is it proper that Yisro honor Moshe merely with bread, in return for his great kindness? It would be understandable [for Yisro to say so] if Moshe was present. Then we could assume that Yisro was saying little and doing much, as the Gemara (Bava Metzia 87a) states regarding Avraham’s statement, “I will bring some bread [for the guests to eat]” (Bereishis 18:5). However, Avraham was a tzaddik, and the tzaddikim say little and do much, but Yisro was not as righteous and Moshe was not present so Yisro would not say this, for even Avraham made his statement when the angels @ITwere@it present. Furthermore, the verse implies that Moshe was invited only for eating bread, and then he would go on his way. Was Yisro’s great concern justified for this [i.e., eatng bread] alone, that he should exclaim: “Why did you abandon the man? Call him<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”? Therefore Rashi explains, “Perhaps he might marry one of you.” This also explains the verse following, “Moshe agreed to reside with the man<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.,” i.e., Moshe agreed to remain with Yisro because of “.<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>and he gave Moshe his daughter Tzipporah.” The word @hh<HEB>ויואל@ee<ENG> (agreed) clearly implies that Yisro requested this of him, and now Moshe agreed to fill his request. Therefore, we must say that this request is hinted in “Call him and let him eat bread,” meaning: “perhaps he might marry one of you.” That is why Yisro sent after Moshe (@ITMaharamash@it). @p1[21]@p2<TIE>I have agreed to speak (@HB<HEB>הואלתי לדבר@BO<ENG>).@p3 We must say that Rashi is bringing his proof [that @hh<HEB>ויואל@ee<ENG> means “I have agreed”] from the second instance that @hh<HEB>הואלתי@ee<ENG> appears in Parshas Vayeira (Bereishis 18:31). For @hh<HEB>הואלתי@ee<ENG> appears there twice, and the first @hh<HEB>הואלתי@ee<ENG> (ibid v. 27) does not mean “I have agreed,” rather “I have begun,” as Rashi explains there.<QC>
@p1[23]@p2<TIE>He was stricken with leprosy<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 If the verse means that he actually died, why did B’nei Yisrael cry? Perhaps the king to reign after Pharaoh will be benevolent. Perforce we must conclude that he was stricken with leprosy, and a leper is considered as dead (Nedarim 64b).<QC>
@p1[5]@p2<TIE>The place.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: @hh<HEB>אדמת@ee<ENG> (ground) is feminine, but @hh<HEB>הוּא@ee<ENG> [the pronoun ostensibly referring to it] is masculine. Therefore Rashi explains that @hh<HEB>הוּא@ee<ENG> refers to @hh<HEB>המקום@ee<ENG> (the place).<QC>
@p1[10]@p2<TIE>You will bring My nation out.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: The verse should have said “Go, I am sending you to Pharaoh @hh<HEB>להוציא@ee<ENG> (to bring out),” whereas @hh<HEB>והוצא@ee<ENG> (and you will bring out) implies that it is a separate statement. Therefore Rashi inserts @hh<HEB>ואם תאמר@ee<ENG> (should you say<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.) to which the answer is: “and you will bring out<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (i.e., that it is one statement). @p1[11]@p2<TIE>Who am I.@p3 The word “who” [am I] is used in place of “what” [am I] because it is not possible to explain this statement as referring to “bringing them out,” for the verse continues “Am I able to bring the Bnei Yisroel out.” Perhaps Moshe felt inadequate to speak with Pharaoh for he was a king. Thus Rashi comments “that I might speak with kings.” @d1What did the Israelites do to merit<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knew this] because Hashem responded, “When you bring the people out [to receive the Torah].” This implies that Moshe asked this (i.e., what did.the Israelites do to merit<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.)<QC>
@p1[12]@p2<TIE>And the vision that you saw in the thornbush<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi explains: Do not think that the burning bush was just an illusion. Rather, it was a true sign from Hashem. @d1You, too, shall go on My mission and you will not be harmed.@p3 Otherwise, @hh<HEB>לך@ee<ENG> (to you) is superfluous in the verse. Therefore, [Hashem tells Moshe that] it is a sign to you, Moshe, that you will not be harmed, just as you saw the bush was not being consumed. @d1Three months after they go out of Egypt.@p3 If you ask: When does the count start? [For it cannot start] from this Divine statement, as the ten plagues came in between, and each plague lasted for a quarter month, and the other three quarters [of the month] Moshe would caution and warn them, as Rashi explains in Parshas Va’eira (Shemos 7:25), on “Seven full days [passed].” Thus, the plagues lasted for a ten month period. Furthermore, the plagues did not begin immediately after this Divine statement. And if [you suggest that] the count begins with the exodus from Egypt, this is less than a two month period: half of Nisan, Iyar, and on the sixth of Sivan they received the Torah. The answer is: The promise of receiving the Torah is not speaking exclusively of the Written Torah, but also of the Oral Torah. After they received the [Written] Torah, Moshe ascended Mount Sinai. He was there forty days and nights, and received the Oral Torah. When he descended on the 17th of Tammuz, it was three full months [from the exodus]. And the B’nei Yisrael were redeemed in order [to receive] the Oral Torah. As it is written (ibid., 34:27): “@hh<HEB>על פי הדברים האלה כרתי אתך ברית@ee<ENG> (for with these words, I have made a covenant with you),” and @hh<HEB>על פי@ee<ENG> [lit. “by the mouth of”] alluding to the Oral Torah. An alternative answer: “Three months after [they go out of Egypt]” means “@ITin@it the third month [following their exodus from Egypt].” As Rashi similarly explains (Shemos 19:15): “@hh<HEB>לשלשת ימים@ee<ENG> (for three days)” as meaning @ITon@it the third day. @d1And this will be a sign to you.@p3 Rashi is proving that Hashem makes a promise which is contingent to a previous promise, although that first promise has not as yet been fulfilled. The same is true here. The promise of Moshe’s mission [to bring the people out] has not as yet been realized. [You might ask:] how can that [promise] serve as a proof [of the fulfillment] of a further promise — the receiving of the Torah? [Thus Rashi answers:] We find a similar sentence structure in Yeshayahu regarding the promise of Sancheriv’s downfall, which had not yet happened. Yet it signaled [the fulfillment of] another promise — namely, that which grows of itself will be blessed.<QC>
@p1[15]@p2<TIE>So that it (My Name) not be read as written.@p3 The @ITRe”m’s@it lengthy commentary is expressed in the Gemara (Pesachim 50a), and he [apparently] overlooked it. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it).<QC>
@p1[18]@p2<TIE>Through Yaakov and Yoseif.@p3 You might ask: If so, Moshe also knew the expression, as they did. So how is [his using] it a proof? Perhaps Moshe was lying [that Hashem sent him]! The answer is: Moshe was only twelve [when he fled from Egypt], and this sign was transmitted only to adults. @d1Elokim will surely consider you.@p3 This is puzzling: we do not find such a verse said by Yaakov. Perhaps the answer is: this verse is said twice by Yoseif (Bereishis 50:24, 25), thus Yoseif said one on his own accord, and one he said in the name of his father Yaakov, i.e., Yoseif received [this expression] from his father. (@ITRe”m@it) So it is written in Pirkei D’Rabbi Eliezer (ch. 48), in Tosafos (Sotah 13a), and in Shemos Rabbah (here and in ch. 5). (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it). @d1The word @HB<HEB>נקרה@BO<ENG> is derived from the term @HB<HEB>מקרה@BO<ENG> (happening).@p3 But in the beginning of Parshas Vayikra (1:1) Rashi wrote [that it means otherwise]: Hashem reveals Himself to prophets of the nations with a term [@hh<HEB>ויקר@ee<ENG>, similar to @hh<HEB>נקרה@ee<ENG>,] meaning impurity. Perhaps the answer is: @hh<HEB>ויקר@ee<ENG> [and @hh<HEB>נקרה@ee<ENG>] is always derived from @hh<HEB>מקרה@ee<ENG>, but sometimes it means a chance happening, such as (Devarim 22:6): “@hh<HEB>כי יקרא קן ציפור@ee<ENG> (if you @IThappen@it upon a bird’s nest).” And sometimes it means emission of a man’s seed, which denotes impurity, such as in (ibid., 23:11) “@hh<HEB>מקרה לילה@ee<ENG> (a @IThappening@it of night).” (@ITRe”m@it) @d1I [Bilaam] will be met by Him here (@HB<HEB>ואנכי אקרה כה@BO<ENG>).@p3 This @hh<HEB>אקרה@ee<ENG> does not imply that Bilaam happened to meet Hashem, since [on the contrary], Hashem met @IThim@it, [as it states,] @hh<HEB>ויקר אלהים אל בלעם@ee<ENG> (“Hashem happened to meet Bilaam”). Bilaam was not the one initiating; rather he was the one being met. Rashi explains @hh<HEB>כה@ee<ENG> to mean @hh<HEB>הלום@ee<ENG> (“here”), as in (Shemos 7:16): “Until here (@hh<HEB>כה@ee<ENG>) you have not listened.” This @hh<HEB>כה@ee<ENG> does not mean “thusly”, as in (Shemos 4:22), “Thusly (@hh<HEB>כה@ee<ENG>) said Adonoy.” For if this @hh<HEB>כה@ee<ENG> means “thusly,” then @hh<HEB>אקרה @ee<ENG>could imply: “I thusly will be met by another, just as Hashem met me.” But this is not the intent of this verse. (@ITRe”m@it) @p1[19]@p2<TIE>And not because his hand is strong.@p3 In other words, the verse means: “The king of Egypt will not allow you to go, but @ITnot@it because his hand is strong.” For [the next verse says:] “I will then send forth My hand and strike Egypt<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. [and then he (Pharaoh) will send you out.]” Whereas if Pharaoh’s hand was strong, he would not send them out [even after being struck]. @d1And not because his power is strong. @hh<HEB>ולא מן קדם דחיליה תקיף@ee<ENG> means “but not because he has great strength.” Rashi attributes the explanation to Rabbi Yaakov rather than to Onkelos only as regards the meaning of @hh<HEB>ושלחתי את ידי@hh@ee<ENG>, who explained it as, “for once I send forth My Hand and strike [Egypt]” he will immediately send you out. The @ITRe”m@it writes: “But [according to this,] I do not know how to explain the @hh<HEB>ו@ee<ENG> of @BH@hh<HEB>אחרי כן ישלח אתכם@ee<ENG> (@ITAnd@it then he will send you out).” It would seem the answer is: The @hh<HEB>ו@ee<ENG> is [superfluous] like the @hh<HEB>ו@ee<ENG> in (Bereishis 36:24): @hh<HEB>ואלה בני צבעון @hbו@hhאיה וענה@ee<ENG> (And these are the children of Tziv’on: @ITand@it Ayah and Anah). @p1[22]@p2<TIE>Menachem places it (@HB<HEB>ונצלתם@BO<ENG>) in the Machberes<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is explaining that Menachem categorizes @hh<HEB>ונצלתם@ee<ENG> (you will divest) with the words that have @hh<HEB>צ@ee<ENG> as the first letter of their root. Thus the root is @hh<HEB>צל@ee<ENG>, and the @hh<HEB>נ@ee<ENG> is not a root letter.<QC>
@d1Whereas, every letter @HB<HEB>נ@BO<ENG> which sometimes appears in a word<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is offering an additional proof that the @hh<HEB>נ@ee<ENG> of @hh<HEB>וינצלו@ee<ENG> [and of @hh<HEB>ונצלתם@ee<ENG>] is a root letter. @d1E.g. “@HB<HEB>ונשאתם@BO<ENG> (you shall carry) your father.”@p3 Surely the @hh<HEB>נ@ee<ENG> of @hh<HEB>נִצלתם@ee<ENG>, which sometimes is omitted entirely according to Menachem who says it is not a root letter, should be vocalized here with a [mere] @ITshva@it. Yet, it is vocalized with a @ITchirik.@it Thus Rashi concludes: “I, therefore, say .<TIE>.<TIE>. is part of the root.”<QC>
@p1[2]@p2<TIE>As a person who says to his friend.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 This does not contradict the Midrashic explanation [which preceded]. Rather, it explains why Hashem said: “What is that in your hand?” in the form of a question. For did Moshe not know what was in his hand? He surely saw it was a staff.<QC>
@p1[8]@p2<TIE>Once you tell them, “because of you I was struck [with @BItzora’as@BO]” .<TIE>.<TIE>. they will believe you.@p3 [Rashi offers this explanation because] otherwise the last sign is no better than the first.  [Rashi offers this explanation because] otherwise the last sign is no better than the first. The @ITRe”m@it asks: “But [according to this,] I do not know what Rashi would say regarding the sign of [water turning to] blood. How is it better than the two preceding signs?” It would seem the answer is: the B’nei Yisrael did not actually see the first two signs, thus they might not believe them. But the sign of blood they will see with their own eyes, therefore they will believe in it. And Moshe was not commanded to perform the first two signs [before them] because these signs served also to punish Moshe, as Rashi explained, [and it would not be proper to punish Moshe in front of them]. The @ITMaharshal@it explains [why the first two signs were not repeated]: For if we say the @ITtzora’as@it punished Moshe for slander, then he had received his [due amount of] suffering from Hashem the first time, and need not be afflicted with @ITtzora’as@it again. And if we say it was not because of Moshe’s sin, then surely Hashem would not make him suffer a second time for naught. @p1[9]@p2<TIE>They will not turn into blood until they reach the dry land.@p3 You might ask: But why is the first @hh<HEB>והיו@ee<ENG> needed? The answer is: It is the way of Scripture to begin [a phrase] with @hh<HEB>והיו@ee<ENG>. (@ITRe”m@it)<QC>
@p1[11]@p2<TIE>[And who made] his servants deaf.@p3 The @ITRe”m@it asks: If Pharaoh became dumb and exerted no effort to kill Moshe, why did Hashem also need to make his servants deaf and blind? The @ITRe”m@it answers: [Originally, Pharaoh spoke up and ordered Moshe’s death. And] after he heard of Moshe’s escape, he commanded his servants to give chase and capture him. It was then that all his servants became deaf. And when Pharaoh saw that Moshe was not captured, he thought they gave chase but did not find him. Thus Pharaoh did not exert any effort to send many more servants from all areas to find and capture Moshe and have him executed. Instead, he kept silent and went his way. @d1Is it not I, that My @BIName@bi is Adonoy, who did all this?@p3 [Rashi adds@IT“@itthat My@IT Name@it” to explain that] it does not mean “My essence is Adonoy.” For it is written (Shemos 6:3), “My Name Adonoy I did @ITnot@it make known to them.” The reason Rashi says, “@HB<HEB>ש@BO@hhשמי ה@ee<ENG> (@p3that@p3 My Name is Adonoy)” instead of simply “@hh<HEB>שמי ה'@ee<ENG> (My name is Adonoy),” is that it would otherwise mean Hashem is informing us of His Name, which is Adonoy. And if so, how does it relate back to [the beginning of the verse]: “Who gave man a mouth<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”? But with the added @hh<HEB>ש@ee<ENG> it means: “Who gave man a mouth? .<TIE>.<TIE>. It is I, that My Name is Adonoy.” Rashi’s further addition, “Who did all this?” refers back to “Who gave man a mouth<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1[13]@p2<TIE>Through the one You usually send, namely, Aharon.@p3 This raises a difficulty: Why did Moshe not expressly say: “Send Aharon”? Thus Rashi offers the alternate explanation. And the alternate explanation raises a difficulty: It is not plausible that Moshe would himself utter this bad matter. Thus the first explanation is needed, too. (@ITMaharshal@it)<QC>
@p1[14]@p2<TIE>The adornment of the breastplate.@p3 The word @hh<HEB>עדי@ee<ENG> means “ornament.” @p1[16]@p2<TIE>This is an indication.@p3 In other words, this verse is @ITone@it of the indicators. For Rashi has many other verses to prove that these words mean @hh<HEB>על@ee<ENG>, which denotes @hh<HEB>בשביל@ee<ENG> (for). [The proof here is that] if @hh<HEB>לך@ee<ENG> is to be taken literally, then it means that Aharon will speak @ITto@it Moshe. If so, what does “to the people,” which follows it, mean? Therefore it must mean “@ITfor@it you,” i.e., “in place of you.” @p1[19]@p2<TIE>But had become paupers.@p3 Although it is stated (Nedarim 64b): “Four [kinds of people] are considered as if dead: a poor man, a blind man, a metzora and someone without children,” [nevertheless, for the following reasons Rashi knew that] here, “died” certainly means poverty. We cannot say they became blind, for regarding Korach’s rebellion it is written (Bamidbar 16:14): “If you put those people’s [Dasan and Aviram’s] eyes out.” [This implies they could indeed see.] And we cannot say they were afflicted with tzoraas, for it says (Devarim 11:6) that they were “in the midst of the camp,” [and a metzora must dwell outside of the camp]. And we cannot say [they were afflicted with tzoraas or blindness at the time] but were healed when the Torah was given, because all the people’s blemishes returned after the sin of the Golden Calf (Bamidbar Rabbah 7:4). And we cannot say they were considered as if dead because they had no children. For why would Hashem tell Moshe to return to Egypt because of this? Would their lack of children cause the authorities not to accept their slander against Moshe. Rather, it surely must be that Dasan and Aviram [were considered as if dead] because they became paupers, and for that reason Pharaoh would not heed their words. (@ITRan@it in Nedarim 7a) @p1[20]@p2<TIE>“Earlier” or “later” are not exact in Scripture.@p3 [Rashi states that events are not always recorded chronologically. This answers the question:] it should have been written “Moshe took the rod” before “Moshe took his wife.” For Moshe did not take the rod in Egypt, rather in Midian.<QC>
@p1[24]@p2<TIE>Moshe.@p3 You might ask: perhaps @hh<HEB>ויהי@ee<ENG> (he was, or: it was) refers to an event rather than to a person, as in (Bereishis 14:1), “@hh<HEB>ויהי@ee<ENG> (@ITIt @itwas) in the days of Amrafel,” and (ibid., 15:17), “@hh<HEB>ויהי@ee<ENG> (@ITIt@it was) at sunset.” The answer is: since it says afterwards “@hh<HEB>ויפגשהו ה'@ee<ENG> (Adonoy confronted @IThim@it),” without stating who was confronted, we must say that @hh<HEB>ויהי@ee<ENG> refers to Moshe [and thus means: @IThe@it was]. @d1Because his first concern was his lodging.@p3 You might ask: Rashi himself explained earlier that [Moshe did not circumcise him] because traveling endangers the child during the first three days [following circumcision]. If so, why was Moshe punished, [as they were in the midst of traveling]? The answer is: Moshe was now at an inn that was a distance of one day’s travel to Egypt. Such a short journey would not hurt or endanger the child. (@ITRe”m@it) @d1The angel turned into a kind of snake.@p3 [Rashi knew this] because otherwise, how could Zipporah have known that it was because of the circumcision that the angel wanted to kill Moshe? We need not object: Perhaps the angel told her expressly that it was because of the circumcision? For the answer is that the verse later states: “@ITThen@it she said, ‘[You are] a bridegroom of blood [to me] because of the circumcision.’” This implies that Zipporah did not actually understand it until @ITthen@it. Whereas if the angel told her expressly, why did she not understand? @p1[26]@p2<TIE>She understood<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 You might ask: Rashi explained above (v. 24) that she understood why the angel came since it swallowed Moshe from his head to his thigh, etc. Yet here Rashi explains that [she understood it] since the angel withdrew from Moshe now. Also the @ITRe”m@it asked this, writing: “I do not understand Rashi’s intent<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” The @ITRe”m@it elaborated on this point, leaving the question unresolved. @d1Referring to the blood of the circumcision.@p3 Whereas according to Rashi’s explanation, @hh<HEB>דמים@ee<ENG> (blood) is an expression of death and murder.<QC>
@p1[1]@p2<TIE>They received their retribution at Sinai: “Moshe, alone, drew near<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”@p3 @ITRe”m @itwrote: “It is puzzling that Rashi here explains the verse from Shemos 24:2 as implying that ‘But they did not draw near’ refers only to the elders. This is not true, because the previous verse (24:1) states: ‘Ascend to Adonoy, you @ITand Aharon, Nadav, and Avihu@it, and seventy of the elders of Israel.’ Then is written, ‘Moshe, alone, drew near<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.’ Yet if Hashem turned everyone back as a punishment, what was Aharon’s sin? Similarly with Nadav and Avihu, who were not among the seventy elders. [What was their sin?]” @ITRe”m@it left the matter unresolved. But to me it seems not so problematic. For Rashi explains in Parashas Yisro (Shemos 19:24): “You [Moshe] will have your own designated area [when Hashem descends on Mt. Sinai], and also Aharon will have his own designated area, whereas the people may not break through their position at all.” Thus we see that the elders did not have their own designated area but stood among the people, and this was the punishment. And as for Nadav and Avihu, perhaps they stood in the same designated area as Aharon. (@ITKitzur Mizrachi@it)<QC>
@p1[4]@p2<TIE>And have @BIthoughts@BO of resting from the work.@p3 Rashi explains [as he does] because nowhere do we find Moshe and Aharon telling them to disengage from their work, or that they were commanded to do so.<QC>

Also, why were only the officers beaten and not the taskmasters? @p1[7]@p2<TIE>As you had been doing till now.@p3 I.e., [@hh<HEB>כתמול שלשום@ee<ENG> does not refer to] just the past two days. @hh<HEB>כתמול@ee<ENG> here means the same as in (Iyov 8:9), “We have been since @hh<HEB>תמול@ee<ENG> (yesterday) so we do not know,” [where it is to be understood figuratively]. Consequently, the word @hh<HEB>שלשום@ee<ENG> (“and the day before”) is unnecessary—since @hh<HEB>תמול@ee<ENG> includes everything in the past. Nevertheless, it says @hh<HEB>שלשום@ee<ENG> so we will not mistakenly think that this @hh<HEB>תמול@ee<ENG> follows its usual, [i.e., literal] meaning in Scripture.<QC>
@p1[9]@p2<TIE>It is impossible to say that “@HB<HEB>ואל ישעו@BO<ENG> (Let them not talk)” has the same meaning as: “Hashem (@HB<HEB>וישע@BO<ENG>) turned to Hevel.” @p3This raises a difficulty: Rashi explained the verse “Hashem (@hh<HEB>וישע@ee<ENG>) turned to Hevel” (Bereishis 4:4), that @hh<HEB>וישע@ee<ENG> has the same meaning as in “@hh<HEB>ואל ישעו@ee<ENG>” in our verse.  Nevertheless, there is a view that even “@hh<HEB>ואל ישעו@ee<ENG>” means “turn.” (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1[11]@p2<TIE>And you must go with zeal.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: How does “because your workload must not be reduced” provide a reason for the preceding “You must go get your own straw”? On the contrary: if they go get straw, their work will surely be reduced! Therefore Rashi explains “And you must go with zeal,” [i.e., quickly], for the reason that the verse provides: “because your workload must not be reduced.” @p1[13]@p2<TIE>Pressured.@p3 I.e., @hh<HEB>אצים@ee<ENG> does not mean speed.<QC>
@p1[14]@p2<TIE>Those officers that Pharaoh’s taskmasters appointed.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: @hh<HEB>אשר שמו עליהם נוגשי פרעה@ee<ENG> seems to imply that the officers of B’nei Yisrael appointed Pharaoh’s taskmasters over themselves. Therefore Rashi explains: “Those officers that @ITPharaoh’s taskmasters@it appointed.” @d1Because they would say to them<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Usually, @hh<HEB>לאמר@ee<ENG> (to say) or @hh<HEB>אמירה@ee<ENG> (saying), when following a term of @hh<HEB>דיבור@ee<ENG> (speaking), comes to specify what was spoken in general, . But here, @hh<HEB>לאמר@ee<ENG> cannot mean this, [since @hh<HEB>וידבר@ee<ENG> is not written]. And here, @hh<HEB>לאמר@ee<ENG> also cannot mean “say to others,” [as it sometimes does]. Therefore Rashi was forced to explain: “Why were they beaten? Because they would @ITsay@it to them<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @d1The taskmasters beat them.@p3 Rashi explains @hh<HEB>ויוכו@ee<ENG> (they were beaten by others) only after he provides the reason why they were beaten. [Although logically, Rashi should first explain that they were beaten, and then provide the reason why]. This is because the reason provided, “Why have you not completed .<TIE>.<TIE>. the quota,” is in fact not the reason [said by] the beaten party, rather it is the reason [said by] the beaters, i.e., the taskmasters. [This is problematic because the taskmasters are not actually the subject of the verse.] Therefore, Rashi needed to explain that @hh<HEB>למה ויוכו@ee<ENG> implies that they were recipients of an act, and thus it is the same as saying @hh<HEB>למה הכום@ee<ENG> (why did they [the taskmasters] beat them). [In this way the taskmasters become the subject of the verse, and the reason of “Why have you not completed.<TIE>.<TIE>. the quota” follows logically.] @p1[16]@p2<TIE>Make bricks to equal the earlier amount.@p3 Otherwise, why did the officers complain about making bricks? They could just reduce the set number of bricks. Rather, their complaint was over being required to produce the same amount as before. @d1This thing is the sin of your people.@p3 In other words, [with a patach it would mean]: it is the sin of the Egyptians’. @d1And this thing brings sin to your people.@p3 In other words, “It brings sin to the B’nei Yisrael [when they fail to fulfill the command].”<QC>
@p1[20]@p2<TIE> Some of the B’nei Yisrael<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 These were not from among the officers, for they were pious people (as explained earlier). (@ITRe”m)@it However, it seems to me that surely they were from among the officers [who had just cried out to Pharaoh], since the verse states, “as they were leaving Pharaoh.” And “they” cannot refer to Moshe and Aharon, for they were not with Pharaoh now. And so it says in Shemos Rabbah (5:20). (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it)<QC>
@p1[1]@p2<TIE>To the kings of the seven nations when I will bring them (Yisrael) to the Land. @p3You might ask: It seems that Hashem is hinting @ITnow@it to Moshe that he will not enter the Land. Yet later, in Parshas Beha’alosecha (Bamidbar 10:29), and it says, “@ITWe@it are traveling to the place,” Rashi himself explained that Moshe thought he would enter the Land. The answer is: He thought he would enter but would die before conquering the seven nations, as B’nei Yisrael fought a long time before conquering them. But a difficulty remains, for earlier, it says, “Please send the one You usually send” (Shemos 4:13), and Rashi explained: “I [Moshe] am not destined to bring them into the Land.” Thus, it clearly implies that Moshe knew he would not enter the Land. The answer is: Moshe thought he would not bring them into the land as their leader, but would still enter as one of the people. But a difficulty still remains: Later on in Parshas Beshalach, it says, “@ITYou @itwill bring them and plant them on the mountain of Your inheritance” (Shemos 15:17), and Rashi explains: “Moshe prophesied that he would not enter the Land [at all].” The answer is: Moshe surely prophesied this, but not as a full prophecy, i.e., he prophesied without realizing the content of his prophecy. @d1Due to My strong hand<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., we should not explain that Pharaoh will let them go by @IThis@it strong hand, as in “The Egyptians pressed the people to hurry them” (Shemos 12:33), because this point is stated in the @ITend@it of our verse (“and by [a] strong hand, he will drive them out from his land”).<QC>
@d1He will drive them out against their will.@p3 This seems to mean: Because of Hashem’s strong hand on Egypt, Pharaoh will drive the people out. But the @ITRe”m@it explains: Because of Pharaoh’s strong hand on the people, he will drive them out. However, his explanation is not correct. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it)<QC>
@p1[2]@p2<TIE>He spoke to him with severity.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi infers this since it is written @hh<HEB>אלהים@ee<ENG>, [a Name] which denotes Divine judgment. Alternatively, Rashi infers this since it is written @hh<HEB>וידבר@ee<ENG>, an expression which denotes harsh speech. (@ITRe’m@it) And we need not ask: In many verses it is written @hb<HEB>וידבר@hh ה אל משה לאמר@ee<ENG>, yet there it does not imply harshness. [Why then is it different here?] The answer is: Usually, after @hh<HEB>וידבר@ee<ENG> it is written @hh<HEB>לאמר@ee<ENG>, [which implies soft speech]. Thus @hh<HEB>וידבר@ee<ENG> is general (@ITklal@it), and @hh<HEB>לאמר@ee<ENG> is a specific (@ITprat@it) which tells us what is included in @hh<HEB>וידבר@ee<ENG>. But here there is no @hh<HEB>לאמר@ee<ENG> written afterward, since @hh<HEB>ויאמר אליו אני יהוה@ee<ENG> is not a @ITprat@it but an independent clause. It relates to what Moshe said [at the end of Parshas Shemos] — “Why did you send me?” — as Rashi here explains. [Alternatively,] it seems to me that [Rashi infers this since] it says afterward @hh<HEB>אני @hbיהוה@ee<ENG>, [a Name denoting Divine mercy,] which is the opposite [of the Name @hh<HEB>אלהים@ee<ENG> that the verse began with]. And that is why Rashi makes this comment here, and not in the other places. (@ITMaharshal@it) @d1It is not in vain that I sent you.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 In other words, Moshe said (5:22): “Why did you send me?” and Hashem answers him: “It is not in vain that I sent you”. (@ITRe’m@it) The @ITRe’m’@it’s words on this verse, [in which he also says that “Elohim spoke (harshly) to Moshe” refers back to Moshe’s question of “Why have you brought harm?”] are too lengthy to quote. However, it seems to me that this is not Hashem’s answer to what [Moshe said] before, in the way the @ITRe’m@it explained it. Rather, Rashi means to say as follows: Hashem spoke to Moshe with @hh<HEB>משפט@ee<ENG>, i.e., harshly and unpleasantly, because Moshe spoke harshly when he said “Why have You brought harm.<TIE>.<TIE>.?” [But Hashem’s harshness was not for this question itself,] as this is merely the beginning of [the more important phrase:] “.<TIE>.<TIE>.Why did you send me?” where Moshe was @ITconcerned over his own honor@it, as Rashi explained ad loc. [And @ITthat@it is why Hashem spoke harshly.] And when Rashi here explains, “It is not in vain that I sent you,” this also is not in answer to [Moshe’s question] which came before. Instead, [it is an independent point in which] Hashem is saying to Moshe, “Perhaps you think that you will not succeed in your mission? [This is not so;] it is not in vain that I sent you.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1[3]@p2<TIE>To the fathers.@p3 It is merely for brevity that Rashi says “to the fathers” rather than saying, as the verse does, “To Avraham, to Yitzchok, and to Yaakov.” (@ITRe’m@it) @p1@p2<TIE>I was not recognized by them by My attribute of keeping trust.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: In Parshas Lech Lecha (Bereishis 9:7) it is written @hh<HEB>אני @hbיהוה@hh וגו@ee<ENG>’ (“I am @ITAdonoy@it who took you out from Ur Casdim”). [If so, why does our verse imply that the fathers did not know the Name of Adonoy?] Therefore Rashi explains: “@hh<HEB>לא הודעתי@ee<ENG> is not written here.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1@p2<TIE>For I made promises but have not fulfilled them.@p3 Rashi is explaining the difference between @hh<HEB>יהוה@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>אל שדי@ee<ENG>. He therefore explains: “For I made promises but have not [as yet] fulfilled them” — in other words, “I did not yet fulfill My promise because they were not worthy of it.” If so, there is indeed a difference between [the two Names]. For a promise in the Name of @hh<HEB>יהוה@ee<ENG> is unconditional, [and it is fulfilled] even if they were to sin. @p1[4]@p2<TIE>Also when I revealed Myself to them as Almighty Shaddai.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: How does our verse’s wording, “I @ITalso@it,” fit in with what precedes it? It would be understandable if it had been written in the preceding verse: And My Name Adonoy I @ITdid@it make known to them. Then, “I @ITalso@it” would mean: I also did this for them, [to establish My covenant]. Or if it had been written in this verse: I also did @ITnot@it establish My covenant, it would be understandable — [as it would fit in with “I did @ITnot@it make known”]. But since it is written, “My Name Adonoy I did @ITnot@it make known to them,” what does “I @ITalso@it established” mean? Therefore Rashi explains, “Also when I revealed Myself.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Rashi means that Hashem says, so to speak, “Do not think that since I revealed Myself to them as Almighty Shaddai rather than as Adonoy, I do not need to fulfill My promise. This is not true, because I @ITalso@it set up and established a covenant with them. For these two reasons, Almighty Shaddai and the covenant, I need to fulfill My word that I promised them. This is because, [when combined,] they are as if I had promised them with the Name of Adonoy [which is unconditional]. According to this, the phrase “I @ITalso@it established My covenant” refers back to “I revealed Myself to Avraham.<TIE>.<TIE>. as Almighty Shaddai,” rather than referring to “but My Name Adonoy I did not make known to them.”<QC>
@d1I have made vows to them but have not fulfilled.@p3 In other words, [Rashi is saying that] from the verses he cited, we see that Hashem made vows to them. However, from these verses we do not see that Hashem has not fulfilled [those vows]. Without citing a proof [for that point,] Rashi is answering why Hashem sent Moshe, [in response to Moshe’s question at the end of Parshas Shemos. The answer is]: Since “I have not yet fulfilled those vows,” I must send you in order to fulfill My word to the Patriarchs. @p1[5]@p2<TIE>Just as I established and set up the covenant.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: What does “And @ITalso@it I have heard” mean? It implies that someone else heard, and also Hashem heard! Therefore Rashi explains, “Just as I established the covenant.<TIE>.<TIE>.” In other words, “@ITalso@it” refers back to the preceding. It is saying: Since I revealed Myself to them as Almighty Shaddai and established a covenant with them, and therefore I @ITalso@it must fulfill it, consequently, “I have heard.” [According to this,] “I have heard” is an independent clause, and it means: consequently I have heard. This section is to be understood as follows: At first, “Elohim spoke to Moshe” with severity because Moshe had said to Hashem, “Why have You brought harm to this people.<TIE>.<TIE>.?” Then, “.<TIE>.<TIE>.and said to him, ‘I am Hashem’,” refers back to what Moshe said, “Why did You send me?” Hashem is answering him, “I am Adonoy” and I can be trusted to keep My promise! [If so, how could] you ask, “Why did You send me”? And if you say: Why do I need to keep My promise, when it was made not by the Name Adonoy, rather by Almighty Shaddai — “but My Name Adonoy I did not make known to them”? However [this question is incorrect, because] “I also established My covenant,” therefore I also must fulfill it. For this reason, “I have heard.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @d1Therefore, I heard the groaning of the B’nei Yisrael, who groan<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is explaining] that it is impossible to fulfill the promise to give them Eretz Yisrael until after the exodus from Egypt, which itself requires the fulfillment of “And also, I will judge the nation to which they will be enslaved” (Bereishis 15:14). That is why the phrase, “That the Egyptians are enslaving them” is added to the verse — [thus indicating that the Egyptians must first be judged]. This is the meaning of, “And I have remembered My covenant.” It is saying: Since I have remembered the covenant of @ITbris bein habesarim,@it in which I promised to give them Eretz Yisrael, therefore I have remembered also, “I will judge the nation.<TIE>.<TIE>.” For both promises were made at the same time. This completes Hashem’s answer to [Moshe’s question]: “Why did You send me? Ever since I came to Pharaoh.<TIE>.<TIE>. he has done harm to this people.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (5: 22—23). [Hashem is answering: I cannot fulfill, “I will judge the nation” until I first harden Pharaoh’s heart and he does harm to B’nei Yisrael.] (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it; see elaboration there)<QC>
@p1[6]@p2<TIE>The trouble of the burden of Egypt.@p3 Here Rashi is answering the question: What does “under the burdens” mean? It implies that the burdens are [an actual physical object] spread on top of B’nei Yisrael, and Hashem is bringing them out from underneath. Therefore Rashi explains, “The @ITtrouble@it of the burden,” i.e., [it is a figure of speech and] B’nei Yisrael are like a person carrying a load, from under which he is brought out. Here too, Egyptian slavery is like a load on top of them, and Hashem, so to speak, is bringing them out from underneath it. But before (1:11) it said “burdens” without saying “under,” [thus prompting Rashi’s comment here].<QC>
@p1[8]@p2<TIE>To swear by My Throne.@p3 This is like saying, “To swear by My Kingship,” since a throne represents kingship, as [Pharaoh said to Yosef] in (Bereishis 41:40), “Only by [virtue of] the throne I will be greater than you.” (@ITGur Aryeh@it) @p1[9]@p2<TIE>They did not accept words of comfort.@p3 [Rashi is explaining that] here, @hh<HEB>שמעו@ee<ENG> means “accept.” They had given up hope of being redeemed, as they considered it impossible for them to be redeemed from such hard labor. Thus, “to Moshe” means, to Moshe’s words of comfort. @d1He is short of breath.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 The verse is saying, so to speak: They would not listen to Moshe because of their @ITgreat distress@it and hard labor. As a distressed person is normally short of breath, therefore it says “shortness of wind.”<QC>
@d1This is all the more so when it is a fulfillment of reward.@p3 In other words, Rabbi Baruch is bringing proof to what Rashi explained before, on the verse: “.<TIE>.<TIE>.and said to him, ‘I am @ITAdonoy’@it” (v. 2). There Rashi explained, “I can be trusted to properly reward.<TIE>.<TIE>.” [And Rabbi Baruch proves] that “even where punishment is involved, He lets it be known that His Name is Adonoy [a Name denoting Divine mercy]. This is all the more so when it is a fulfillment of reward,” since Hashem’s measure of giving reward is much greater than His measure of exacting punishment. @d1As referring to what is discussed earlier.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is saying that according to the Sages, the entire section beginning with “Elohim spoke to Moshe.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (v. 2) refers back to [Moshe’s question in the end of Parshas Shemos,] “Why have You brought harm?” Whereas according to Rashi, only the phrase “Elohim spoke to Moshe” relates to “Why have You brought harm” — while the rest of the section, starting from “.<TIE>.<TIE>.and said to him, “I am Adonoy” relates to “Why did you You send me?” as explained earlier. You might ask: Afterward the Sages explain that the section relates to [another question of Moshe:] “Should they ask, ‘what is His Name,’ what shall I tell them?” (Shemos 3:13). [So how can Rashi say that the Sages relate the whole section to “Why have You brought harm?”] The answer is: [“Elohim spoke to Moshe,” which teaches that] Hashem spoke with severity to Moshe, for both these questions. Rashi first said that the section relates to “Why have You brought harm.<TIE>.<TIE>.?” because that is the main factor that brought on all [of Hashem’s rebuke]. And while Hashem was rebuking Moshe for that, He also rebuked him for [his other question of] “Should they ask, ‘what is His Name?’” The proof is the fact that Hashem did not speak with severity to Moshe until he asked, “Why have You brought harm.<TIE>.<TIE>.?” Why did He not speak with severity right after Moshe said, “Should they ask, ‘what is His Name?’ what shall I say to them?” This shows that “Why have You brought harm.<TIE>.<TIE>.” was the cause for it all.<QC>
@d1What shall I tell them?@p3 It is difficult to understand [Rashi’s explanation of the Sages’ view. For we could object:] That is the very reason why Moshe needed to ask [Hashem’s Name], as he did not know any of Hashem’s Names — whereas Hashem revealed Himself to the Patriarchs many times. Why should they ask? A further difficulty is that Moshe did not ask for himself, rather for Yisrael. [He asked,] “What shall I tell @ITthem@it?” Thus it seems to me that the following is the explanation of [the Sages’ view as cited in] the Talmud and Shemos Rabba: Hashem did not make known to the Patriarchs the Name @hh<HEB>יהוה@ee<ENG>, which is Hashem’s great and true Name, only the Name @hh<HEB>אל שדי@ee<ENG>, which is a mere description [of His traits]. Nevertheless, the Patriarchs did not question Hashem’s ways. Even though the Name of Hashem was mad known to him, he asked, “What shall I tell them?” Even so, Moshe questioned Hashem’s ways. (@ITNachalas Yaakov;@it see explanation there) @d1And when Avraham sought to bury Sarah.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is explaining the verse according to the Sages’ view. @d1Until he had to buy it at a great expense.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 This means: Despite the fact that “I also established My covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan,” I did not fulfill it in their lifetimes — as they needed to buy land at great expense. Nevertheless, they did not question My ways. @d1And they did not ask about My Name Adonoy.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 In other words, [the Sages explain] the verse “I revealed Myself to Avraham.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (v. 3) to mean that “many times I revealed Myself to them with the Name Eil Shaddai and they never said, “What is Your Name?” But if so, the verse should have continued: “And they did @ITnot ask@it about My Name, Adonoy — unlike you [Moshe], who did ask Me about this.” @d1He did not make known that that is His Name.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi is saying] that either way we look at it, the Sages’ explanation is problematic. If the Sages hold that “I did not make known to them” means “they did not @ITask@it Me,” although He did inform the Patriarchs that His Name is Adonoy. But then the verse should have said, “And they did @ITnot ask@it about My Name, Adonoy” [as explained above]. And if the Sages maintain that “I did not make known to them” follows its literal meaning, [i.e., the Patriarchs did not know the Name Adonoy at all]. And the Sages added [a comment] to this, saying that the Patriarchs did not [even] ask Him [about His Name]. But then [a different problem arises:] Originally, when Hashem appeared to Avraham at @ITbris bein habesarim,@it He said to him: “I am Adonoy.<TIE>.<TIE>.” [So clearly, they knew His Name]. Furthermore, the Sages cannot explain “I did not make known to them” as Rashi does, i.e., “I was not @ITrecognized@it by them by My attribute of keeping trust.” For that implies that Hashem indeed informed the Patriarchs of His Name. That being so, the Sages could not add [a comment] to this, saying that the Patriarchs did not [even] ask Him about His Name. For once He informed them that His Name is Adonoy, there is no need for them to ask. (@ITRe’m@it) @d1And, furthermore, how is there continuity of context.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi’s comment] is puzzling. Perhaps the Torah is saying as follows: Since the Patriarchs are beloved to Me for not questioning My ways, that is why “I have heard the groaning of the B’nei Yisrael” — for the Patriarchs’ sake, even though the B’nei Yisrael do not act properly. “Therefore say to the B’nei Yisrael, ‘I am Adonoy.<TIE>.<TIE>.’” (@ITRe’m@it) But it seems that [Rashi’s comment is indeed understandable, because a difficulty arises] with the @ITRe’m’s @itapproach that the main reason for the redemption is Hashem’s love of the Patriarchs, although the Bnei Yisrael are not deserving. For earlier (3:11), Moshe asked [two questions]: “Who am I.<TIE>.<TIE>.? Am I able to bring the B’nei Yisrael out of Egypt?” And Rashi (@ITad loc@it) explained [the second question as follows]: “Even if I @ITam@it worthy, what did the B’nei Yisrael do to merit that a miracle be performed for them.<TIE>.<TIE>.?” But according to the @ITRe’m,@it Hashem should have replied: The miracle will come due to His love of the Patriarchs, although B’nei Yisrael are not deserving. @p1[12]@p2<TIE>Divide into many parts.@p3 In other words, the stone divides into many parts through the hammer. Thus did Rashi explain it in Maseches Shabbos (88b). But Tosafos (@ITad loc@it) challenged this, and explained it differently. See explanation there.<QC>
@d1“@HB<HEB>והערל@BO<ENG>” [meaning:] and become obstructed.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 In other words, Rashi is saying [@hh<HEB>והאטם@ee<ENG> as] an explanation of @hh<HEB>והערל@ee<ENG>. @d1This is one of the ten @BIa fortiori@BO inferences in the Torah.@p3 Rashi is telling us: Do not say that “How then will Pharaoh listen to me” is a separate statement [from “B’nei Yisrael have not listened to me”], and it means that Pharaoh will not listen for a @ITdifferent@it reason, which is: “I whose lips are covered.” Therefore, [to exclude this,] Rashi explains: “This is one of the ten @ITa fortiori@it inferences.” Thus [it follows that] the entire verse is one statement: [because Moshe’s lips are covered, therefore B’nei Yisrael did not listen — how then will Pharaoh listen?] This explains why Rashi switched the order of the verse and explained “I whose lips are covered” before explaining “How then will Pharaoh listen to me.” The @ITa fortiori@it inference is as follows: To B’nei Yisrael, the redemption is good tidings and they should have listened to me, yet they did not. To Pharaoh, it is bad tidings — all the more so he will not listen! You might object: This inference can be refuted, as B’nei Yisrael did not listen to Moshe for the reason of their great distress, as explained above (v. 9), [whereas Pharaoh is not in distress]. The answer is: Moshe did not know that B’nei Yisrael failed to listen out of distress; he thought it was because his lips are covered. Although the Torah writes that it was because of their distress [that they did not listen], as this was the true reason, Moshe did not know that. Thus he considered his inference to be solid, [although in truth it was refutable]. [You might ask:] Nevertheless, even after Hashem revealed to Moshe that they failed to listen due to their distress, [why is Moshe’s inference incorrect?] He could have incorporated the refutation into the @ITa fortiori@it, as we find a number of times in the Talmud, [and reasoned as follows: To B’nei Yisrael, the redemption is good tidings @ITand despite their distress@it they should have listened to me, yet did not. To Pharaoh, it is bad tidings — @ITand despite his lack of distress,@it all the more so he will not listen!] The answer is: This refutation is [based on a fact] written in the Torah. The Torah itself testifies that the [true] reason they failed to listen was their distress. Such a refutation cannot be incorporated [into the @ITa fortiori@it]. (thus wrote the @ITRe’m@it) @p1[13]@p2<TIE>To lead them with gentleness.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: The verse, [due to the word @hh<HEB>ויצום@ee<ENG>,] implies that B’nei Yisrael were commanded to bring themselves out of Egypt. Therefore Rashi explains: “He commanded them regarding the B’nei Yisrael.<TIE>.<TIE>.” In other words, @hh<HEB>ויצום@ee<ENG> means that Moshe and Aharon, were commanded to lead the B’nei Yisrael with gentleness, and to treat Pharaoh respectfully. And when it is written afterward “To bring out the B’nei Yisrael.<TIE>.<TIE>.” this is a separate statement.<QC>
@d1Its simple meaning.<TIE>.<TIE>. regarding the matter of Yisrael and regarding his mission.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [According to this,] the word @hh<HEB>להוציא@ee<ENG> (to bring out) refers to both matters. Hashem commanded Moshe regarding the matter of Yisrael, i.e., that Moshe should tell them that he will bring them out of Egypt. And Hashem commanded Moshe regarding his mission to Pharaoh, i.e., that Moshe and Aharon should tell Pharaoh to send the B’nei Yisrael out of Egypt. They should also warn Pharaoh that if he does not allow the B’nei Yisrael [to leave]; Hashem will bring suffering upon him. @p1[14]@p2<TIE>In the order of their births from Reuvein.@p3 You might ask: The difficulty remains unresolved, for why did the Torah not begin with [the genealogy of] the tribe of Leivi? The @ITRamban@it answers: If so, it would appear that from now on Leivi is considered the firstborn, in honor of Moshe. Therefore the Torah begins from Reuvein, to show that Reuvein is still the firstborn regarding to lineage, and Leivi is the third of the tribes. @p1[16]@p2<TIE>And Leivi outlived all of them.@p3 If so, it means that they were enslaved only 116 years. For [it says in @ITBereishis@it 41:46 that] Yoseif was 30 years old when he stood before Pharaoh, and [we know that] Leivi was then 34 — since all the sons of Yaakov were born within a 6-year period, except for Binyamin. Thus we subtract [from these 6 years] 2 years until Leivi was born, as Leivi was the third child after Reuven, and it means that Leivi was four years older than Yoseif [who was born last]. After [Yoseif stood before Pharaoh] there were seven years of bounty and two of famine, after which the B’nei Yisrael came to Egypt. At that time Leivi was 43 [34 plus 9], and he lived until 137. Subtract 43 from 137, and we are still left with 94 years of Leivi’s lifetime, during which the enslavement did not begin. Now, the B’nei Yisrael were in Egypt for 210 (@hh<HEB>רדו@ee<ENG>) years. Subtract Levi’s 94 years from these 210, and the result is that they were enslaved only 116 years. @p1[20]@p2<TIE>His father’s sister.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is telling us that we should not interpret this @hh<HEB>דודתו@ee<ENG> like the @hh<HEB>דודתך@ee<ENG> written in the section of forbidden relations (Vayikra 18:14): “Do not come close to @hh<HEB>דודתך@ee<ENG>,” where it means “your uncle’s wife.” [Here it cannot mean this,] as Yocheved was Leivi’s daughter, thus she was Kehos’s sister. For Kehos was Leivi’s son. And Kehos was Amram’s father. Thus, Yocheved was the sister of Amram’s father. @p1[23]@p2<TIE>When marrying a woman he should investigate her brothers.@p3 However, Lavan the brother of Rivka (Bereishis 25:20), is mentioned only “in order to praise Rivkah.” This is because Yitzchok surely would not have investigated Lavan [to know about Rivkah]. Furthermore, [it is different with Rivkah because] there was no need for Scripture to mention her father, brother or birthplace, as all were mentioned before — forcing us to say that they all have a Midrashic meaning. (@ITRe’m@it) And we cannot say that it indeed teaches us that one who contemplates marrying a woman should investigate all these factors. First of all, granted that investigating the woman’s brothers has a reason: [her children will probably resemble them] as most children resemble their mother’s brothers. But this is not true of her father, and certainly not of the people of her birthplace. Secondly, [if all of these factors should be investigated], why did Aharon only investigate Elisheva’s brother? We see that her father’s name is not mentioned — implying that Aharon investigated only her brother. @p1[25]@p2<TIE>Of the descendants of Yisro who fattened calves for idolatry.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi’s comment is based on Meseches Sotah (43a), that his father was from the tribe of Yoseif and his mother was from Yisro, or vice-versa. It seems to me that Rashi inferred this since @hh<HEB>פוט@hbי@hhאל@ee<ENG> is written with a @ITyud@it, denoting plural. Alternatively, [Rashi inferred it] since it is written @hh<HEB>בנ@hbו@hhת@ee<ENG>, also plural, which tells us that Scripture mentions her lineage in two ways. We need not ask: Perhaps Putieil is simply the name of an [unknown] person? For the answer is: Rashi inferred that this is not so, since it says above: “Aharon took Elisheva, daughter of Aminadav.<TIE>.<TIE>. for a wife.” Thus we see that Scripture intends to @ITexplain@it the lineage. Here as well, Putieil is coming to @ITexplain@it the lineage [and thus cannot refer to an unknown person]. @d1Who showed contempt for his evil inclination.@p3 Some explain @hh<HEB>פטפט@ee<ENG> as “defied,” and some explain it as “showed contempt.”<QC>
@p1[26]@p2<TIE>With their multitudes.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi explains this] because @hh<HEB>על צבאותם@ee<ENG> literally implies that Aharon and Moshe brought out B’nei Yisrael in greater numbers than their multitudes. Alternatively, it implies that they brought out the multitudes first, [and only then, the B’nei Yisrael] — and this is not so.<QC>
@p1[28]@p2<TIE>To be joined.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 For if this were not so, it would not be possible to explain “It was the day when Adonoy spoke.<TIE>.<TIE>.” [We are not told what happened on that day. Rather, [this verse] must be joined [to the following verse]. @p1[30]@p2<TIE>This is the same statement.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is referring to “.<TIE>.<TIE>.I whose lips are covered” (6:12), which comes after “Behold the B’nei Yisrael have not listened to me.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (@ITad loc@it) which is the first statement in that section. And it [“.<TIE>.<TIE>.I whose lips are covered”] is repeated here, in the second section. Rashi is @ITnot@it referring to “Behold the B’nei Yisrael have not listened.<TIE>.<TIE>.” as this [statement] is not repeated in the second section. (@ITRe’m@it) But I say that Rashi is referring to everything stated [in this verse] in the first section. Although “Behold the B’nei Yisrael have not listened to me.<TIE>.<TIE>.” is not repeated in the second section [in an express way], it is alluded to nevertheless. For a question arises: Why does the verse reverse [the order] that appeared before? In the first section it said, “How then will Pharaoh listen to me — I whose lips are covered?” Yet here it says, “Behold, I have covered lips. How will Pharaoh listen to me?” The answer must be that our verse [needs to be filled in and] is saying as follows: “Behold, @ITthe B’nei Yisrael have not listened to me. Even though my mission is for their benefit, nevertheless they have not listened to me, for the reason that@it I have covered lips. @ITIf so,@it how will Pharaoh listen to me?” And this is the same @ITa fortiori@it inference that was said in the first section. @p1[2]@p2<TIE>As you heard it from Me.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is explaining why it says, “@ITAll@it that I command you.” You (Moshe) will say each statement before Pharaoh, concisely and only once, just as you heard it from Me. And Aharon your brother will express each statement a few times, eloquently, until it is palatable to the ears of Pharaoh. (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1[3]@p2<TIE>And in opposition towards Me.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Pharaoh will surely defy Hashem if He hardens his heart. Is this Hashem’s way, to induce a person to transgress His will? Therefore Rashi explains, “And it is revealed to Me.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @d1It is better for Me that his heart be hardened.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 In other words, if I do not harden Pharaoh’s heart he will surely repent. But it is revealed to Me that he will not really repent wholeheartedly. And then, if I smite him with plagues and punish him, people will say that Hashem brings punishment upon repenters — for they will not know that Pharaoh’s repentance was not wholehearted. Therefore I will harden his heart so that he will not repent at all, and then I will be able to increase My wonders and punish him for all to see. @d1And you will thereby recognize My power.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi inferred this because it is written, “to @ITincrease@it My signs,” implying that Hashem will punish Pharaoh more severly in proportion ot his sins. This raises a difficulty: Why should Hashem want to bring more plagues on Pharaoh than he deserves? Thus Rashi explains: In order that “you will thereby recognize My power.” And Rashi then brings a proof for this concept: “This is the way of Hashem.<TIE>.<TIE>.”<QC>
@d1Nevertheless, concerning the first five plagues it does not say.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is saying that even though Hashem should have strengthened Pharaoh’s heart in the first five plagues as well, [He refrained from doing so] because He wished to publicize Pharaoh’s wickedness — so that people should know that even without Hashem strengthening his heart, he strengthens it on his own. Therefore, Hashem did not do so until after the first five plagues.<QC>
@p1[9]@p2<TIE>A sign.@p3 Since Rashi interprets @hh<HEB>מופתים@ee<ENG> as “wondrous plagues,” in Parshas Va’es’chanan (Devarim 4:34), he needed to explain that here @hh<HEB>מופת@ee<ENG> means “a sign.” @d1To make it known that there is power.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [@hh<HEB>צרוך@ee<ENG> means power], i.e., the One Who sends you has power and rulership, as it is written in Parshas Ha’azinu (Devarim 32:17), “They will sacrifice to demons that have no @ITpower@it,” and Onkelos there translates as, “.<TIE>.<TIE>.that have no @hh<HEB>צרוך@ee<ENG>.” @d1A serpent.@p3 The term @hh<HEB>תנין@ee<ENG> when on land means a serpent (i.e., a snake). And when in the sea it means a [kind of] fish. So too does the @ITRadak@it explain @hh<HEB>תנין@ee<ENG>.<QC>
@p1[11]@p2<TIE>For it appears to rotate by magic.@p3 In other words, this sword rotates on its own, and a person who sees it thinks it rotates by magic. Accordingly, the word @hh<HEB>להט@ee<ENG> which appears there connotes “magic.” @d1After it became a rod again did it swallow all the rest.@p3 I.e., since it is not written that “Aharon’s @ITserpent@it swallowed,” we infer that “after it became a rod.<TIE>.<TIE>.” If it was still a serpent when it swallowed the others, it would be only one miracle. But [this occurred] after they [all] became rods again, as it is also written “[Aharon’s @ITrod@it swallowed] their @ITrods@it,” so it was a double miracle. (@ITRe’m@it)<QC>

Whereas for the killing of the first-born, @hh<HEB>כה אמר ה'@ee<ENG> is written at the actual plague.@en@d1<QC>
@p1[19]@p2<TIE>The water in the wooden vessels and the stone vessels.@p3 Rashi is explaining that the plague affected only the water in the vessels, but not the wood and stone vessels themselves. @p1[22]@p2<TIE>@HB<HEB>בלטיהם@BO<ENG> refers to works of demons.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 This is because demons walk @hh<HEB>בלט@ee<ENG> (with stealth). In Sanhedrin 67b it says: R. Aiba bar Nagari said in the name of R. Chiya bar Abba, @hh<HEB>בלטיהם@ee<ENG> is works of demons; @hh<HEB>בלהטיהם@ee<ENG> is witchcraft. And so it says (Bereishis 3:24), “The @hh<HEB>להט@ee<ENG> of the sword.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Rashi (Sanhedrin, ibid.) explains @hh<HEB>בלטיהן@ee<ENG> as in (Shoftim 4:21): “And she went to him @hh<HEB>בלאט@ee<ENG> (with stealth).” @p1[25]@p2<TIE>@BIThe number@BO of seven days.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is explaining why it is not written @hh<HEB>וְיִמָּלְאוּ@ee<ENG>, [the plural form of “full,” instead of @hh<HEB>וימלא@ee<ENG>, which is the singular form.] Rashi explains that @hh<HEB>וַיִמָּלֵא@ee<ENG> refers to the @ITnumber@it, [which is singular,] and not to “seven days.” @d1For each plague functioned for a quarter of a month.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 in other words, seven days. You might object: But the plague of darkness lasted only six days, as indicated in Parshas Bo (10:22). The answer is: Later, in Parshas Beshalach (14:20) it said: “There was cloud and darkness and the night was illuminated.” This means: The cloud and darkness was for Egypt, while the night was illuminated for Yisrael. And why was there darkness for Egypt? Because there, Hashem punished them with the seventh day of darkness that He did not bring upon them at first. @p1[27]@p2<TIE>It is describing a person based on an ongoing action.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi is answering the question:] @hh<HEB>מָאֵן@ee<ENG> implies that Pharaoh constantly refuses. And that is not so, for just because Pharaoh refuses now, therefore will he constantly refuse? Thus Rashi explains: “It is describing.<TIE>.<TIE>.” [And to prove the point,] Rashi says it is similar to @hh<HEB>שלו ושקט@ee<ENG>, which [due to their grammatical form] imply a permanent, ongoing condition, yet [in fact they only] describe a temporary condition, [since no one is constantly serene and at ease]. Similarly with @hh<HEB>סר וזעף@ee<ENG>, which imply permanency although they are only temporary. Therefore Rashi explains, “It is describing.<TIE>.<TIE>.”<QC>
@d1They would enter and croak.@p3 @hh<HEB>מקרקרין@ee<ENG> means crying out and making noise.<QC>
@p1[5]@p2<TIE>By asking something difficult and then saying.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 In other words, [see] if you can ask me to do something that I cannot do, then you can boast that I [was shown to be inferior because I] could not do it. @d1By when do you wish them destroyed.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 You might ask: What was Moshe asking him? Surely Pharaoh would like them destroyed immediately! The answer is that Moshe reasoned: if I pray to have them destroyed immediately, Pharaoh will be obligated to release Yisrael immediately, as promised to me (v. 4) — and this is bad for him. Thus Moshe did not know which Pharaoh prefered — [keeping Yisrael, or destroying the frogs]. An alternative answer is what the @ITRamban@it says, citing the @ITNaggid@it.<QC>
@d1And not @HB<HEB>אעתר עתרו@BO<ENG>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi says as he does] because @hh<HEB>אעתיר העתירו והעתרתי@ee<ENG> is in the verbal form of @hh<HEB>הפעיל@ee<ENG>, which is transitive. However, our verse should use the [intransitive] form of @hh<HEB>אפעל@ee<ENG>, such as @hh<HEB>אעתר עתרו ועתרתי@ee<ENG>, since it is describing prayer, which is intransitive. Thus Rashi explains: “Because wherever a form of.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @d1So, too, does it say @HB<HEB>אעתיר@BO<ENG>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 In other words, it is transitive because the direct object of the verb is “words”. [It is conjugated] as if “words” was actually written in the verse. @d1@HB<HEB>והעתרתם@BO<ENG> your words about me, meaning @BIyou have increased@BO.@p3 Rashi is saying that [here is the main proof] because it is written explicitly, “your words”. @p1[6]@p2<TIE>Pray today that they be destroyed by tomorrow.@p3 [Rashi knows this because] Moshe had asked, “When should they be destroyed?” Thus Pharaoh’s answer must refer to the time of their destruction, [not about the time of praying]. So explained @ITRe’m@it. But this raises a difficulty: Why would Pharaoh want to suffer until the next day, and not ask for their immediate destruction? The answer is: Pharaoh thought that Moshe was a sorcerer who knows what times are auspicious. Pharaoh assumed that now is the auspicious time for destroying them, and when the time passes, Moshe will not be able to remove the frogs. Therefore he said “by tomorrow,” to show that Moshe works through sorcery. However, Moshe’s prayers were accepted whenever he prayed. (@ITMaharshal@it) People ask: Why at the plague of frogs does it say, “Moshe @ITcried out@it to Adonoy,” while at the other plagues it says, “Moshe @ITprayed@it to Adonoy”? The answer is: One who prays must hear what he is saying, and the frogs were croaking as Rashi explained, thus during the plague of frogs Moshe needed to raise his voice in order to hear himself pray.<QC>
@p1[11]@p2<TIE>And where had He said this? When He said, “Pharaoh will not listen.<TIE>.<TIE>.”@p3 You might ask: Why did Rashi not make this comment before, regarding the plague of blood, where it is written, “Pharaoh’s heart remained hardened.<TIE>.<TIE>. @ITjust as Adonoy had spoken@it” (7:22), or regarding Aharon’s staff swallowing the others (7:13)? The answer is: Before, since the plague had not yet passed [and Pharaoh was suffering] and nevertheless he was persisting in his wickedness, his heart was certainly hardened because of what Hashem had said, “Pharaoh will not listen to you.” But here it is written, “[When] Pharaoh saw that there was @ITrespite@it, he hardened his heart and did not listen to them, just as Adonoy had spoken.” Thus Rashi is explaining how we know that even when there is respite, Hashem said that he will still not listen — for which Rashi cites the verse (7:4), “Pharaoh will not listen to you,” after which is written, “But then I will display My hand.<TIE>.<TIE>.” The question arises: if it is speaking where the plague did not yet pass, why does it say: “But then I will display My hand”? Obviously, it must be speaking where Pharaoh will have respite, and nevertheless he will not listen — and “then I will display My hand.” @p1[14]@p2<TIE>“To bring forth lice.” To create them from elsewhere@p3. [Rashi is explaining:] Do not understand @hh<HEB>להוציא@ee<ENG> to mean that the sorcerers tried to remove the lice. Rashi knew this because it says “The sorcerers did @ITlikewise@it,” i.e., as Moshe and Aharon did.<QC>
@p1[17]@p2<TIE>There is a reason in aggadic writings.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Why did Hashem afflict Egypt with a swarm of animals from which they will benefit from the hides, meat, etc? Therefore Rashi explains: “There is a reason in aggadic writings.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (Found written in the name of the @ITMahara”d@it)<QC>
@p1[20]@p2<TIE>@HB<HEB>אתחבלת ארעא@BO<ENG> (past tense).@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Why is [it written] @hh<HEB>תשחת הארץ@ee<ENG> a term that denotes the future tense, if the land had already been devastated? Therefore Rashi cites Onkelos, who explains the term as @hh<HEB>אתחבלת ארעא@ee<ENG>, to prove that this term also denotes the past or present tense. @p1[21]@p2<TIE>Where you are, and do not go into the wilderness.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: [Since @hh<HEB>בארץ@ee<ENG> implies anywhere on earth, what is Pharaoh saying?] Would they sacrifice in heaven? Therefore Rashi explains: “Do not go into the wilderness,” for they had requested to go into the wilderness to sacrifice to Hashem. @p1[22]@p2<TIE>When speaking to Israel is it called abominable.@p3 I.e., Moshe called it abominable when speaking to Yisrael, but not when speaking to Egypt. @d1It would be despicable to Egypt.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., the word @hh<HEB>תועבה@ee<ENG> means “something despicable.” Accordingly, Moshe is saying this to the Egyptians themselves.<QC>
@p1[27]@p2<TIE>They did not die as did the frogs.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 You might ask: Why did Rashi not explain this before, where it said (v. 25), “And the wild animals will @ITdepart@it from Pharaoh”? The answer is: It was Moshe’s way to use the term “depart” when praying [to end a plague]. For we see earlier that Moshe prayed (v. 7): “The frogs will be @ITremoved.<TIE>.<TIE>.@it” yet it is written [that in fact,] “The frogs @ITdied@it.” [Note: it seems that the order of Rashi’s commentary on these verses was different than what we have, thus prompting the following comment.] Since @hh<HEB>ויסר@ee<ENG> (to depart) explains @hh<HEB>וסר@ee<ENG>, which is written above (v. 25) and appears @ITbefore@it @hh<HEB>ויעתר@ee<ENG> (v. 26), therefore Rashi explains @hh<HEB>ויסר@ee<ENG> (v. 27) before @hh<HEB>ויעתר@ee<ENG>, even though it is written afterwards. (@ITRe’m@it)<QC>
@p1[8]@p2<TIE>Is thrown only with one hand.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I do not know Rashi’s proof that Moshe threw [the furnace soot] with force. A possible answer: Here it is written @hh<HEB>השמימה@ee<ENG>, rather than @hh<HEB>על השמים@ee<ENG> as it is written about the plague of hail (v. 22). Apparently, Scripture changed the wording here to teach that Moshe sent up the soot unusually high, until the heavens. (see @ITRe’m@it) But it seems to me that [we need not find a proof for this, for] Rashi means to say the following: Anything that is thrown (@hh<HEB>נזרק@ee<ENG>), is thrown with force. This is because @hh<HEB>נזרק@ee<ENG> implies with all of one’s force, which is with one hand. See Bereishis Rabba ch. 5 and Vayikra Rabba ch. 7. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @d1Both his and Aharon’s handfuls.@p3 Rashi says this because it is written before, “Both of you take full handfuls.” [which is four handfuls in total]. @d1And another, that the soot spread over the entire land of Egypt.@p3 You might ask: Since [it spread so far only because] it was a miracle, why did Rashi explain that Moshe’s one fistful held both his and Aharon’s handfuls, [so that he could throw it with force]? [The miracle would be even greater if Moshe were to throw the soot with two hands and without any force and yet it travelled such a great distance.] Perhaps his fistful did not hold it, and Moshe threw with both hands [and it spread by a miracle]. The answer is: The miracle of its spreading over Egypt was not that it went farther than Moshe could throw, but that this small amount [of soot] covered the entire land of Egypt. [The fact that he was able to throw it with force because his fistful held both his and Aharon’s fistfuls does not pertain to this miracle. Rather, it is a miracle that stands on its own.] And according to what I explained above — that Rashi inferred from @hh<HEB>השמימה@ee<ENG> that Moshe threw with force — we may answer this question as well. Since @hh<HEB>השמימה @ee<ENG>implies with force, surely he threw with one hand, for he did not to rely on a miracle. @p1[9]@p2<TIE>Meaning of @BIheat.@p3 [Rashi explains this] because the verse implies that the rash [itself] caused the boils, which is incorrect. Therefore Rashi says that @hh<HEB>שחין@ee<ENG> “has the meaning of heat,” and the boils were caused by the heat.<QC>
@p1[10]@p2<TIE>And whoever feared the word of God made his livestock flee.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 People ask: Why does it state here, “Whoever feared the word of Hashem” relevant to this plague of pestilence? Furthermore, why indeed were the Egyptians not warned here [as they were regarding the hail]: “Now send word and shelter your livestock.<TIE>.<TIE>.”? @ITMahara”n@it answers: This plague [pestilence] did not need such a warning since Moshe said clearly, “Behold, the hand of Adonoy is directed at your livestock that are @ITin the field@it,” implying that the plague will manifest itself only in the field. Consequently, whoever feared the word of Hashem brought his livestock inside, since pestilence normally kills livestock. But hail does not usually kill livestock. Therefore, if the people were not warned, they would not have been particular about [not] leaving their livestock in the fields. (See @ITKitzur Mizrachi@it for other answers.) @en@d114. We learn from here that @HB@hb<HEB>מכת בכורות@BO<ENG>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 We cannot say that “@hh<HEB>מכת בכורות@ee<ENG>” means the slaying of the first-born, because if so, why is it mentioned here? Therefore, Rabbeinu Tam of Orleans explains it as @hh<HEB>מַכַּת בַּכּוּרוֹת@ee<ENG>, an expression of @hh<HEB>בִּכּוּרִים@ee<ENG> (ripening produce). This is because the plague of hail, [of which this section speaks,] smote only the ripe produce — as is written (v. 31), “Since the barley was ripe, and the flax had formed into stalks,” upon which Rashi comments, “@hh<HEB>שֶבִּכְּרוּ@ee<ENG>”. You might object: In Parshas Shemos (4:23) it says: “Behold, I will slay your firstborn son,” on which Rashi comments that the slaying of the firstborn was the most severe plague. An answer is: The slaying of the firstborn was indeed the most severe plague for Pharaoh. But for the people, who were left without anything to eat, hail was the most severe plague. Another answer is: When Rashi said that the hail “is equivalent to all the plagues,” this refers to the plagues that preceded it. However, the plagues that followed it were even more severe. The @ITMaharshal@it writes: According to Rabbeinu Tam of Orleans, why does our verse say: “For this time (@hh<HEB>בפעם הזאת@ee<ENG>), I will send.<TIE>.<TIE>.”? Rather, it seems to me that the verse means as follows: [Hashem is saying to Pharaoh,] “Do not think that I cannot kill you, by claiming that I first sent the severe plague of pestilence and then the lighter plague of boils — and thus I am unable to kill you, for otherwise why did I not kill you with pestilence.” Rather, “@hh<HEB>בפעם הזאת@ee<ENG>  I will send all my plagues.” In other words, the time will come when I will slay the first-born, [which is equivalent to all the plagues,] and then “you will know that there is none like Me in all the earth.” Then, you will admit yourself that “I [could] have extended My hand, and struck you and your people with the pestilence.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (v. 15). @p1[15]@p2<TIE>And your people together with the animals.@p3 Rashi is explaining that when the verse says “and struck you and your people,” it [is not excluding the animals. Rather it] means “@ITalso@it you and your people.”<QC>
@p1[18]@p2<TIE>When the sun reaches here the hail will come down.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because otherwise, why does our verse say: “tomorrow @ITat this time@it,” whereas with the plague of pestilence it says only “tomorrow”? (@ITGur Aryeh@it) The reason the pestilence [was not given an exact time] is that the animals were spread throughout the fields and Pharaoh would not know precisely when the pestilence began, thus nothing would be gained by scratching a mark in the wall. That is why the verse said simply “tomorrow” @p1[22]@p2<TIE>Over the heavens@p3. I.e., at first Moshe had control only over matters on earth. Now Hashem lifted Moshe up and gave him control over matters in heaven, and Moshe brought a plague from heaven.<QC>
@p1[24]@p2<TIE>A miracle within a miracle.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 One miracle was that a flame usually ascends, but here it descended. The second miracle was that the fire and ice did not extinguish, [or melt,] one another. [@ITRe’m, @itciting Shemos Rabba]. However, this does not seem correct [as an explanation of Rashi]. Firstly, fire descended many times from heaven to earth, both for good and for bad, and it was not considered miraculous. Secondly, the previous verse stated, “and fire came streaming down upon the earth,” but there it does not say, [“there had never been anything like it”]. There is a dispute over this point in Shemos Rabba, and it seems to me [that Rashi is following the view of Rabbi Nechemiah]. According to Rabbi Nechemiah, the fire and hail combined with each other. The fire was flashing from inside the pieces of hail, and both were burning. According to his view, the second miracle was that the hail burnt. This explanation is what Rashi intended, for he said: “The fire and the hail intermingled.” According to this, when Rashi finishes by saying: “they made peace between themselves,” he is referring to [the second miracle,] that they both were burning. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it)<QC>
@p1[29]@p2<TIE>Because it was full of idols.@p3 [A question arises:] During the plagues of frogs and wild beasts, Egypt was also full of idols. Assumedly, Moshe did not pray in the city. Why did it not say there, “When I leave the city”? The answer is: With those plagues, Moshe was praying for [it to stop] the next day. Since he had plenty of time, it was not necessary to tell Pharaoh, “When I leave the city.” But here Pharaoh said, “There has been enough of Hashem’s thunder and hail,” and requested that the hail stop before reaching earth. Thus Moshe should not have tarried, and needed to explain to Pharaoh: “[I will pray] when I leave the city,” but not in the city. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1[31]@p2<TIE>And is the same form as @HB<HEB>ושפו עצמותיו@BO<ENG>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Since the @hh<HEB>נ@ee<ENG> [of @hh<HEB>נכתה@ee<ENG>] is part of the root, the verb is incomplete and is missing the @hh<HEB>ה@ee<ENG> of the @hh<HEB>הפעל@ee<ENG> form, and it should have been written @hh<HEB>הנכתה@ee<ENG>. Therefore Rashi explains: “And is the same form as @hh<HEB>שפו@ee<ENG>.” In other words, since it is vocalized with a @ITshuruk@it, it is considered as if it were written with a @hh<HEB>ה@ee<ENG>.<QC>
@p1[33]@p2<TIE>In the category of @HB<HEB>כהתוך כסף@BO<ENG>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [@hh<HEB>בחלק@ee<ENG>] is in the same category, i.e., from the same root as @hh<HEB>כהתוך כסף@ee<ENG> (the pouring of metal). (From the @ITMaharan’s@it manuscript)<QC>
@p1[1]@p2<TIE>And warn him.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because it is written, “@hh<HEB>כי@ee<ENG> (for) I have hardened his heart.” Every @hh<HEB>כי@ee<ENG> that appears in Scripture comes to give a reason for what preceded. And if “Go in to Pharaoh” did not mean “and warn him,” how would @hh<HEB>כי@ee<ENG> be giving a reason for what preceded? This is what Hashem was saying to Moshe: [It is true that] warning Pharaoh will surely have no effect, since he did not send out the B’nei Yisrael in spite of his confession, “This time I have sinned” (9:27). Thus our verse explains: “For I have hardened his heart @ITand the hearts of his servants@it.” In other words, the warning is necessary for his servants, whose hearts had not yet hardened [and they rebelled in the plague of hail only because Hashem hardened their hearts]. The reason Hashem did not harden their hearts sooner [but He waited for the plague of hail to do so] is that the verse states there, “he that feared the word of Hashem .<TIE>.<TIE>. made his servants and his livestock flee.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (9:20). If Hashem had not hardened the servants’ hearts at that time, they would have insisted that Pharaoh release the B’nei Yisrael. Thus He hardened their hearts, “So that I will be able to set these signs in their midst.” Although [with the coming plague of locusts] Pharaoh’s servants said, “Send the men out” (20:7), their repentance was not wholehearted [and they deserved the ensuing punishment]. For they said to send only the men [and not the entire nation], as Pharaoh himself said, “The [adult] men should go.” (20:11) (@ITNachalas Yaakov,@it see further elaboration there) @p1@p2That I will set.@p3 We need not ask: The same word, @hh<HEB>שת@ee<ENG>, is written in Parshas Vayeitzei: “@hh<HEB>וישת@ee<ENG> his own flocks.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (Bereishis 30:40), and in Parshas Va’eira: “Pharaoh .<TIE>.<TIE>. did not @hh<HEB>שת@ee<ENG> even to this” (@ITShemos @it7:23). Why did Rashi not comment there? The answer is: Here [the @ITshin@it of] @hh<HEB>שתי@ee<ENG> is vocalized with a @ITchirik@it and no @ITyud@it, so I might think it does not mean @hh<HEB>שימי@ee<ENG> but is a different word, such as, “For they destroyed the @hh<HEB>שתות@ee<ENG> (foundation)” (Tehillim 11:3). Or, “@hh<HEB>שות שתו@ee<ENG> (they did battle) at the gates” (Yeshayah 22:7). That is why Rashi needs to explain it here as @hh<HEB>שימי@ee<ENG>, although generally, the meaning is obvious. Even after explaining that @hh<HEB>שתי@ee<ENG> means @hh<HEB>שימי@ee<ENG>, Rashi explains further and says, “that I will set,” because @hh<HEB>שתי@ee<ENG> still has two possible meanings. This is similar to @hh<HEB>תִּתִּי@ee<ENG>, which has two possible meanings. One is written regarding Lavan, in Parshas Vayetzei (Bereishis 29:19): “Better @hh<HEB>תִּתִּי@ee<ENG> (@ITI@it shall give) her to you.” The other [possible] meaning is written in Parshas Balak (Bamidbar 22:13): “For Hashem has refused @hh<HEB>לְתִתִּי@ee<ENG> (to give @ITto me@it) permission to go with you.” Thus Rashi explains that here, @hh<HEB>שתי@ee<ENG> means “@ITI@it will set” [and not “set @ITfor me@it”]. (@ITRe”m@it) Alternatively: Rashi explains further and says, “that I will set,” because @hh<HEB>שתי@ee<ENG> could mean the past tense, “I already set.” Thus Rashi explains “I @ITwill@it set,” is in the future tense.<QC>
@p1[3]@p2<TIE>Which is from the root @HB<HEB>עני@BO<ENG> — poor.@p3 Rashi is explaining that @hh<HEB>לענות@ee<ENG> does not mean servitude as in, “@hh<HEB>והתעני@ee<ENG> (submit yourself) under her power.” (Bereishis 16:9) Rashi continues by saying, “You have refused to be poor and humble,” because @hh<HEB>עני@ee<ENG> usually refers to [lack of] money, while here it refers to humility. @p1[5]@p2<TIE>The illumination of the land.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: What is the meaning of @hh<HEB>עין הארץ@ee<ENG> (literally, “the eye of the land”), since land does not have eyes? Therefore Rashi explains: “The illumination of the land.” The shining of the sun brings illumination upon the land, enabling one to see the land. And that illumination, which is from the sun, was covered up [by the locusts]. Consequently, one could not see the land.<QC>
Onkelos explains similarly: “The illumination @ITof the sun@it of the land.” @p1[7]@p2<TIE>Did you as yet not realize.@p3 Rashi’s view is that @hh<HEB>טרם@ee<ENG> means “not yet,” as he explained the verse in Parshas Bereishis (2:5), “The vegetation of the fields had @ITnot yet@it sprouted,” and in Parshas Va’era (Shemos 9:30), “You are @ITnot yet@it in fear.” Thus, @hh<HEB>טרם@ee<ENG> should not be explained as “before.” Accordingly, @hh<HEB>תדע@ee<ENG> really denotes past tense although it is written in the form of future tense.<QC>
@p1[8]@p2<TIE>They were brought back by a messenger.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo Rashi is answering the question: [If they returned on their own,] Scripture should have written @hh<HEB>וַיָשוּבוּ@ee<ENG> (“and they went back”). Whereas @hh<HEB>ויושב@ee<ENG> is a passive form, implying that Moshe and Aharon were acted upon by others. @p1[10]@p2<TIE>Even were I to send.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi explains as he does because their flocks and cattle were more valuable to Pharaoh than were their children; for note that after the plague of darkness Pharaoh said (v. 24): “Just let your flocks and cattle stay behind. Even your little ones can go with you.” This implies that even though Pharaoh agreed to their children going with them, he still did not want their flocks and cattle to go with them. Accordingly, this is the meaning of the verse. Pharaoh said to them: You asked to send your children, flocks and cattle. May Hashem be with you [to protect you from disaster] if I send you and your children, and surely if I also send the flocks. This is because @hh<HEB>אף כי@ee<ENG> is like @hh<HEB>כל שכן@ee<ENG> (all the more so). And so it is in Parashas Vayelech (Devarim 31:27): “@hh<HEB>אף כי@ee<ENG> (all the more so) after my demise.” (See @ITKitzur Mitzrachi@it for other versions of Rashi)<QC>
@p1[11]@p2<TIE>This service.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is explaining that @hh<HEB>אותה@ee<ENG> refers to @hh<HEB>עבודה@ee<ENG>, i.e., “go and worship Hashem,” [although the actual word @hh<HEB>עבודה@ee<ENG> does not appear in the verse]. @hh<HEB>אותה@ee<ENG> cannot refer to the men, for then it should say, “@hh<HEB>אותם@ee<ENG>”. (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1@p2Is what you requested till now.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 But we cannot say it means what they are requesting now, since now they are requesting also the children, flocks and cattle. @p1@p2This is a shortened statement.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 But we cannot say that Pharaoh himself expelled them, because it is written, “from Pharaoh’s presence.”<QC>
@p1[14]@p2<TIE>The likes of which never had been and never would be.@p3 @ITRamban@it and @ITRe”m@it explain Rashi at length, but I say that Rashi’s own words elsewhere explain his intention. Rashi says on Sefer Yoel (2:2): “But the species of @ITArbeh@it on its own was not like that of Egypt.” This supports @ITRe”m@it who said that the @ITArbeh@it of Moshe was greater than the @ITArbeh@it of Yoel, while the plague of Yoel was greater because of the multiple species it included. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) Some object and say that also the plague of Moshe had three species, as it is written (Tehillim 78:46) “@ITArbeh, Chasil,@it” and (105:34) “@ITYelek@it.” We could answer that the multiple terms in Tehillim are only for rhetorical purpose [while in truth there was just @ITArbeh@it]. Similarly [we find multiple terms used rhetorically]: “He killed with @IThail@it their vineyards, and their sycamores with @IThail-stones@it” (ibid. 78:47). And likewise, “He trapped their cattle by the @IThail@it, their herds by the @ITplague@it.”(ibid. v. 48) @p1[15]@p2<TIE>A green leaf.@bo Rashi is answering the question: How can the word @hh<HEB>ירק@ee<ENG> (green vegetable) apply to trees? For it is written (Bereishis 9:3): “@hh<HEB>כירק עשב@ee<ENG> (as the vegetable herbs),” and herbs in the fields are referred to as @hh<HEB>ירקות@ee<ENG>. Therefore Rashi explains it as “a green leaf,” as if the verse had actually said “green leaf.” Rashi proves this from “@ITVerdure@it in Old French” which means green leaf [and comes from the root of @ITverd,@it “green”]. And so it is in Hebrew.<QC>
@p1[19]@p2<TIE>Not even a salted one that they had salted.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Since it is already written, “Carried away the locusts,” why does Scripture add, “Not a single locust remained”? It must come to include even the salted ones. And regarding the plague of wild beasts, Scripture did not need to indicate that even the salted ones did not remain. Since they were dangerous animals, the Egyptians surely were afraid to trap them.<QC>
@p1[21]@p2<TIE>The darkness of night will become even more black and dark.@p3 The phrase@hh<HEB>ויאמש חשך@ee<ENG> (He will darken the night) implies that night has already arrived. But “And there will be darkness” implies that the plague created a new darkness. Therefore Rashi explains: [“A darkness greater than the darkness of night.<TIE>.<TIE>.”] @p1@p2Is the same as @HB<HEB>ויאמש@BO<ENG> (He will darken).@p3 This word is like @hh<HEB>אמש@ee<ENG>, which means night. For yesterday is referred to as @hh<HEB>אתמול@ee<ENG>, and last night is referred to as @hh<HEB>אמש@ee<ENG>. @p1@p2After the darkness of night has departed.@p3 This means: After Hashem removes the darkness of night and the day has begun, at that moment that darkness will begin.<QC>
@p1[22]@p2<TIE>Why did He bring darkness on them?@p3 You might ask: In Parshas Va’era, Rashi explained the verse: “For if you do not send out My people” (8:17), that the reason for each plague is in accordance with the strategies of war, based on Midrash Tanchuma. If so, why does Rashi need to give a reason here for the plague of darkness? Furthermore, why did Rashi not ask this question [as his first comment] on the verse? The answer is: Rashi is explaining why Hashem brought such total darkness. [Ordinary] darkness that does not allow one person to see another would be sufficient [as a war strategy]. Therefore Rashi explains: “Because there were.<TIE>.<TIE>. [among B’nei Yisrael.<TIE>.<TIE>. Furthermore, the Israelites searched.<TIE>.<TIE>.]” @p1@p2Furthermore, the Israelites searched and saw their vessels.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo It seems to me that [Rashi means as follows]: First he asks why there was darkness, i.e., why did the plague change so that at the end it was darker than at the beginning? Rashi answers [that there were two reasons for the darkness]. At first the darkness was needed only so the Egyptians would not see the downfall of the evil Israelites. Ordinary darkness was sufficient for this, and Hashem did not want to change nature more than necessary. Then after three days, and they were all dead and buried, Hashem brought extreme darkness to immobilize the Egyptians so B’nei Yisrael could enter their homes and search their vessels, and the Egyptians were unable to stop them. We need not ask: Why was all this necessary? Is it not written (12:36), “Hashem granted the people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians,” and the Egyptians even lent them items they did not ask for [see Rashi there]? The answer is: Since the Egyptians saw that B’nei Yisrael could have taken everything they owned during the days of darkness, without anyone to stop them, yet they did not take anything — this is what made B’nei Yisrael favorable in their eyes, and they even lent items that they did not ask for. (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1@p2A threesome of days.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Why did the verse not simply write @hh<HEB>שלושה ימים@ee<ENG> (three days)? The word @hh<HEB>שלשת@ee<ENG> with a @ITtav@it is in the @ITnismach@it form (lit. three of days); why is this form needed? Furthermore, @hh<HEB>ימים@ee<ENG> is masculine [and should therefore have an adjective in the masculine form,] but @hh<HEB>שלשת@ee<ENG> is feminine! Therefore, Rashi explains that it means “a three@ITsome@it of days.” @p1[24]@p2<TIE>Shall remain in its place.@p3 [Rashi is explaining that although @hh<HEB>יצג@ee<ENG> is in the future tense], it@BO @bodoes not mean “@ITwill@it remain,” starting from now. This is because the sheep and cattle were already in their place. @p1[26]@p2<TIE>The hoof of the foot.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: @hh<HEB>פרסה@ee<ENG> implies that Moshe requested only the animals with “split hooves” (@hh<HEB>מפרסת פרסה@ee<ENG>). Yet this cannot be, for in the beginning of the verse, does it not say, “Our own flocks will @ITalso@it go with us,” implying every animal? Therefore Rashi explains that @hh<HEB>פרסה@ee<ENG> means “the hoof of the foot, (@ITplante@it in Old French).”<QC>
 @p1@p2The magnitude of the service.@bo [Rashi explains as he does because] it cannot be that they did not know what the service would be. For note that they said, “Our own flocks.<TIE>.<TIE>. We must take from them to worship Hashem our God.” Similarly, many times previously they said, “To sacrifice to Hashem.” @p1[29]@p2<TIE>You have spoken properly and you have spoken at the right time.@p3 “You have spoken properly” is Rashi’s explanation of: “As you say.” This follows Onkelos’ translation, @hh<HEB>יאות מלילתא@ee<ENG>. Therefore Rashi explains @ITwhy@it Pharaoh has spoken properly: He has spoken at the right time, since “it is true that I will never see your face again.”<QC>
@p1[1]@p2<TIE>He will send you all away.@p3 [Rashi is explaining that @hh<HEB>כלה@ee<ENG> is] not from the word @hh<HEB>כלייה@ee<ENG> (destruction). Rather it is like @hh<HEB>כליל תקטר@ee<ENG> (Vayikra 6:15), which Onkelos translates as @hh<HEB>גמירא@ee<ENG> (@ITcompletely@it burnt). And there, @hh<HEB>גמירא@ee<ENG> cannot mean “destruction,” rather it means “completely.” @p1[2]@p2<TIE>@HB<HEB>נא@BO<ENG> can only indicate.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi means that @hh<HEB>נא@ee<ENG> written @IThere@it can only indicate pleading [but in other places it can mean “now”]. @p1@p2Speak to them about this.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 You might ask: Since Hashem told it to Moshe, is it not obvious that he will tell it to B’nei Yisrael? The answer is: Moshe did not intend to instruct them about this because [if they fail to return the borrowed items] it will be like holding stolen property. However, Hashem considered it as having received wages for their work (Sanhedrin 91a). Another answer: [Moshe was concerned that] the Egyptians will be troubled by the loss of their property and will chase after them. Therefore, Moshe needed to be told to instruct them.<QC>
@p1[4]@p2<TIE>While still standing before Pharaoh.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 You might ask: Earlier (11:1), it says similarly: “Hashem said to Moshe, ‘There is one more plague.<TIE>.<TIE>.’” Furthermore, “I will not see your face again” was written previous to it. Why then did Rashi not make a similar comment there? The answer is: The content of the earlier verse (11:1) was actually told to Moshe before, for it is written (3:21): “I will give this people grace.<TIE>.<TIE>.” But it is merely repeated here, because now was the time for its fulfillment. This section, in contrast, is dealing with the exodus from Egypt, and that the plague will be at midnight, was not hinted anywhere else. Perforce, this prophecy was told to Moshe while still standing before Pharaoh. You might ask: If Moshe would not even offer a simple prayer within the city, how could he be given a full prophecy there [see Rashi 11:1]? The answer is: [Hashem did it] for Moshe’s honor so that he should not be considered a liar. Otherwise, Moshe would need to go back to Pharaoh [to announce Hashem’s prophecy, but Moshe had already told Pharaoh that he would not see his face again]. Alternatively: Hashem lifted Moshe ten handbreadths above the ground when He spoke to him, thus placing him in a separate domain. (@ITRe”m@it) @p1@p2For @HB<HEB>חצות@BO<ENG> is not the noun.@p3 I.e., [Rashi is telling us that the term] @hh<HEB>חצות@ee<ENG> here is not a noun like it is in (Tehillim 119:62), “@hh<HEB>חצות לילה@ee<ENG> (In@IT the middle@it of the night) I will rise to praise You.” Here this is not so, because it is preceded by a @hh<HEB>כ@ee<ENG>, which is not appropriate for a noun. Furthermore, @hh<HEB>כחצות@ee<ENG> implies uncertainty as to when midnight is, and surely, Hashem has no such doubt! Thus @hh<HEB>כחצות@ee<ENG> must mean, “When the night is divided.” @p1@p2Which implies at about midnight.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo I.e., our Sages say that @hh<HEB>חצות@ee<ENG> here is indeed a noun, meaning “@ITthe middle@it of the night.” Hashem told Moshe @hh@hb<HEB>ב@hh@hhחצות הלילה@ee<ENG>, meaning @ITexactly@it at midnight, but — lest Pharaoh’s stargazers say, “Moshe is a liar!” —Moshe changed it to @hh@hb<HEB>כ@hh@hhחצות@ee<ENG>, meaning at @ITabout@it midnight  @p1@p2And say, “Moshe is a liar!”@bo You might ask: Why should Moshe change Hashem’s words just so these fools will not err? The answer is: From the third plague on, the sorcerers admitted to the authenticity of Moshe’s prophecy. Thus Moshe feared that a desecration of Hashem’s Name might occur at the very conclusion, lest they err now and they will deny the previous prophecies. (@ITRabbeinu Bechayeh@it) @p1[5]@p2<TIE>Why were the captives struck down?@p3 You might ask: The verse mentions the first-born of the captives only later (12:29), in connection with the plague itself. Why does Rashi explain it here [in connection with the warning]? An answer is: Rashi explained above, according to our Sages, that Moshe said “@ITabout@it midnight” because Pharaoh’s sorcerers might say that he is a liar. Yet we might object: Here, they surely will say that Moshe lied! For Moshe said [in his warning], “From the first-born of Pharaoh.<TIE>.<TIE>. to the first-born of the [Egyptian] slave girl,” including everyone in between, but excluding those lowlier than the slave girl. Yet later on, in connection with the plague itself, it is written that also the captives were smitten, and they are lowlier, as Rashi explains there. Thus Rashi explains here why the first-born of the captives were struck down, to answer the above objection. [The sorcerers would not err] because they knew that Moshe warned only regarding those who oppressed B’nei Yisrael — i.e., the first-born of Pharaoh until the first-born of the slave girl. But Moshe’s warning did not include the captives. [For the plague came primarily to punish those who enslaved B’nei Yisrael, and] the captives did not enslave them. [As Rashi explains, they died only so that they should not say, “Their own god.<TIE>.<TIE>. brought retribution upon the Egyptians.”] Nevertheless, [we could object to the above explanation:] Moshe did not say clearly that the captives are excluded, for the term “first-born of the Egyptian slave girl” could be referring to “the lowly ones,” including the captives. Thus another answer is: Rashi is defending what he explained above, that Moshe changed Hashem’s word because of what the sorcerers might say. If we object that this is no reason to change Hashem’s word, Rashi answers us: “Why were the captives struck down? .<TIE>.<TIE>.So they should not say.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Thus we see that the captives did not really deserve this, as they did not oppress B’nei Yisrael, and were struck down only because of what they might say. And Moshe changed Hashem’s word for the same reason.  @p1@p2Because they too enslaved them and rejoiced in their oppression.@bo Enslavement alone is not sufficient reason, as it was not a complete enslavement. And rejoicing alone is not sufficient reason, for no action was involved. Thus both reasons are needed. (@ITMaharshal@it)<QC>
@p1[8]@p2<TIE>Together with all the people.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Why should Pharaoh care if only Moshe leaves? Furthermore, even if he leaves with all the people, but they only leave the city to worship and then return, [why should Pharaoh care]? Therefore Rashi [further] explains, “From your land.” @p1@p2But only after concluding his words.@p3 Moshe left after concluding the whole section of “About the time of midnight.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Although Pharaoh had told Moshe to leave [earlier], Moshe did not leave. @p1@p2Because Pharaoh had said to him, “Do not see my face again!”@bo Rashi is answering the question: On the contrary, should not Pharaoh have been angry with Moshe, for warning him and speaking harshly to him? Therefore Rashi explains, “Because he had said to him.<TIE>.<TIE>.”<QC>
@p1[9]@p2<TIE>The killing of the first-born.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 This raises a difficulty: It is written, “In the land of Egypt,” but these wonders were outside of Egypt. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it)<QC>
@p1[2]@p2<TIE>Moshe had difficulty regarding the renewal of the moon, how much of it must be visible so that it be fit to be consecrated.@p3 @ITRe”m@it cited and compared many sources but they are not connected.<TIE>.<TIE>. However, it seems clear to me that exceptional wisdom is needed in this matter. It says in Maseches Rosh Hashanah 20b: “Said R. Zeira said R. Nachman, ‘The new moon is invisible for twenty-four hours. For us [in Bavel], it is six from the old moon and eighteen from the new. For them [in Eretz Yisroel] it is six from the new and eighteen from the old.’” And this is the point over which Moshe had difficulty: is it six hours from the new, or is it eighteen from the new? (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it)<QC>
@p1[3]@p2<TIE>Has it not already been stated “You speak?”@p3 Rashi’s words are difficult to understand. For perhaps when it says (Shemos 7:2): “You (Moshe) speak,” it means that Moshe speaks to Aharon, but to B’nei Yisrael, both speak together. Furthermore, even if it means that Moshe alone speaks, this was said in connection to Pharaoh, i.e., Moshe speaks alone when he is speaking to Pharaoh, but to B’nei Yisrael both speak. The answer is: Although it is written, “Aharon your brother will be your spokesman” (7:1), Moshe must first concisely tell the message to Pharaoh once, just as he heard it from Hashem. And that is the meaning of, “You (Moshe) speak.” Afterwards, Aharon will express it eloquently until it is palatable to Pharaoh. And the same is true regarding B’nei Yisrael, as it is written (4:16), “He will speak to the people for you.” Aharon will speak [eloquently] to the people for you, but [first] you must concisely tell them the message once. (@ITRe”m@it) @p1@p2Speak today, on the first of the month.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo I.e., “On the tenth of this month” does not refer to when to speak, rather when to take the lamb. Otherwise the verse should have stated, “On the tenth of this month @hh<HEB>לאמר@ee<ENG> (say), ‘they shall take.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Then it would mean, “Speak on the tenth.” But since @hh<HEB>לאמר@ee<ENG> comes before “On the tenth of this month,” it refers back to “on the first of the month.”<QC>
@p1@p2The @BIkorbon Pesach@BO in Egypt.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because @hh<HEB>הזה@ee<ENG> (“@ITthis@it month”) excludes [any @ITkorbon Pesach@it brought in later years]. The @ITMaharshal@it explains that [Rashi knows this] because otherwise the verse should have [reversed the order] and said, @hh<HEB>ויקחו להם בעשור לחודש@ee<ENG>, thus telling us that the taking is to be on the tenth. But the verse is written as it is, to tell us that only this time is the taking [of the @ITkorbon@it @ITPesach@it] on the tenth, but not for all generations. @p1@p2[One lamb] per family.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Later (v. 21), Moshe tells B’nei Yisrael to take “a lamb @hh<HEB>למשפחותיכם@ee<ENG> (for your @ITfamilies@it).” Thus we know that @hh<HEB>בית אבות@ee<ENG> [mentioned in our verse] is the same as @hh<HEB>משפחות@ee<ENG>. That is why Rashi explains @hh<HEB>למשפחותיכם@ee<ENG> (v. 21) to mean @hh<HEB>בית אבות@ee<ENG>. @p1[4]@p2<TIE>While the lamb still exists, while it is still alive.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., our Sages [change the @hh<HEB>ה@ee<ENG> of @hh<HEB>מהיות@ee<ENG> to a @hh<HEB>ח@ee<ENG>, and] interpret @hh<HEB>מהיות משה@ee<ENG> (while the lamb still exists) as @hh<HEB>מחיותו דשה@ee<ENG> (while the lamb is still alive); because the letters @hh<HEB>אחע"ה@ee<ENG> are interchangeable. @p1@p2Each according to his fitness to eat.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi is answering the question:] The @ITkorbon Pesach@it is eaten only after one is full. If so, why does it go according to how much a person eats, [if he has already eaten his fill]? Thus Rashi explains @hh<HEB>לפי אכלו@ee<ENG> as one who is fit to eat [a @ITkezayis@it]. @p1@p2You will be counted.@p3 Rashi cites Onkelos who translates it as @hh<HEB>תתמנון@ee<ENG> so we will not say that @hh<HEB>תכוסו@ee<ENG> means, “you will count others.” (@ITRe”m@it) However, it seems to me that Rashi [cites Onkelos] so we will not say that @hh<HEB>תכוסו@ee<ENG> means, “you will slaughter.” [We might think this because] “Do not slaughter” (Vayikra 22:28) is translated by Onkelos as @hh<HEB>לא תכסון@ee<ENG>. And so is @hh<HEB>תכוסו@ee<ENG> interpreted in the Talmud. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1[5]@p2<TIE>Its entire [first] year it is called.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 This excludes an animal after one year of its life has passed. Although it has not yet lived two full years, it is unfit for the @ITkorbon Pesach@it. So says Rashi in Maseches Pesachim (97b), that a male in its second year is unfit for the @ITkorbon Pesach@it. (@ITNachalas Yaakov,@it see further proofs there) @p1@p2Either one or the other.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi is explaining that the beginning of our verse, where it says @hh<HEB>שה@ee<ENG>, means also either one or the other] — as it is written (Devarim 14:4), @hh<HEB>ושה עזים@ee<ENG>. And if you suggest that [the end of our verse is to be understood literally], “One from the sheep @ITand@it one from the goats,” then the [beginning of our] verse should have said @hh<HEB>שיים@ee<ENG> (plural form), as a goat is also called @hh<HEB>שה@ee<ENG>. Perforce our verse means, “Either one or the other.” @p1[6]@p2<TIE>Why was it necessary to acquire it four days before its slaughter.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Why did Rashi not ask this question on (v. 3), “On the tenth of this (@hh<HEB>הזה@ee<ENG>) month they shall take.<TIE>.<TIE>.”? It seems that the answer is: There we would have assumed that the four days [before its slaughter] are to examine the animal against blemishes, a law that applies also to the @ITkorbon Pesach@it of later generations. For @hh<HEB>הזה@ee<ENG> excludes only the @ITPesach sheini@it sacrifice from the four days of examination. But now that it is written here, “You shall @IThold it in safekeeping,@it” which implies examining, we know that “they shall take” (v. 3) means actually acquiring the animal [as a @ITkorbon Pesach@it]. If so, the question arises: Why did it have to be acquired as a @ITkorbon Pesach@it four days before its slaughter, when the @ITkorbon Pesach@it of later generations may be acquired at any time [prior to its slaughter]? But we could challenge this explanation: How does the statement of R. Masia b. Cheresh answer the question? [Acquiring the animal is a one-time act, not a mitzvah “with which to be occupied” for four days.] Furthermore, why is the mitzvah done four days before its slaughter — no less and no more? This matter requires further investigation.<QC>
@p1@p2And because they were immersed in idol worship.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Here, Rashi is offering an additional reason: “And because they were.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1@p2From here we derive that “the agent of a person is as himself.”@p3 You might ask: Why was this not derived from (v. 3), “Each man [shall take] a lamb for [his] family,” where one man takes a lamb for the entire family? Furthermore, perhaps the case in our verse is different [from most cases where “the agent of a person is as himself”] since in our case both the person and the agent are partners in the animal? The answer is: The rule is derived from both verses together. One verse tells us the rule where there is a partnership. And since the rule is repeated in the second verse, this tells us to apply it even where there is no partnership. So it is explained in Maseches Kiddushin 42a. (@ITRe”m@it) @ITNachalas Yaakov@it disagrees, and concludes: It seems to me that [the rule is derived as follows:] It should have said, “@ITThey@it shall slaughter @ITthem@it,” implying that many people shall slaughter many Pesach sacrifices. Or it could have said, “@ITHe@it shall slaughter @ITit@it.” However when it is written, “@ITThey@it shall slaughter @ITit@it,” the question arises: “But did they all slaughter it? From here we derive.<TIE>.<TIE>.”<QC>
@p1[7]@p2<TIE>This refers to the @BImitzvah@BO of “taking the blood.”@p3 [Rashi knows this because] it only needed to say, “and place (some of) its blood.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Why did it say also, “they shall take”? To teach us about @hh<HEB>קבלת הדם@ee<ENG> (taking the blood). @p1@p2I might think that it is taken by hand.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi means as follows: Since we learn@hh<HEB>קבלת הדם@ee<ENG> from “They shall take,” and it is not written into what to put the blood, therefore, “I might think that it is taken by hand. Therefore the Torah states, ‘Which is in the basin.’” (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1@p2In which people do not reside.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because it is written, “In which they will eat.” And we cannot say that the verse means to place blood only on the houses in which they actually@IT @iteat, but not on other houses, even if they are fit to live in. For it is written later (v. 13), “on the houses where you are [staying],” implying that blood should be put on all houses that are fit to live in, even if they do not eat there. @p1[8]@p2<TIE>But not the sinews or the bones.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because otherwise Scripture should have written, “They shall eat @ITit@it,” without mentioning “the meat.” (@ITGur Aryeh@it) The sinews referred to here are the ones so tough that they are not [normally] eaten. @p1@p2Any bitter herb is called @HB<HEB>מרור@BO<ENG>.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because it is written, “Matzos and bitter herbs,” comparing one to the other. Just as any seed-plant that turns to leaven may be used for matzah, so too with @hh<HEB>מרור@ee<ENG>: any seed-plant that is a bitter herb may be used for @hh<HEB>מרור@ee<ENG>. @p1[9]@p2<TIE>The Torah tells us @HB<HEB>ובשל מבושל@BO<ENG> to include anything boiled.@p3 In other words, since it is written @hh<HEB> ,מים@ee<ENG>we would think that boiling is forbidden only in water. Therefore it says [the repetitive term] @hh<HEB>ובשל מבושל@ee<ENG>, to include all liquids [in the prohibition]. You might ask: Let the verse omit @hh<HEB>מים@ee<ENG> and [thereby eliminate the need to say] @hh<HEB>מבושל@ee<ENG>, and mention only @hh<HEB>נא@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>ובשל@ee<ENG>? @ITRe”m@it answers: Cooking includes roasting, as it is written [later about the @ITkorbon Pesach@it], “You shall cook it and eat it” (Devarim 16:7), and Rashi there explains, “Roasting is also called cooking.” That is why our verse needed to state that only @hh<HEB>מים@ee<ENG> [is forbidden to cook with], but not roasting [which is permitted, and consequently Scripture needed to forbid all liquids]. This was needed even though it is written, “But only roasted over fire,” and we would know that here, cooking does not include roasting. @p1@p2He roasts it all as one with its head together with its legs together with its inner parts.@p3 Rashi is clarifying the meaning of the verse, for we might have said that the @ITkorbon Pesach@it’s head, legs and inner parts are all roasted together, and the rest of the sheep by itself. Therefore Rashi explains that the entire sheep is roasted as one. @p1@p2And he places its intestines inside after having rinsed them.@p3 @ITRe”m@it writes: “This is true only according to R. Yosi HaGelili, while R. Akiva disagrees and says that this would be like cooking — the intestines should rather be suspended outside the sheep. But it is puzzling that Rashi follows R. Yosi HaGelili’s view rather than R. Akiva’s, when the Halachah generally follows R. Akiva’s view over that of any single Sage who disagrees with him.” The @ITNachalas Yaakov@it writes: If Rashi was following R. Yosi’s view, then why would he say that only the intestines are placed inside? He should have said that even the legs are placed inside! Rather, it seems to me that according to Rashi, [all views agree that the intestines are placed inside,] just as all agree that the head is [not] placed inside. And the only disagreement is over the legs. (see @ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1[10]@p2<TIE>Because “morning” signifies the time of sunrise.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 This is puzzling, for in many places in the Talmud we see that @hh<HEB>בקר@ee<ENG> refers to daybreak @hh<HEB>עמוד השחר@ee<ENG>, and Rashi clearly says so himself in Berachos 9a and Pesachim 120b. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1@p2On the following morning go and burn it.@p3 The reason why Rashi says @hh<HEB>עד בקר שני @hbתעמוד@hh ותשרפנו@ee<ENG> rather than simply quoting the verse, which says @hh<HEB>עד בקר באש תשרפו@ee<ENG>, is so that we do not err and say that the verse means that the @ITkorbon Pesach@it should be burned continuously from the first day until the second day. Rashi says that we should not begin to go burn it until the second day. (@ITRe”m@it) Furthermore, Rashi says @hh<HEB>תעמוד@ee<ENG> so we will not think that while the verse prohibits burning it before the second day, one is permitted not to burn it altogether. Therefore Rashi says @hh<HEB>תעמוד@ee<ENG>, implying that it is a positive mitzvah to burn it. (@ITGur Aryeh@it) @p1[11]@p2<TIE>Ready to travel.@bo Rashi means that they do not actually have to belt their waists; rather, they should hurry as though they want to leave to travel.<QC>
@p1@p2The @BIkorbon @BOis called “Pesach” on account of the skipping.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is explaining [the verse in light of the following:] “It is a Pesachoffering @ITto Hashem@it” comes to give the reason why “You must eat it in haste,” [the reason being that haste emulates Hashem’s skipping]. @p1@p2You perform all its service for the sake of Hashem.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 The correct version is [as it appears in this book]: “You perform all its service for the sake of Hashem in a manner of skipping and springing as a remembrance of its name.<TIE>.<TIE>.” I.e., the phrase @hh<HEB>דבר אחר@ee<ENG> should not preface the words, “In a manner of skipping.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1[12]@p2<TIE>As if He were a king who passes from place to place.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is saying that Hashem was like a king who passes straight through without turning aside into the city’s alleys. Although Hashem passed through on one road only, the first-borns of Egypt were struck whether they were on that road or elsewhere. This is what “I will pass through” comes to teach us. (@ITRe”m@it)<QC>
@p1@p2Also other first-born who were in Egypt.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because otherwise, what does [the verse’s repetition of] @hh<HEB>בארץ מצרים@ee<ENG> come to teach? @p1@p2I myself, not through an agent.@bo [Rashi knows this] because it is written, “I will execute judgments,” and then adds, “I am Hashem,” [to indicate that Hashem did it Himself]. If so, on the verse “Hashem struck down every first-born” (v. 29), why does Rashi comment: “He @ITand@it His Divine court”? The answer is: Since He Himself was striking, it was not considered through an agent even though His Divine court was with Him.<QC>
@p1[14]@p2<TIE>For [future] generations.@p3 Rashi explains this so we will not make a mistake and say that “for you” means only for this generation. Although it is written afterwards, “Throughout your generations,” thus Rashi did not really need to explain this, he did so to connect it to @hh<HEB>וחגותם אתו@ee<ENG>. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1@p2Which day is the day of remembrance.@p3 This is because the Torah previously mentioned [several dates on which significant events occurred:] the first of Nisan, the tenth, and the fourteenth.<QC>
@p1@p2The Torah therefore says: “As a statute forever shall you celebrate it.”@p3 We need not ask: Now [that it says “forever”], why do we need “throughout your generations”? The answer is: Otherwise, I would think it is an eternal statute for this generation to celebrate it every year, but not for future generations. Therefore, both phrases are necessary. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1[15]@p2<TIE>This teaches that on the seventh day of Pesach it is not obligatory to eat @BImatzoh.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because of what is written in Devarim 16:8 [at the end of the verse of “Six days shall you eat @ITmatzos@it]: “And on the seventh day shall be a festival to Hashem your God.” If there was an obligation to eat @ITmatzoh@it on the seventh day, it should say expressly, “And on the seventh day @ITyou shall eat matzos@it and it shall be a festival.” This would be needed since that verse begins, “@ITSix days@it shall you eat @ITmatzos@it,” hinting not on the seventh — thus we would think that the seventh day is an exception to the rule of eating @ITmatzoh@it. Therefore, [since at the end of the verse the seventh day is mentioned as being a festival while@IT matzoh@it is omitted,] the verse is teaching [in the format of @hh<HEB>דבר שהיה בכלל ויצא מן הכלל ללמד@ee<ENG>] that the seventh day is a festival alone, without an obligation to eat @ITmatzoh@it. We need not ask: Why is it not written, “In the evening you shall eat @ITmatzoh;@it for seven days do not eat @ITchometz@it”? And then we would know that @ITmatzoh@it is obligatory on the first night, and optional for the remaining seven days. The answer is: We would then think that the verse means to start eating @ITmatzoh@it in the evening, and continue eating it all seven days in place of eating @ITchometz@it. (See @ITRe”m@it for further elaboration; what appears here is sufficient to understand Rashi.) @p1@p2Something that was included in a general rule and was singled out.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 The Rashbam explains (Pesachim 120a) that the seventh day was included in [the general rule of our verse,] “You must eat @ITmatzos@it for seven days.” But it was singled out in Devarim: “And on the seventh day shall be a festival to Hashem your God.” For there, “you shall eat @ITmatzos@it” is not mentioned. This teaches about itself: on the seventh day, @ITmatzoh@it is merely optional. From this method we derive that it was singled out not only to teach about itself; rather, to teach something new concerning the rule as a whole. (@ITRe”m@it rejects this approach and explains it differently; [see previous entry].) @p1@p2Therefore, the Torah states: “In the evening you shall eat matzos.”@p3 As Rashi explains (Pesachim 28b), the verse of “In the evening you shall eat @ITmatzos@it” would be superfluous, [if not to establish eating @ITmatzos@it on the first night as an obligation for all generations]. For it already said (v. 8), “They shall eat it [the @ITkorbon Pesach@it] with matzos and bitter herbs,” [which teaches us the obligation of @ITmatzoh@it in the time of the @ITBeis Hamikdash@it]. And [as regards eating @ITmatzoh@it as something optional,] the first night is already included in our verse, “You must eat matzos for seven days,” since “days” includes the nights, as we learn from, “Until the twenty-first day of the month” (v. 18).<QC>
@p1@p2When [that soul] has its full faculties and knowledge.@p3 I.e., one who transgresses intentionally. The @ITMechilta@it states this clearly. @p1@p2The word @HB<HEB>מקרא@BO<ENG> is an infinitive.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 It means declaring holiness. I.e., you shall declare it holy with regard to [wearing] special clothing, eating, and drinking. But @hh<HEB>מקרא@ee<ENG> should not be explained as an adjective, meaning that the day is declared holy by Hashem. For then, it should have said @hh<HEB>היום@ee<ENG> (the day) rather than @hh<HEB>ביום@ee<ENG> (on the day).<QC>
@p1@p2It, but not the preparations for it.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because it says @hh<HEB>הוא@ee<ENG>, which implies only the work itself but not the preparations. Yet it also says @hh<HEB>לכם@ee<ENG>, which implies that [work may be done for] all your needs, [including the preparations]. How is this [self-contradictory verse to be explained]? Where only the work itself is permitted, is when the preparations can be done before Yom Tov. And where even the preparations are permitted, is when the preparations cannot be done before Yom Tov. @p1@p2Even for an animal. You might think for non-Jews as well.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo You might ask: Perhaps the opposite is true, [i.e., for non-Jews it is permitted and for animals it is not]? The answer is: It is more logical to include [our domesticated] animals in the permission to do work, for they are dependent on us [i.e., we are responsible] to feed them, and to exclude non-Jews, for they are not dependent on us [i.e., we are not responsible] to feed them. @p1[17]@p2<TIE>If it has begun to rise, pat it with cold moisture.@bo I.e., when dough merely begins to rise, this does not make it into @ITchametz.@it Nevertheless, if the @ITmatzoh@it begins to rise and is on its way to become @ITchametz@it, [the woman kneading it] should place her hands in cold water and smear the surface of the dough to cool it down. This is [not because of the prohibition to eat @ITchametz,@it rather] because of the obligation of “You must be vigilant.” @p1@p2Do not read it the@BI matzos@BO, but rather, the@BI mitzvos@BO.@p3 [Rashi offers this midrashic explanation because] according to its simple meaning, [explained in the previous entry,] the verse is out of place. It should come right after (v. 15), “You must eat matzos for seven days,” and teach that we must vigilantly guard them from becoming @ITchametz@it. The Torah separated these two verses with other laws, to indicate that “You must be vigilant” is not limited to @ITmatzos@it. (@ITDevek Tov@it) @p1[18]@p2<TIE>Why is this said.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 You might ask: Does this verse not imply that eating @ITmatzoh@it is obligatory for all seven days, yet before, Rashi clearly explained that for all seven days it is optional? The answer is: Rashi indeed said before that eating @ITmatzoh@it is optional, as that was the verse’s subject. But here, the subject is the removal of leaven from the home, as is seen in the following verse, “For seven days no leaven may be found in your homes.” And when Rashi mentioned “seven days,” he was not referring to: “You must eat@IT matzos@it for seven days” (v. 15), rather he was referring to: “For seven days no leaven may be found” (v. 19). And if it said only, “Seven days no leaven may be found,” I might think that this applies only during the daytime, but not at night. (See @ITRe”m@it for further elaboration.) @p1[19]@p2<TIE>From where do we know [that this applies] to [your properties] outside your house?@bo “Your boundaries” (v. 13:7) comes [to extend the prohibition to areas] outside the house, such as in the fields and vineyards, [although houses are included in “your boundaries”]. @p1@p2A non-Jew’s @BIchametz@BO which is by a Jew.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo I.e., the Jew does not transgress the prohibition of having @ITchametz@it. Also the prohibition of “your boundaries” (v. 13:7) applies only when you have rights to the @ITchametz,@it as is learned from “in your homes.” This is because “in your homes” would otherwise be superfluous, [since homes are included in “your boundaries”]. Thus, “in your homes” comes to exclude [cases where the Jew has no rights to the @ITchametz,@it such as] a non-Jew’s @ITchametz@it stored by a Jew. @p1@p2But has it not already provided for the @BIkares@BO punishment regarding @BIchametz@BO?!@p3 Rashi is saying that the prohibition on @hh<HEB>שאור@ee<ENG> may be derived through @ITa fortiori@it reasoning, as follows: @hh<HEB>חמץ@ee<ENG> is not so strongly leavened that it can ferment other dough. Nevertheless, one who eats it is liable for @ITkares@it. Then regarding @hh<HEB>שאור@ee<ENG>, which is strongly leavened, all the more so that one who eats it should be liable for @ITkares@it.<QC>
@p1[20]@p2<TIE>This is the warning against the eating of yeast.@bo For the punishment was already learned from (v. 19), “Whoever eats @ITchametz@it that soul shall be cut off.<TIE>.<TIE>..” @p1@p2Includes its mixture.@bo @ITRe”m@it discussed Rashi’s comment at length and found difficulty with it. But see Maseches Chulin 43a, and the commentary of Rashi and Tosafos there (beginning with @hh<HEB>והא אמר רבי יוחנן@ee<ENG>), discussing the Mishnah of @hh<HEB>אלו כשרות@ee<ENG>. @ITRe”m@it found difficulty with Rashi only because he overlooked this. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1@p2This comes to teach.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: It is obvious [that the mitzvah of @ITmatzoh@it applies in all places], for @ITmatzoh@it is an obligation upon the person, [not upon the land], and therefore applies both in Eretz Yisrael and outside it. Rashi answers: “This comes to teach.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1@p2This excludes @BIMaaser Sheni @BOand the breads of the thanksgiving @BIkorbon@BO.@p3 Rashi is saying that even if these were eaten in Jerusalem one cannot fulfill his obligation of eating @ITmatzoh@it — since they may not be eaten “in all your dwellings.”<QC>
@p1[21]@p2<TIE>Whoever owns lambs shall draw one of his own.@p3 Why does Rashi not explain this as he did above (v. 6), “Withdraw your hands from idol worship”? The answer is: Above, Rashi was not explaining the meaning of the verse, but the reason for the mitzvah. For that, a midrashic explanation is sufficient. But here Rashi is explaining the meaning of the verse; thus he offers its simple meaning (@ITRe”m@it) @p1[22]@p2<TIE>Three stalks are called a bunch.@p3 I.e., we should not explain that five stalks are needed. See Tosafos, Maseches Succah 13a. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it)<QC>
@p1@p2This teaches that once dominion is given to the destroyer.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo This is not referring to the destroyer of the Egyptians, as every first-born was smitten although he did not step outside. Rather it is referring to the destroyer that comes out every night, as Rashi proceeds to explain, “Night is when the destroying angels have dominion.” The B’nei Yisrael were commanded not to go out this night in particular — although all nights have the same danger — so the Egyptians would not say, “Just as we were smitten, they were also smitten,” and then they would say that Moshe is a liar. For they would not know that the regular destroyer did it, whereas Moshe was speaking of the special destroyer who smote the Egyptian first-born.<QC>
@p1[27]@p2<TIE>For the foretelling of the redemption.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi inferred that there were three reasons for being thankful because it is written, @hh<HEB>ויקוד העם וישתחוו@ee<ENG>, “they bowed (singular) and prostrated themselves (plural).” The verse should have simply said @hh<HEB>ויקדו@ee<ENG> (and they bowed, plural), similar to @hh<HEB>וישתחוו@ee<ENG> (which is plural). Thus, the verse’s wording indicates that there was one bowing and two prostrations. (@ITMaharshal@it)<QC>
@p1[28]@p2<TIE>In order to relate the praise.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [For they did it] even though it was dangerous to slaughter Egypt’s god in front of their eyes. @p1@p2Moshe and Aharon, too, did so.@bo [This needed to be stated] otherwise we might think: Moshe and Aharon were not commanded because they did not need to be redeemed; and therefore they did not do so. Thus, the additional phrase of “They [also] did so” teaches us [that Moshe and Aharon also did it.] Otherwise it would be sufficient to say, “The B’nei Yisrael went and did.” @p1[29]@p2<TIE>Wherever it states.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 It is written (Bereishis 19:24), “@ITAnd@it Hashem made sulfur and fire rain down.” There, @ITRe”m@it explained that wherever it says “@ITand@it Hashem,” it means “He and His Divine court,” and enumerated other places where it says, “@ITand@it Hashem.”<QC>
@p1@p2Because they rejoiced at the misfortune of the Israelites.@bo See above (v. 11:5) for an explanation why two reasons are needed. @p1[30]@p2<TIE>This teaches us that he made the rounds.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo Why did Pharaoh’s servants not wake him up? The plague was mainly on them, as it is written, “For there was no house.<TIE>.<TIE>.” The answer is: They had already said, “Send these men out.<TIE>.<TIE>. do you not yet realize.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (v. 10:7), but Pharaoh did not listen to them. Therefore [they despaired of persuading him and] he needed to wake them. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it)<QC>
@p1@p2An alternate explanation: The Egyptian women were unfaithful.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 This raises a difficulty: Now too, the Egyptians will say that Moshe is a liar, for sons who are not first-born were dying. The answer is: Moshe will tell them that they are all first-born because the women were unfaithful. And all this was in order to show the Egyptians’ lowliness and impurity. (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1@p2And bore children from single, unmarried men.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is explaining that @hh<HEB>רווקים@ee<ENG> means @hh<HEB>פנוים@ee<ENG> (unmarried). @p1[31]@p2<TIE>This tells us that he went.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Otherwise it should say, “He called @hh<HEB>אל משה@ee<ENG>, as it does in “Hashem called @hh<HEB>אל משה@ee<ENG> (@ITto@it Moshe) and spoke to him.” But @hh<HEB>למשה@ee<ENG> means, “@ITfor@it Moshe.”<QC>
@p1[32]@p2<TIE>Pray for me that I do not die, for I am a first-born.@p3 Otherwise, why would Pharaoh need their blessing, since he sent the people out [and consequently needed not fear further plagues]? @p1[34]@p2<TIE>The Egyptians did not let them procrastinate long enough to become @BIchametz@BO.@p3 But [the reason they took it before it was leavened] was not on account of the prohibition against @ITchametz@it, because for the Pesach in Egypt there was no prohibition against having @ITchametz@it in the home. Alternatively, Rashi’s comment may be understood as follows. He is answering the question: Why is it written, “Before it was @ITleavened@it”? It should have said, “Before they baked it.” Therefore Rashi explains: “The Egyptians did not let them.<TIE>.<TIE>.” I.e., by writing “Before it was @ITleavened@it,” the Torah is informing us the extent to which the Egyptians were hurrying B’nei Yisrael. @p1@p2What was left of their @BImatzoh@BO and @BImaror@BO.@p3 But not what was left of the @ITkorbon@it @ITPesach@it, because any leftovers from the @ITkorbon Pesach@it must be burned. [see 12:10] @p1[35]@p2<TIE>These were even dearer to them than silver and gold.@p3 Otherwise, why should “clothing” even be mentioned? If they lent them silver and gold, surely clothing. Thus we [must say: on the contrary,] “these were even dearer.<TIE>.<TIE>.” However, the @ITMaharshal@it explains: Since Hashem did not command them to borrow clothing, perforce it was not so valuable. Hashem said to request only silver and gold, to uphold His promise of, “Afterwards they will leave with great wealth.” They borrowed the clothing on their own, since a pauper who lacks clothing does not look to acquire silver and gold, but coats and shirts. And what does it mean that the clothing was even dearer to the Egyptians? It means that it was a great and serious matter for the Egyptians to lend it to them. This is because the Egyptian clothing and customs were different from those of B’nei Yisrael, so when they lent them clothing they knew it would not be returned since B’nei Yisrael would make alterations to the clothing. Nevertheless, they lent it to them. Therefore Rashi explains that the clothing was “even dearer @ITto them@it,” i.e., to the Egyptians, but not to B’nei Yisrael. Whereas the silver and gold was not as dear to the Egyptians, since they thought it would be returned. @p1@p2The later in the verse, the dearer.@bo This raises a difficulty: In the verse mentioning “Wheat and barley” (Devarim 8:8), the more important item comes first. The answer is: [Rashi is not stating a general rule. And] here, the more important item cannot be the first one, as then the latter items would not need to be mentioned at all. For if the Egyptians lent the valuable items, surely they would lend the cheap ones. (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1[36]@p2<TIE>Even that which they did not request of them.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo [Rashi knows this] because at first it is written, “And they requested of the Egyptians” (v. 35), and then it is written, “Hashem granted the people favor,” telling us that they found favor, and their request was granted. If so, why does Scripture need to write here, “And they granted their request”? It must come to tell you that they gave them even things that they did not request. @p1[37]@p2<TIE>[The distance between them was] 120 @BImil@BO.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because Scripture did not need to write, “From Ramseis,” since we already know that they were in Ramseis, as it is written in Parshas Vayigash (Bereishis 47:11). Thus, “From Ramseis” is mentioned only to tell us that they traveled a distance of 120 @ITmil@it in a moment. @p1@p2Who were twenty years and older.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because in Parshas Bamidbar, the males are counted from twenty years and older, and the number is similar to this one — and both counts were taken within one year. We cannot suggest that here they were counted from thirteen years old, because then the count in Parshas Bamidbar would be less, as they would not all turn twenty within one year. Thus, the count here must have been from twenty years and older. @p1[39]@p2<TIE>This is what is explicitly told in the Prophets.@p3 The word @hh<HEB>קבלה@ee<ENG> refers to the Prophets.<QC>
@p1[40]@p2<TIE>And thirty years passed from when the decree of “between the pieces” was decreed.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 @ITRe”m@it explains in Parshas Lech Lecha that Avraham was seventy at the decree of “between the pieces,” and so it says in @ITSeder Olam.@it<QC>
@p1[42]@p2<TIE>It is continuously protected from destructive forces.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: What does “this night remains a vigil for all generations” mean? Surely, this actual night of the Exodus does not remain forever. Rashi answers: “It is continuously protected.” I.e., every year when this night comes, it is protected from destructive forces. @p1[43]@p2<TIE>This section was told to them on the 14th of Nissan.@p3 For if it was told on the first of the month, it should have been written above with (v. 12:2), “This month shall be [reckoned] to you,” if they were both stated at the same time. @p1[45]@p2<TIE>A circumcised Arab.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 See @ITRe”m,@it who discusses Rashi’s comments on @hh<HEB>תושב ושכיר@ee<ENG> at length, and reconciles them with what is stated in the Gemara. @p1[46]@p2<TIE>From this [we infer] that whoever eats it may eat it in two places.@p3 You might ask: How does Rashi know [that in this verse, “house” means “group,” whereas in the earlier verse (v. 7), it means “place”]? Perhaps it is the opposite: @hh<HEB>בבית אחד יאכל@ee<ENG> means as it sounds, [and “house” means “place.” Thus, they shall not continue eating it in a different @ITplace@it from where they started]. And @hh<HEB>על הבתים אשר יאכלו אותו בהם@ee<ENG> (v.7) teaches that the @ITgroup@it is allowed to break up [before they start eating,] and eat it separately in two different houses. @ITRe”m@it answers: Since our verse is vocalized @hh<HEB>יֵאָכֵל@ee<ENG> (@ITit@it must be eaten), perforce it refers to the @ITkorbon Pesach@it. [This way the emphasis is on the @ITkorbon Pesach@it itself, teaching that it must remain in one group, although the eaters themselves may move from place to place, as long as they stay as one group]. For if it was referring to [the @ITeater@it of the @ITkorbon@it @ITPesach@it, that he shall not move from house to] house, then it would be vocalized @hh<HEB>יֹאכַל@ee<ENG> (@IThe@it must eat it). Then it would mean that its members shall eat it in one house [and shall not continue eating in a different place, even if they stay as one group]. @p1@p2[A bone] that is edible as, for example.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo Rashi is explaining that @hh<HEB>יֵאָכֵל@ee<ENG> refers also to the prohibition of breaking bones. It is as if Scripture had written, “A bone that may be eaten, you must not break.” (@ITRe”m@it) @p1[47]@p2<TIE>The Torah tells us: “The entire community of Yisrael.”@p3 I.e., even if they are not from the same family [they may make a group]. @p1[49]@p2<TIE>Regarding the other @BImitzvos @BOof the Torah.@p3 You might ask: Why should we think converts are different? They are full Jews! Granted that the previous verse needed to equate the convert to the native born regarding bringing the @ITkorbon Pesach@it on the 14th of Nisan, since we might have thought that he brings the @ITkorbon Pesach@it right when he converts. Thus it is written, “Like the native born,” as Rashi explained. But why should converts be different regarding the other @ITmitzvos@it of the Torah? The answer is: The fact that the Torah needed to equate them regarding the @ITkorbon@it @ITPesach@it on the fourteenth [of Nisan] might have led us to say that they are different regarding other @ITmitzvos.@it (@ITRe”m@it) @p1[2]@p2<TIE>That is the first to open the womb.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Does not every infant open the womb [through its birth]? Thus he explains, “The @ITfirst@it to open.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1@p2I have acquired them for Myself.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Does not everything in the world belong to Him? Thus Rashi explains, “I have [already] acquired them for Myself.” I.e., every firstborn is holy even without your sanctifying it. Nevertheless, “Sanctify to Me all the first-born” in order to receive reward. @p1[3]@p2<TIE>This teaches that mention of the Exodus from Egypt should be made every day.@p3 [@ITRe”m@it explains that Rashi knows this because] @hh<HEB>זכור@ee<ENG> is written with a @hh<HEB>קמץ@ee<ENG>, therefore it implies a constant remembering, as Rashi explains in Parshas Yisro, on “Remember the Shabbos day” (20:8). There, the @ITNachalas Yaakov@it disagrees at length with @ITRe”m@it, and concludes: It seems to me that Rashi derived the mentioning of the Exodus every day from the word @hh<HEB>הזה@ee<ENG> (this). For the verse could have [omitted @hh<HEB>הזה@ee<ENG> and] said simply, “Remember the day on which you came out from Egypt,” as the Torah says in: “In order that you shall remember the day on which you came out from Egypt” (Devarim 16:3). Therefore, when this verse says @hh<HEB>היום הזה@ee<ENG>, this implies that every day should be to you as if you left Egypt today, similar to: “On @ITthis@it day you have become a nation (ibid 27:10),” on which Rashi explains: “Every day should be to you as if today you entered the covenant.” Deriving the mention of the Exodus from @hh<HEB>היום הזה@ee<ENG> fits well [with Maseches Berachos 12b, which states that] only at daytime would we mention the Exodus, [if not for the extra verse in Devarim 16:3 which teaches to mention it also at night]. This is understandable if we learn from @hh<HEB>היום הזה@ee<ENG>, as the Exodus itself was during the daytime. But if we learn from @hh<HEB>זכור@ee<ENG>, which implies constant remembering, [and thus it includes the nighttime as well, there is no need for an extra verse].<QC>
@p1[5]@p2<TIE>Who had no other name except “Canaanite.”@bo Rashi is answering the question: Elsewhere, where all seven nations are enumerated, why is Canaan mentioned with them? There, it is unnecessary for Canaan to be mentioned in order to include other nations. Thus Rashi explains: “One among the family of Canaan.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (@ITRe”m@it) Alternatively, Rashi is answering the question: Since all seven nations are included in “Canaan,” why did it need to say, “the Chittites, the Emorites.<TIE>.<TIE>.”? Just saying “Canaanite” should have sufficed. Rashi answers that one nation had no other name, thus if it would be written only “Canaanite” we would think [it means only that nation, and] the other nations were not included. Thus it is written “Canaanite” — and afterwards, “the Chittites, the Emorites.<TIE>.<TIE>.” so that we will ask why are only five nations enumerated. And then we will be compelled to answer that they are all included in “Canaanite.” @p1@p2Hashem made a covenant with Avram.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo You might ask: It says in Parshas Va’eira (6:3), “I revealed Myself to Avraham.<TIE>.<TIE>. as Almighty Shaddai, but My Name Ad-noy I did not make known to them.” [Thus, how could Hashem have used the Name Ad-noy to swear to Avram]? The answer is: Hashem gave Avram mere good tidings, [without yet keeping the promise. Whereas v. 6:3 means: “I was not recognized by them by My attribute of @ITkeeping@it trust,”] as explained there by Rashi. You might ask: If so, [that it was mere good tidings,] where did Hashem swear to Avram? The answer is: [It was good tidings accompanied by an oath. For] Hashem twice stated to Avram His words of promise, and this repetition constitutes an oath. For example it says, “As I swore regarding the floodwaters of Noach” (Yeshayah 54:10), regarding which Rashi comments in Parshas Noach (Bereishis 8:21), “We find in Scripture no oath regarding this, except for His repeating His words regarding this.” Rashi is referring to the words @hh<HEB>לא אוסיף@ee<ENG> which are written twice in that verse.<QC>
@p1[8]@p2<TIE>Because I will fulfill His @BImitzvos, @BOsuch as.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because it is written @hh<HEB>זה@ee<ENG>, which implies that the father is pointing to something specific [when speaking] to his son. @p1@p2This is an allusion to a response to the evil son.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 You might ask: Why is the allusion to the response to the evil son here, in the middle of what is actually the response to the son who does not know what to ask, [as Rashi says (v. 5)]? The answer is: The message alluded to the evil son applies also to the son who does not know what to ask. The message is that Hashem performed the miracles only for the righteous who know the Torah. The ignorant people did not have the merit for these miracles, and were not worthy on their own to be redeemed, only through the merit of the righteous. We need not ask: [If the alluded message applies to the son who does not know what to ask,] perhaps the whole response is for him alone. How do we know that there is an allusion to a response to the evil son? The answer is: Since it is written “for me,” it implies for me and not for him. I.e., he would not have been redeemed at all. This must refer to the evil son, since the son who does not know what to ask would indeed have been redeemed in the merit of the righteous. However, the evil son would have died during the three days of darkness.<QC>
@p1[9]@p2<TIE>The weak hand.@p3 @hh<HEB>כהה@ee<ENG> means “dark,” i.e., the right hand is more important than the left hand [which is called “dark”]. @p1[11]@p2<TIE>I will bring you to the land about which I raised My hand.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Above, it is written that Hashem swore to your fathers (v. 5), while here it is written, “He swore to you.” This implies that Hashem swore twice, once to your fathers, and once to you. The oath that was to you is in the verse “I will bring @ITyou@it to the land about which I raised My Hand.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (6:8), for the beginning of that section deals with the oath to the fathers, and then concludes, “Therefore say to the B’nei Yisrael.<TIE>.<TIE>.” which Rashi explains as, “In accordance with that oath.” If so, why did it repeat, “To the land about which I raised My hand [as an oath]”? Thus we must say that the second oath was to the B’nei Yisrael. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) However, @ITRe”m@it explains [differently]: “He swore to you” in this verse means that He swore for your sake. The oath was made to your fathers, but sometimes it is called the oath of the children since the oath was for their sake. @p1@p2You should consider it as if He had given it to you on the same day.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Is it not superfluous to say, “He will have given it to you”? Once He brings you to the land, surely He will have given it to you. Thus Rashi says: “You should consider it.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1[12]@p2<TIE>Should you ask: does it refer also to a first-born of an unclean animal?@p3 In other words, you might suggest that @hh<HEB>שגר@ee<ENG> in this verse does not refer to one prematurely born, just as@hh<HEB>שגר אלפיך@ee<ENG> does not. Even though it is already written, “Every one that [is first to] open the womb,” [apparently forcing us to say that @hh<HEB>שגר@ee<ENG> refers to one prematurely born, you might suggest:] perhaps @hh<HEB>שגר@ee<ENG> comes to include the first-born of an unclean animal. @p1@p2There is a possible alternate explanation.@p3 And according to this explanation, @hh<HEB>שגר@ee<ENG> does not refer to one prematurely born. @p1[13]@p2<TIE>This is a Scriptural decree.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 As stated in the first chapter of Bechoros (5a). Rashi added his own explanation by saying, “Because the Egyptian first-born.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1@p2The sheep is not sacred in the possession of the @BIkohein@BO.@p3 [Rashi is explaining that] the sheep does not become forbidden to be used, in place of the firstling donkey [which becomes permitted to be used]. Rather, the sheep is ordinary property and the @ITkohein@it may use it as he wishes.<QC>
@p1[16]@p2<TIE>@HB<HEB>טט@BO<ENG> in the Kathphi language is @BItwo.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Katheph is the name of a place where “two” is called @hh<HEB>טט@ee<ENG>. Similarly, Afrik is the name of a place where “two” is called @hh<HEB>פת@ee<ENG>. See Tosafos in Maseches Sanhedrin (4b). Rashi was answering the question: Here it is written @hh<HEB>ולטטפות@ee<ENG>, while in the section of @ITkadeish@it (v. 9) it is written @hh<HEB>ולזכרון@ee<ENG>. Why are different words used [to describe @ITtephillin@it]? To answer this, Rashi cited this explanation [about Kathphi and Afriki]. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) You might ask: According to this, @ITtephillin@it should contain twelve compartments, since “@ITtotafos” @itis written three times. The answer is: One instance of “@ITtotafos@it” is needed for itself, [to tell us the mitzvah]. Another teaches “two” (compartments) in the Kathphi language, or “two” in the Afriki language. The third “@ITtotafos@it” teaches that in Kathphi four (compartments) are needed, or in Afriki four (compartments) are needed; if “@ITtotafos”@it were only written twice, then only two compartments would be needed. Another answer is: @IT“Totafos@it” is not written three times for the sake of [new] commands. Rather, [the section of @ITtephillin@it is] like a section that has been stated once and then repeated, just as many other sections of the Torah [are repeated in whole, for the sake of a certain new teaching that the repetition contains].<QC>
@p1[17]@p2<TIE>Lead them.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 The @hh<HEB>ם@ee<ENG> of @hh<HEB>נחם@ee<ENG> is a suffix, not the third letter of the verb root. The word means “lead,” and not “rest” (@hh<HEB>מנוח@ee<ENG>) or “consolation” (@hh<HEB>נחמה@ee<ENG>). @p1@p2And it was therefore easy to return by that route to Egypt.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Every @hh<HEB>כי@ee<ENG> in Scripture is put there to give a reason. How does [“Because it was the shortest route”] give a reason for the preceding [statement that Hashem did @ITnot@it lead them that way]? On the contrary, Hashem should lead them via the shortest route! Thus Rashi explains that it was easy to return by that route, as it says afterwards, “For Elohim said.<TIE>.<TIE>.” I.e., what would cause them to return to Egypt? “Elohim said.<TIE>.<TIE>. should they encounter war.” The war would be the cause [for them to return]. @p1@p2There are many Midrashic explanations@bo.@p3 I.e., they give different explanations for, “Because it was the shortest route.” Accordingly, “Elohim said.<TIE>.<TIE>.” does not refer to, “Because it was the shortest route.” It rather refers to, “Elohim did not lead them.<TIE>.<TIE>..” It is giving an additional reason why Elohim did not lead them: “Because Elohim said.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1@p2For example, the war of: “And the Amaleikites and Canaanites.<TIE>.<TIE>.”@p3 [mentioned in Bamidbar 14:45. Rashi is saying] that it does not mean war in general. For they encountered war with the Amaleikites [Shemos 17:8, yet did not return to Egypt]. Although they defeated Amaleik, they were close to Egypt and could have returned, from fear of other wars. (@ITRe”m,@it based on Mechilta) But the @ITMaharshal@it explains: Rashi did not mention the nearby war with Amaleik (17:8) because Israel defeated Amaleik then. So there was little concern that they would set their hearts to return to Egypt. But in the war of “the Amaleikites came down,” Yisrael was stricken and smitten. Thus, there was concern that they would return. @p1@p2They said, “Let us appoint a leader and let us return to Egypt”.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is saying that the reason they did not return was because they lacked a leader. It was a long route and required a leader. But were they to have a leader, they clearly would return — despite their distance from Egypt. So if they had a short and straight route back to Egypt, not requiring a leader, they surely would return. @ITMaharshal@it explains: Although they traveled a round-about route they still said, “Let us appoint a leader and let us return,” after merely hearing about Amaleik from their scouts. So had they taken a straight route, and encountered actual war, they surely would have returned all the way. @p1@p2Have second thoughts.@p3 @hh<HEB>ינחם@ee<ENG> means changing one’s mind. This follows Rashi’s second explanation on Bereishis 6:6. However, in Rashi’s first explanation there, it means “consolation.” @p1[18]@p2<TIE>@HB<HEB>סוף@BO<ENG> is a term meaning a marsh.@p3 [Rashi is saying] that we should not think @hh<HEB>סוף@ee<ENG> means “end,” in which case it would mean, “They traveled to the end of the sea.” Thus he explains, “@hh<HEB>סוף@ee<ENG> is a term meaning a marsh,” i.e., a sea full of reeds. Therefore the meaning of @hh<HEB>ים סוף@ee<ENG> here is as if it were written @hb<HEB>ל@hhים סוף@ee<ENG>. (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1@p2An alternate explanation.<TIE>.<TIE>. one of every five went out.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 There is a question on the first explanation: What is the proof [from “You shall pass by with arms”]? In the context of that verse, there is no other way to explain @hh<HEB>חמושים@ee<ENG>. Therefore Rashi presents the alternate explanation. And he also presents [the first explanation] so that the verse does not depart from its simple meaning [completely], and @hh<HEB>חמושים@ee<ENG> has the [simple] meaning of “armed.” @p1[19]@p2<TIE>Swear that they will make their children swear.@bo [How does Rashi know this? The answer is:] It cannot be that [the repetitive @hh<HEB>השבע השביע@ee<ENG> is merely because] the Torah speaks as people do, [and the oath was for Yoseif’s generation alone]. For how is it possible that Yoseif’s generation would leave Egypt? They needed to be in Egypt for 400 years, or at least for 210! Furthermore, [if Yoseif’s oath was for that generation alone,] how would [we explain the word @hh<HEB>כי@ee<ENG>? I.e., how would] the oath be the reason [for Moshe to take along Yoseif’s bones]? Perforce, “He made them swear that they will make their children swear.” This is preferable to @ITRe”m’s@it explanation. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1@p2Why did he not bind his sons by oath.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo Meaning: And then he would not need to make them swear to make their children swear. Rashi answers, “Yoseif said: ‘I was a ruler in Egypt.<TIE>.<TIE>.’” This, explains why Rashi asked his question on the verse rather than on his explanation of it. [It is because the repetitive @hh<HEB>השבע השביע@ee<ENG> clearly shows that Yoseif made them swear to make their children swear.] Furthermore, [this explains] why Rashi did not ask this question in Bereishis 50:25, where the oath itself is stated. [It is because Rashi’s question arises only due to the words @hh<HEB>השבע השביע@ee<ENG>]. (@ITDevek Tov@it)<QC>
@p1@p2It was his brothers that he bound by this oath.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo [Rashi is saying that here,] “B’nei Yisrael” means Yaakov’s sons. And the meaning of “Elohim will surely remember @ITyou@it” is that He will remember @ITyour children@it, who are in your place. Otherwise, [if Yoseif was not speaking to his brothers,] why would it say @hh<HEB>אתכם@ee<ENG>? Therefore Rashi explains that Yoseif bound his brothers by this oath, and @hh<HEB>אתכם@ee<ENG> is referring to his brothers’ bones. Thus, the verse means as follows: “Elohim will surely remember @ITyou@it,” i.e., “your children.” “You must carry up” is Yoseif’s command [to his brothers]: Make your children swear to carry my bones up with yours. @p1[21]@p2<TIE>Here, too, @BIto lead them @BOby means of an agent.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., @hh<HEB>לנחותם@ee<ENG> is a transitive verb involving a secondary object [i.e., the “agent”]. Rashi proves this from @hh<HEB>לַראתכם@ee<ENG> (Devarim 1:33), which must be the same as @hh<HEB>להראותכם@ee<ENG> (to show), for otherwise it would be like @hh<HEB>לִראותכם@ee<ENG> in the simple verb form, and mean “to see you.” But this meaning would not fit into the context of the verse. Perforce, it is the same as @hh<HEB>להראותכם@ee<ENG>. Here too, @hh<HEB>לַנחותם@ee<ENG> means the same as @hh<HEB>להנחותם@ee<ENG> (to lead them). (This is not in accordance with @ITRe”m@it’s explanation.) @p1@p2Hashem Himself, in His glory, led it before them.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Is it not written, “@ITHashem@it went before them,” not the pillar of cloud? Thus Rashi explains that Hashem Himself led the pillar of cloud before them. We need not ask: If Hashem went before them, why was the pillar of cloud needed? For Rashi explains: “Nevertheless, He provided the pillar of cloud to lead them by its means.<TIE>.<TIE>..” @BOThe pillar of cloud was not providing light, but rather to show them the way.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because during the day they do not need light. Perforce, it showed them the way. When Scripture writes, “To provide them with light,” it refers only to the pillar of fire. However, the pillar of fire also showed them the way, as it is written, “So that they could travel by day and by night.” (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1[22]@p2<TIE>Hashem [did not remove] the pillar of cloud by day.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because @hh<HEB>ימיש@ee<ENG> is a causative verb. Otherwise, [if it meant “the cloud did not depart”], it should be vocalized @hh<HEB>יִמּוֹשׁ@ee<ENG>.<QC>
@p1@p2Before one would depart the other would arrive.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because otherwise, why is [this verse of] @hh<HEB>לא ימיש@ee<ENG> necessary? [The previous verse] already said, “Hashem went.<TIE>.<TIE>. in a pillar of cloud.<TIE>.<TIE>. and at night in a pillar of fire.” @p1[2]@p2<TIE>Is Pisom@BI.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo@it [Rashi knows this] because the verse comes to tell us at which border they encamped, yet we do not know of Pi Hachiros, for it is not mentioned in Scripture. Thus, it must be Pisom. @p1@p2Because there they became free men.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 It is called Pisom, an acronym for “@ITPeh sasum@it” (sealed mouth). This is because an idol was there which did not allow any slave to escape. But now they became free men there, because Hashem altered Egypt’s ruling star in the heavens. So now [the place] was called Pi Hachiros, named after their attaining freedom (@ITcheirus@it). We need not ask: Why was it not now called Cheirus? And also, why was it not previously called Sasum@IT,@it rather than Pisom? For Rashi explains: “They were two high, upright rocks and the valley between them was like a mouth (@ITpeh@it).” @p1@p2It alone was left from all the gods of Egypt.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo I.e., this god was left even though it is written, “Against all the gods of Egypt, I will execute judgments” (12:12).<QC>
@p1[4]@p2<TIE>To relate their praises that they listened to Moshe.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Why is it not written, “They did just that,” for all mitzvos? Perforce, because it is obvious that they did just that. Therefore, it is obvious here as well! So Rashi explains, “To relate their praises.” I.e., Scripture testifies to their righteousness. But it seems to me [that Rashi is answering the question:] It says, “The Egyptians.<TIE>.<TIE>. overtook them as they were encamped by the sea.<TIE>.<TIE>. at Pi haChiros, facing Ba’al Tzephon” (v. 9). This proves they turned back. Therefore, “They did just that” is superfluous, and it is stated “to relate their praises.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1[5]@p2<TIE>He sent officials along with them.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Pharaoh willingly sent B’nei Yisrael out. He knew himself that they left Egypt. Why then does it say he was “told”? Perforce, “He sent officials.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1@p2On the fifth and sixth days they pursued them.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 You might ask: B’nei Yisrael journeyed on the first and second days, but on the third day they turned back a day’s journey, as it is written: “Have them turn back” (v. 2). Thus, they were only a day’s distance from Egypt. Why then did it take Pharaoh two days to overtake them? The answer is: “Have them turn back” means they traveled at an angle. Although Rashi says (ibid), “They kept moving nearer to Egypt,” it does not mean they went straight back [via the same route they had taken]. They were heading back on an indirect path, which is not a true returning. It demonstrated that they were in a state of confusion, for they did not return the way they came.  Had they not returned in a straying way, Pharaoh would not have pursued them, for he released them because he considered it Hashem’s will. But upon seeing them returning [in an apparently confused manner] convinced Pharaoh that if it was Hashem’s will, He would have led them on a straight path. @p1@p2In the morning they chanted the @BIshirah@BO and that was the seventh day of Pesach.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 You might ask: Did not Rashi say in Bamidbar 15:41 that they chanted the @ITshirah@it on the eighth day? The answer is: [It is the eighth day] if you count from @ITErev Pesach@it, which is when the @ITkorbon@it @ITPesach@it was slaughtered and its blood sprinkled on the lintel and doorposts. [True,] @ITErev Pesach@it is not a complete day, for the night had already passed before the slaughtering, and is not counted with the day. Nevertheless, it is considered a full day regarding sacrifices. This is because for sacrifices, the night @ITfollowing@it is considered part of the day. So when counting from the day of slaughtering, the seventh day of Pesach is actually the eighth day. In Bamidbar, Rashi is counting from the day of slaughtering, and here he is not. But @ITRe”m@it explains: Perhaps R. Moshe Hadarshan, who said it was the eighth day, disagrees with the Aggadah [cited here] which says they chanted the @ITshirah@it on the seventh day. @p1@p2Now they changed.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Some ask either way: If Pharaoh initially had in mind that B’nei Yisrael will leave Egypt and not come back, as Rashi explains that he now had a change of heart, why did he send along the officials? Rather, he must have had in mind that they will make a three-day festival in the wilderness and then come back, as the verse implies: “Go worship Hashem as you have said” (12:31). But if so, why does Rashi say he had a change of heart [if he thought all along that they will come back]? The answer is: Pharaoh initially sent B’nei Yisrael out regardless of whether or not they will come back. He sent the officers along with them so that if B’nei Yisrael were to decide to leave permanently, they should either give the officers the possessions, or come back and return what they had borrowed. This also explains why Rashi says they changed their minds “because of their property.” The officers saw that B’nei Yisrael intended to go away and flee, and they informed Pharaoh and his servants. Then Hashem gave them a change of heart, to bring B’nei Yisrael back to Egyptian slavery as before, although they initially did not have in mind that B’nei Yisrael will come back. @p1@p2To pursue them.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Question: How does Rashi know [that it was because of the property they lent them]? Perhaps it was as it is written in the verse: “How did we release B’nei Yisrael from@IT serving us@it?” The answer is: Indeed, this was Pharaoh’s reason, that because of the slave labor, he never wanted to send Israel away. But his servants were always telling him, “How long will this man be a menace to us” (10:7), etc, and now they said, “What have we done? How did we release Israel from@IT serving us@it?” Perforce, it was because of their property. Another answer: [Rashi knows this] because it is written “regarding the people,” implying: because of the people to whom they lent their property. (@ITMaharshal@it)<QC>
@p1[7]@p2<TIE>Selected.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Why does it not say @hh<HEB>בחורים@ee<ENG> (plural form)? The answer is: Had it said @hh<HEB>בחורים@ee<ENG> we would think [it meant “young men,”] as in Devarim (32:25), “The young man (@hh<HEB>בחור@ee<ENG>) and the young woman (@hh<HEB>בתולה@ee<ENG>)” — and it comes to exclude the elderly. Therefore it says @hh<HEB>בחור@ee<ENG> (singular form), which means “selected” — to convey that all the 600 chariots were select. And since @hh<HEB>בחור@ee<ENG> in fact refers to the 600, which is plural, Rashi writes [@hh<HEB>נבחרים@ee<ENG>] in the plural form. @p1@p2And along with them, all the remaining chariots.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: First it is written that Pharaoh took only 600 chariots. Why then is it written afterward, “All the chariots of Egypt”? Furthermore, once it is written, “All the chariots of Egypt,” why does it need to say, “600 chariots”? Thus Rashi explains, “Along with them.” In other words, Pharaoh took only 600. But those 600 [chariot commanders] had servants [with their own chariots,] and they also went along with Pharaoh, of their own accord.<QC>
@p1[10]@p2<TIE>An alternate explanation: And behold the Egyptian is coming.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 The angel is not called by a proper name but rather @hh<HEB>מצרים@ee<ENG>, because the guardian angel of Egypt is in fact named @hh<HEB>מצרים@ee<ENG>. @p1[11]@p2<TIE>Is it due to a lack of graves .<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi is answering the question:] Why did it not say @hh<HEB>המבלי קברים במצרים@ee<ENG> [without @hh<HEB>אין@ee<ENG>]? Thus Rashi explains: “Is it due to.<TIE>.<TIE>.”<QC>
@p1[12]@p2<TIE>Where was it that they told him? “Let Hashem look.<TIE>.<TIE>.”@bo Meaning: They said to Moshe, “Now we know that we then spoke correctly when we said, ‘Let Hashem look at you and judge’ (5:21). For according to what we see now, it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die now in the desert.” (@ITRe”m@it) @p1[13]@p2<TIE>This is the day that you saw them, but you will never again@bo. Rashi means: [You see them today] but you will not see them any other day [because I will destroy them]. And therefore I command you not to see them again [i.e., there is a command not to return to Egypt]. This is why Rashi adds a @hh<HEB>ו@ee<ENG> [to the verse, and says:] @hh<HEB>ולא תוסיפו@ee<ENG>. Otherwise [it would mean: “Because you saw the Egyptians this day, you will never again see them.” This cannot be,] for how is seeing the Egyptians this day a reason [for the command?] (@ITRe”m@it)  Everything @ITRe”m@it says seems contrary to logic. If “Never again see them” is a command, then the verse states two separate things. The first is that you have seen them only this day, and the second is the command not to see them again. Accordingly, there is no need to add a @hh<HEB>ו@ee<ENG> which means “and.” Rather, we must say it is not a command but a promise that “You will never again see them” because they will all drown in the sea. Also, most @ITPoskim@it do not consider this to be among the negative mitzvos. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1[15]@p2<TIE>An alternate explanation: Why do you cry out? @HB<HEB>אלי@BO<ENG> — This thing depends on Me.<TIE>.<TIE>.”@bo Explanation: The @ITtropp@it under @hh<HEB>תצעק@ee<ENG> is a @ITtipchah@it, showing that @hh<HEB>תצעק@ee<ENG> is not connected to @hh<HEB>אלי@ee<ENG>. This conveys that @hh<HEB>אלי@ee<ENG> means, “This thing depends on Me.” (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1@p2Because the sea will not stand in their way.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo Explanation: If B’nei Yisrael moves on, you can make the sea split by raising your staff. But if they do not move on, the sea will not split, although you raise your staff over it. This is because [raising your staff does not split the sea. Rather,] “The merit of their ancestors.<TIE>.<TIE>. is effective to split the sea for them.” Accordingly, “Why do you cry to Me” means as follows: Do not think @ITyou@it can accomplish the splitting of the sea through your prayers. Rather, “Let @ITthem@it move on” [and this will effect it]. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it; see there.)<QC>
@p1[19]@p2<TIE>To receive the arrows and the projectiles of the Egyptians.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo @ITRe”m@it explains that the angel of Elokim moved [behind them] as soon as the Egyptians came upon them. This was to separate the Egyptian camp from the camp of B’nei Yisrael and to absorb the arrows and projectiles. But the pillar of cloud moving behind them and the moving of the angel were separate matters. The pillar of cloud was to make it dark for the Egyptians. Question: Why does Rashi later say in 19:4 that the@IT cloud@it absorbed the arrows, etc? The answer is: As soon as the Egyptians came, the angel went behind them to separate and to absorb the arrows etc. But the cloud was still in front of them until it completed its tour over the camp and gave way to the pillar of fire. Then the pillar of cloud moved behind them to make it dark for the Egyptians, and the angel departed. But the Mechilta states that the cloud @ITand@it the angel absorbed the arrows, etc. The commentators resolve this matter; see @ITKitzur Mizrachi@it.<QC>
@p1[20]@p2<TIE>The pillar of fire.@bo [The verse has an unstated word and] it is as if it said, “The @ITlight source@it lit up the night” — referring to the pillar of fire, not to the angel. @p1@p2One camp to another.@bo This explanation disagrees with the Midrashic explanation that @hh<HEB>ולא קרב זה אל זה@ee<ENG> refers to the angels, who did not recite shirah. (Maharshal)<QC>
@p1[21]@p2<TIE>All the waters of the world.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because it already said, “He made the sea into dry land.” Alternatively, because it should have said, “The @ITsea@it was divided.” @p1[23]@p2<TIE>Was there only one horse.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi is asking:] @hh<HEB>כל@ee<ENG> indicates something that is two or more. Why then is @hh<HEB>סוס@ee<ENG> written in the singular form? Rashi did not ask this on @hh<HEB>כל סוס רכב פרעה@ee<ENG> (v. 9), because there, @hh<HEB>כל@ee<ENG> refers collectively to horse and chariot. But here the question arises, since it is written @hh<HEB>סוס@ee<ENG>, in the singular form. This resolves @ITRe”m@it’s difficulty; see there.<QC>
@p1[24]@p2<TIE>It is for this reason that Onkelos translates it: @HB<HEB>מטרת@BO<ENG>.@p3 This word means waiting. @p1@p2He gazed.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows it was to destroy them] because every expression of @hh<HEB>השקפה@ee<ENG> in Scripture is for something bad, except for: “Gaze down (@hh<HEB>השקיפה@ee<ENG>) from Your Holy dwelling place” (Devarim 26:15). [There it is for the good] because giving gifts to the poor has such great power, [that it even changes Hashem’s anger to compassion]. @p1@p2The pillar of fire heated it up.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo [Rashi says this] because in between the divided water standing on both sides was dry land, for B’nei Yisrael crossed the sea on dry land. Therefore, after B’nei Yisrael passed, the pillar of cloud moistened the land within the sea to make it like soft clay. Then the pillar of fire came and heated it up. @p1@p2He took away their senses.@bo @hh<HEB>סגניות @ee<ENG> means intelligence, as in: “One thought (@hh<HEB>סגנון@ee<ENG>) is presented to many prophets.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (Sanhedrin 89a)<QC>
@p1[26]@p2<TIE>The waters that were standing erect.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi explains this because @hh<HEB>וישובו@ee<ENG> seems to imply that the waters will come back @ITagain@it over the chariots and cavalry, while in truth the waters were still standing erect until Moshe extended his hand over the sea.<QC>
@p1[30]@p2<TIE>The sea expelled them onto its shore.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Otherwise, how could Yisrael see them? They drowned in the sea! @p1[1]@p2<TIE>@BIThen@BO, when Moshe saw.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Why did it not say @hh<HEB>אז שר@ee<ENG> (present tense)? @hh<HEB>ישיר@ee<ENG> is future tense, while @hh<HEB>אז@ee<ENG> is present tense, conveying: “then he sings.” Rashi answers: “Then, when Moshe saw the miracle, it entered his mind.<TIE>.<TIE>.” In other words, @hh<HEB>ישיר@ee<ENG> refers to his [present] thought to sing. @p1@p2And he did so: “And they said.<TIE>.<TIE>.”@p3 I.e., for right afterward it is written, “I will sing.” @p1@p2From here we derive an allusion that the resurrection of the dead.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Meaning:@hh<HEB>ישיר @ee<ENG> implies at a future time.<QC>
@p1[2]@p2<TIE>Being the same as @HB<HEB>rֻזִי@BO<ENG>, vocalized with a @BIshuruk@BO, and @HB<HEB>וזמרת@BO<ENG> being the same as @HB<HEB>וזמרתי@BO<ENG>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Meaning: “My might and My praise.” @p1@p2And the second one is not a @BIsheva @BOor @BIchatef@BO.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is referring to the middle letter of @hh<HEB>עזי@ee<ENG>, which is @hh<HEB>ז@ee<ENG>, and to the middle letter of @hh<HEB>חקי@ee<ENG>, [which is @hh<HEB>ק@ee<ENG>], etc. @p1@p2And they are all followed by @HB<HEB>ויהי לי לישועה@BO<ENG>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo [Rashi is saying:] If @hh<HEB>וזמרת@ee<ENG> means @hh<HEB>וזמרתי@ee<ENG> (my praise), why then does it say @hh<HEB>ויהי לי לישועה@ee<ENG>? Could it be that his praise was the cause of his deliverance? (@ITMaharshal@it)<QC>
@p1@p2Do not wonder about the use of @HB<HEB>ויהי@BO<ENG>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo Whereas according to Onkelos, [the use of @hh<HEB>ויהי@ee<ENG>] is quite appropriate, as the verse is saying: “Hashem is my might and my praise.” And @hh<HEB>ויהי לי לישועה @ee<ENG> is a new point: [“He was my deliverance.”] @p1@p2Is this, and I will exalt Him.@bo Rashi adds the word “this” because @hh<HEB>אלהי אבי@ee<ENG> stands separately, and seems to imply that “Hashem of my father” is a different God [from the God previously mentioned]. Thus Rashi explains the verse as if it said, “This is my God and the God of my father, and I will glorify and exalt Him.” @p1[4]@p2<TIE>A noun as @HB<HEB>מרכב@BO<ENG>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo I.e., we should not say that the @hh<HEB>מ@ee<ENG> is a prefix, and the word means @hh<HEB>מן מבחר@ee<ENG> (some of the elite).<QC>
@p1[6]@p2<TIE>It is constantly crushing.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo I.e., we should not understand that @hh<HEB>תרעץ@ee<ENG> is in the future tense. Rashi similarly explains @hh<HEB>תהרוס@ee<ENG> (v. 7). @p1[8]@p2<TIE>For the sake of My Name I will lengthen My breath”.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., I will not be angry. For “when one’s anger is calmed, his breath is longer.” @p1@p2I will place a nose-ring in My nose.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo @hh<HEB>חטם@ee<ENG> means “nose-ring,” as Rashi continues to explain: “In order to close up My nostrils against.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1@p2@hb<HEB>אחטם@BO<ENG> is like @HB<HEB>נאקה בחטם@BO<ENG>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo The @ITAruch@it explains: They pierce the animal’s nostrils and insert a ring there. They put a leash through the ring by which they lead the animal. Rashi’s explanation ad loc seems the same.<QC>
@p1@p2@hb<HEB>חרון@BO<ENG> is derived from @HB<HEB>חרה@BO<ENG>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [First] Rashi proves from Scripture that @hh<HEB>חרה@ee<ENG> means “burning”. [Then] Rashi says: if so, @hh<HEB>חרון@ee<ENG> also is an expression of “burning,” because @hh<HEB>חרון@ee<ENG> is derived from @hh<HEB>חרה@ee<ENG>.<QC>
@p1[9]@p2<TIE>My spirit and my will.@p3 [Rashi explains that the expression of] @hh<HEB>מלא@ee<ENG> (to fill) can be used relating to one’s “will,” as in: “To fill (@hh<HEB>למלאות@ee<ENG>) the will of your Father in Heaven.” Also: “To fulfill (@hh<HEB>למלאות@ee<ENG>) his friend’s will.” @p1@p2Do not wonder about a word that expresses something expressed by two words.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., it is one word that is like two words.<QC>
@p1@p2The same meaning as: “And he armed his trained servants”.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 See Bereishis 14:14. @p1[11]@p2<TIE>As is written: “For You, silence is praise.”@p3 Therefore, when a person prays, [as in the first blessing of the Amidah,] he should conclude [his praises of Hashem] with the word @hh<HEB>הנורא@ee<ENG>. For it is written (Devarim 10:17): “God of all gods, Master of all masters, Hashem, the Great, the Mighty, the Awesome (@hh<HEB>הנורא@ee<ENG>).” And so with all [other praises of Hashem. One should not add more than was fixed by Scripture and @ITChazal@it.]<QC>
@p1[14]@p2<TIE>They tremble.@p3 Rashi is saying that @hh<HEB>ירגזון@ee<ENG> is the present tense, not future. @p1@p2Who had calculated prematurely the end.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 They calculated that the period began at the time of the decree of@hh<HEB>בין הבתרים@ee<ENG>, which was 30 years before Yitzchok was born [and thus they attempted to leave Egypt 30 years before the prescribed time]. @p1[15]@p2<TIE>For they were not going against them.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo [Rashi knows this] because it says (Devarim 2:9), “Do not afflict Moav,” and (ibid 2:5), “Do not attack them (Edom).” Although these verses were written 40 years after their Exodus, they were actually commanded many years earlier. (@ITMechilta@it) See also Tosafos @hh<HEB>נשא משה ד"ה@ee<ENG>, Bava Kama 38a. @p1@p2Pained over the honor of Yisrael.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo And they feared Yisrael would quarrel with them on account of the quarrels [that were] between the shepherds of Avraham and Lot, and between Yaakov and Eisov.

Perforce [it means, “You hold it dearer.<TIE>.<TIE>..”] @p1[17]@p2<TIE>The Temple below is lined up.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo [Rashi knows this] because instead of @hh<HEB>מקום@ee<ENG> it is written @hh<HEB>מָכוֹן@ee<ENG> [which may also be read @hh<HEB>מְכֻוָּן@ee<ENG>, “lined up”]. (@ITGur Aryeh@it) The verse reads as follows: “You will bring them and plant them on the mountain of Your inheritance.” And that mountain is lined up with “the place for Your habitation” above, “which You have made.” (“You have made” refers to “Your habitation,” which is the Throne above.) However, not the whole mountain is @hh<HEB>מכון@ee<ENG> — only “the Sanctuary which Your hands established” is @hh<HEB>מכון@ee<ENG>, i.e., @hh<HEB>מְכֻוָן@ee<ENG>. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it; see there.) @p1[18]@p2<TIE>Therefore it is vocalized with a @BIpatach@BO.@p3 The @IT“patach”@it means the @ITsegol@it (called “@ITpatach koton@it”) which is under the @hh<HEB>ע@ee<ENG> of @hh<HEB>ועד@ee<ENG>. @p1@p2Where the letter @HB<HEB>ו@BO<ENG> in it is a prefix, it bears the @BIkametz@BO vowel.@p3 The @IT“kametz”@it means the @ITtzeirei@it, which is called “@ITkametz koton.@it” “It bears” refers to the @ITword@it @hh<HEB>ועד@ee<ENG> [not to the letter @ITvav@it].<QC>
@p1[19]@p2<TIE>@BIWhen@BO it came.@p3 The verses mean as follows: Because Pharaoh’s horse came into the sea, therefore Miriam took the drum. And this is what Rashi means: When it came, Miriam then took. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it)<QC>
@p1[21]@p2<TIE>Miriam sang the song for the women.@bo Although regarding Miriam only the first stanza is written, [she sang the whole song]. Scripture abbreviated, relying on the fact that the song is written above. @p1[22]@p2<TIE>He made them travel against their will.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because otherwise, why does it say, “Moshe led”? They always traveled by command of Hashem. @p1@p2The Egyptians adorned their horses with gold and silver ornaments and precious stones.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 You might ask: Is it not written (12:36), “They drained Egypt of its wealth,” and Rashi explains [in Bereishis 45:18] that they made Egypt like the depths of the sea which has no fish, [i.e., they emptied Egypt from its wealth]? The answer is: Here it is speaking of their hidden treasures. @p1@p2We will make gold bracelets for you, together with silver studs.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., “gold bracelets” are the booty of the sea, and “silver studs” are from the booty of Egypt — as stated in Midrash. @p1[24]@p2<TIE>To revert the statement to the person: @HB<HEB>מתלונן@BO<ENG>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo I.e., meaning: [It refers] to the complainer. But the expression @hh<HEB>לונן@ee<ENG> does not revert to the complainer as much.<QC>
@p1[25]@p2<TIE>That they occupy themselves with them: Shabbos, @BIParah Adumah@BO.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo You might ask: How does Rashi know it was these three sections? The answer is: the Torah speaks of Shabbos right afterward (16:23). [I.e., Shabbos is the first mitzvah to be mentioned afterward.] An alternative answer: In the second set of the Ten Commandments it is written [about Shabbos], “As He commanded you” (Devarim 5:12), and Rashi explains: “As He commanded you.<TIE>.<TIE>. in@IT Marah@it.” Regarding the @ITParah Adumah,@it [the answer is]: Here it is written @hh<HEB>חק@ee<ENG>, and regarding @ITParah Adumah @itit is also written @hh<HEB>חקת@ee<ENG> (Bamidbar 19:2). The commentators discuss this at length, as the Mechilta and the Gemara [additionally] mention other mitzvos; see there. @BOThey did not consult with Moshe with respectful language.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo @ITRe”m@it writes: I do not know what forced Rashi to explain that “There He tested them” refers to their complaint. And consequently, it is unrelated to the statutes and ordinances that He set before them. Why did Rashi not explain that it refers to the mitzvos He gave them, to test them if they will accept the mitzvos with joy? And that would fit better with what follows: “If you vigilantly obey.<TIE>.<TIE>.” The answer [to @ITRe”m’s@it objection] is: If “There he tested them” referred to the mitzvos He gave them, it should have simply said: “There He set before them statutes and ordinances, and He tested them.” Why does it say, “And@IT there@it He tested them”? The word “there” implies it is a new point. Thus Rashi explains that it refers to the people’s complaint. @p1[26]@p2<TIE>And if I do bring it, it will be as if it were not brought — for “I am Hashem, Who heals you.”@bo Rashi is answering the question: If He will not bring sickness, what is the meaning of, “I am Hashem, Who @ITheals@it you”? Thus Rashi explains, “And if I do bring it.<TIE>.<TIE>.” means as follows: “If you vigilantly obey,” then I will not bring sickness. But if you do not obey, then I will bring it upon you. However, “It will be as if it were not brought.<TIE>.<TIE>.”<QC>
@p1@p2It will be healthful to your body.@bo I.e., from here we learn that it is healthful and prevents sickness. @p1[27]@p2<TIE>Corresponding to the twelve Tribes.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Why does it mention the number? @p1@p2Were made available to them.@p3 I.e., B’nei Yisrael found them. It does not mean they were created now, for it is written (Koheles 1:9), “There is nothing new under the sun.”<QC>
@p1[1]@p2<TIE>Sixty one meals.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 There were sixteen days of Nisan and fifteen days of Iyar until the manna first descended. This makes sixty-two meals. However, they ate their first meal in Egypt on the night of the fifteenth, and went out that morning. @p1@p2Which was on the first day of the week.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because it is written, “Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day” from when it began to descend “is Shabbos, there will be none on that day” (16:26). @ITRe”m@it asks: Our verse shows that the fifteenth of Iyar, when they traveled from Eilim to the desert of Sin, was Shabbos. [For the manna started to fall the next morning, on Sunday]. But were they not commanded already at Marah to keep Shabbos [and certain other mitzvos? If so, how could they carry their possessions, and go beyond the Shabbos boundary? @ITRe”m@it] answers: Perhaps the fifteenth of the month mentioned in our verse is when they @ITarrived@it, but they actually journeyed on Friday the fourteenth. (See the @ITNachalas Yaakov @itregarding this.)<QC>
@p1[3]@p2<TIE>Onkelos translates it @HB<HEB>לוי דמיתנא@BO<ENG>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Meaning: Onkelos translates @hh<HEB>מי יתן מותנו@ee<ENG> just as he translates the verse @hh<HEB>לו מתנו@ee<ENG> (Bamidbar 14:2). And @hh<HEB>לו מתנו@ee<ENG> clearly means, “If only that we should die.” Thus our verse also means, “If only that we should die.” @p1[4]@p2<TIE>The food requirements for the day.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 @hh<HEB>דבר@ee<ENG> means “matter” or “requirements.” Since the day’s requirement comprises many things, Rashi explains that here it pertains to the day’s food requirements. And Rashi inserts @hh<HEB>"ילקטו"@ee<ENG> in between @hh<HEB>יום@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>ביומו@ee<ENG>. This is to tell us that @hh<HEB>ביומו@ee<ENG> refers back to @hh<HEB>ולקטו@ee<ENG>, rather than to @hh<HEB>יום@ee<ENG> which immediately precedes it. [Thus it means: “They shall gather on that day the food requirements for the day”]. Otherwise it would mean, “They shall gather the requirements of the day of that day.” This is not understandable. Furthermore, it does not tell us the time of the manna’s gathering. Rashi also [adds, “They may not gather today for tomorrow’s needs.”] This tells us that @hh<HEB>ולקטו@ee<ENG> does not mean there is an obligation to gather manna. Rather, there is a prohibition to gather today for tomorrow’s needs. @p1@p2Whether they will keep.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 @ITRe”m@it writes that the correct text of Rashi includes the words @hh<HEB>בו אנסנו@ee<ENG> — “That I may test them through @ITit”@it — referring back to, “I will make bread rain from heaven.” In other words, I will test them through the mitzvos dealing with the manna, which are: 1. keeping Shabbos 2. not gathering [manna] today for tomorrow’s needs. Accordingly, @hh<HEB>בו אנסנו@ee<ENG> does not refer to the immediately preceding phrase, “Gather enough for each day.” For then it would mean that [only] the mitzvah of not gathering today for tomorrow’s needs was used to test them if they will keep mitzvos. This is not logical, for why would Hashem wish to test them in the mitzvah of not leaving manna overnight, but not in the mitzvah of keeping Shabbos? @p1@p2Mitzvos dealing with it.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi is saying that the test here] is not like what he explained on, “To test you to know if you will keep His mitzvos” (Devarim 8:2). Rashi there explains that it means: “That you not test Him and question His ways.” [Rashi knows this because] there, the test is connected to previously mentioned affliction. And a test by an affliction is to determine that you do not question His ways. But since no pain or affliction is mentioned here, the test cannot be to determine that you do not question His ways. [@ITRe”m@it] For if a person is told, “I am testing you to see if you will question My ways,” it is not a test! [Once the person knows why Hashem is doing it, there is no point in questioning His ways.] But it is logical to say, “I will test you to see if you will keep My mitzvos,” [because one’s dedication to mitzvos is being tested]. However in Devarim, it is Moshe who is saying [about past events], “He afflicted you.<TIE>.<TIE>. to test you” if you will question His ways. (@ITGur Aryeh@it) @p1[5]@p2<TIE>As they usually gathered.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Why is it “twice as much”? Perhaps this amount normally comes down [on Friday]. Rashi answers: It is “twice as much” when compared to what they usually gathered each day. In other words, it was not twice as much as they gathered the whole week — which would be ten @ITomers —@it as the verse seems to imply.<QC>
@p1[6]@p2<TIE>The same as “in the evening.”@bo [Instead of @hb<HEB>ל@hhערב@ee<ENG>,] the correct text of Rashi reads @hb<HEB>ב@hhערב@ee<ENG> — as it says afterward (v. 8): @hh<HEB>ויאמר משה בתת ה' לכם @hbב@hhערב@ee<ENG>. @p1[7]@p2<TIE>Not a reference to the glory that is mentioned: “and behold.<TIE>.<TIE>.”@bo [Rashi knows this] because it is not written, “And behold the glory of Hashem was visible in the cloud @ITin the morning.@it” [Rather, the glory was visible in the cloud that same day.] For you asked for something improperly.<TIE>.<TIE>. I.e., you asked it unnecessarily because a person can survive without meat. Furthermore, you made your request “on a full stomach,” i.e., they had much livestock.<QC>
@p1@p2Is the same as: @BIthat@BO are against Hashem.@p3 [Rashi is answering the question:] The apparent meaning of @hh<HEB>בשמעו את תלונותיכם על ה'@ee<ENG> is: now He will hear that your complaints are against Him. But Hashem knows this! [Thus Rashi explains:] It rather comes to tell us against whom these complaints really were. [Although they ostensibly were “against Moshe and Aharon” (v. 2), in truth] they were against Hashem. [For “what are we that you cause complaints against us?”]. @p1[14]@p2<TIE>The dew rose from the earth into the air.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo Meaning: The world’s natural order is that bread comes up from the earth, and water descends from the heavens. But here it was the opposite. The manna — bread — descended from heaven, and the dew came up from the earth, as it says in Midrash Tanchuma. @p1@p2And when the layer of dew rose up, the manna appeared and they saw.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo Rashi explained before: “When the sun shone then the dew which was on the manna rose.” Accordingly, he now explains that the verse is saying that when the dew rose, the manna was revealed and they @ITsaw@it it — not that it came into existence when the dew rose. However, according to the Sages’ explanation that the dew came up from the earth, “Behold on the surface of the desert” means that the manna actually came into existence, i.e., when the dew rose from the earth, the manna descended onto the surface of the desert.<QC>
@p1@p2Comes from the phrase “a box and a chest.”@p3 @hh<HEB>חפיסה ודלוסקמא@ee<ENG> are various jugs and flasks. @p1@p2It was as fine as @HB<HEB>גיר@BO<ENG> and lay.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., the manna did not look like @hh<HEB>גיר@ee<ENG>, for @hh<HEB>גיר@ee<ENG> is black while the manna was white. Rather, it means the manna was as fine as @hh<HEB>גיר@ee<ENG>.<QC>
@p1[17]@p2<TIE>Some gathered much, some gathered little.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 It does not mean that some transgressed Moshe’s command and gathered more or less than an @ITomer@it per person. For if so, why would it say, “The B’nei Yisrael did so”? @p1[20]@p2<TIE>Dosson and Aviram.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because it is written @hh<HEB>אנשים@ee<ENG>. Anywhere that it says “@hh<HEB>אנשים@ee<ENG>” [in a negative context], or @hh<HEB>נצים@ee<ENG>, it refers to Dosson and Aviram. @p1@p2Derived from @HB<HEB>רמה@BO<ENG>.@p3 [@hh<HEB>רמה@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>תולעים@ee<ENG> are synonyms, so] it is like saying @hh<HEB>והתליעו תולעים@ee<ENG>. @hh<HEB>וירם@ee<ENG> is not derived from @hh<HEB>הורמה@ee<ENG>, in which case it would mean: “the manna brought up worms,” for we never find @hh<HEB>וירם@ee<ENG> as a transitive verb. @p1@p2This verse is inverted.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 It seems to me that it is not inverted. The manna was a heavenly food (see Tehillim 78:25), and it was not natural for it to become putrid. So first it became wormy, and because of the worms it became putrid. (@ITMaharshal@it) But what he says seems incorrect, for it is written, “.<TIE>.<TIE>.As Moshe had commanded. It did not become putrid, and it had no worms” (v. 24). [This shows that the order was first putrid and then wormy, as Rashi said.] @p1[21]@p2<TIE>That which remained in the field.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., it was not the manna they gathered that melted. For if so, what would they eat?<QC>
@p1@p2@HB<HEB>פשר@BO<ENG> is from @HB<HEB>פושרים@BO<ENG> — lukewarm water.@bo Onkelos translates @hh<HEB>נמס@ee<ENG> as @hh<HEB>פושרין@ee<ENG> because the sun turns it into lukewarm water. @p1[22]@p2<TIE>They measured what they gathered.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi is saying:] It does not mean that because they knew the manna would not descend tomorrow they intentionally gathered double, for today and tomorrow. Because if so, why did the leaders come to tell Moshe when they saw they had a double portion, to which Moshe replied, “This is what Hashem had said.<TIE>.<TIE>.”?<QC>
@p1[23]@p2<TIE>What you wish to bake.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: What is the difference between @hh<HEB>תאפו@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>בשלו@ee<ENG>? It seems redundant. [Rashi is also answering the question:]@hh<HEB> את אשר@ee<ENG> implies an action that had already been taken; otherwise it should say @hb<HEB>אם@hh תאפו אפו@ee<ENG>. So if they had already baked and cooked, why should they bake and cook it again? Therefore Rashi explains that @hh<HEB>את אשר תאפו@ee<ENG> means, “What you @ITwish to@it bake.” @p1@p2For storage.@p3 As in, “It shall be stored away (@hh<HEB>למשמרת@ee<ENG>) for the B’nei Yisrael” (Bamidbar 19:9). But not as in, “Keep the watch (@hh<HEB>משמרת@ee<ENG>) of the Mishkon and the watch of the altar” (ibid. 18:5). @p1[25]@p2<TIE>In the morning, when they were accustomed.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: How does [“For today is Shabbos”] give a reason for the preceding statement, [“Eat it today”]? If they asked, “Shall we eat it or not?” then Moshe needed only to answer, “Eat it today.” Whereas if they asked, “Shall we go out or not?” then Moshe’s answer is understandable. Moshe was saying, “Eat what you have, for today is Shabbos and you will not find it [if you go out].” Possibly, they were misled by Moshe’s instructions (v. 23): “Whatever is left over, put aside for yourselves,” and Rashi explains this as, “For storage.” So they thought it meant for long term storage — as in, “It shall be stored away for you for all your generations” — rather than meaning they should [set it aside to] eat the next day. That is why they inquired about going out and not about eating. @p1@p2In the evening they again came before him and asked him.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo This was because they reasoned: perhaps it is only for the Shabbos meal that we should not go out to gather, but for the [post-Shabbos] night meal, we should go out. This is because Friday prepares for Shabbos, but not for the weekday. Therefore, they asked Moshe again. @p1[26]@p2<TIE>This verse comes only to add.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Otherwise [it is superfluous, for] it is already written (v. 25), “For today is Shabbos to Hashem. Today you will not find it.” Perforce, [this verse comes only to add.<TIE>.<TIE>.].<QC>
@p1[28]@p2<TIE>There is a proverb among common people.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo The proverb is that when thorns, weeds and vegetables grow together in a field, a bit of the good cabbage sometimes gets pulled out along with the thorns — “The cabbage is stricken with the weeds.” So too here: along with B’nei Yisrael who sinned, those who did not sin [i.e., Moshe] were also stricken. You might ask: Did Rashi not himself explain on v. 22 that the sin was attributed to Moshe because he did not tell them about the laws of [Shabbos pertaining to] the manna, until they asked? The answer is: Both factors contributed. [The proof is as follows:] if the only reason was for failing to tell them the mitzvah of Shabbos, why did Hashem not reprove him right away, rather than waiting until now? Perforce, because “the cabbage is stricken with the weeds.” And if the only reason was because “the cabbage is stricken with the weeds,” why then was Moshe singled out here and included with the wicked, rather than the other times B’nei Yisrael sinned? We therefore must conclude that both factors contributed. @p1[29]@p2<TIE>With your own eyes that.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo Meaning: See with your own eyes that Hashem gives you double bread on Shabbos eve. @ITRe”m@it asked: How does this prove Shabbos’s sanctity? Perhaps Friday is more blessed, and that is why Hashem gave it double bread. For any blessing is manifested by an increase of goodness. And if the proof is that the manna did not descend on Shabbos, the verse should have said: “Therefore the manna did @ITnot@it descend on the Shabbos.” @ITRe”m@it gives his answer, but it seems to me [that the answer is]: They gathered it on Friday, some much more, some much less, but when they measured it at home they all found that they had only double bread, two @ITomers@it per person. But, if the reason for the extra manna is attributed that Friday is [more] blessed, why did they have just double bread and no more? Let Friday’s blessing enrich them! Perforce, double bread descended on Friday in order for them to eat it on Friday @ITand Shabbos@it. Therefore Rashi writes that a miracle occurs every Shabbos eve when He gives you bread for @ITtwo days.@it Rashi is emphasizing that it was just enough for two days and not any more. @p1@p2From here the Sages found an allusion.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because it is written, “Every man must remain in his place,” implying it is forbidden to move around [on Shabbos]. But this is not so, for it is written, “They found a man chopping wood” (Bamidbar 15:32). It is evident that those who found him were moving around, and this implies it is permitted to move around. Thus Rashi explains that our verse alludes [specifically to “someone who had gone out of the Shabbos limit.” This individual is restricted to his place and he may not move beyond his four @ITamos@it]. @p1@p2Three for his body.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo [Rashi knows this] because it is written @hh<HEB>שבו איש תחתיו@ee<ENG>, implying he must remain in the area that is @hh<HEB>תחתיו@ee<ENG> (under him). And how much area is under him? Four @ITamos@it. Three for his body, and one @ITamoh@it to stretch his arms and legs.<QC>
@p1[33]@p2<TIE>In front of the Ark.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because wherever it is, it is before Hashem since the whole world is His. [Thus, the verse must be referring to Hashem’s special place.] @p1[35]@p2<TIE>For on the fifteenth day of Iyar.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo You might ask: Did not Rashi explain before in v. 1 that the manna first descended on the sixteenth? The answer is: There Rashi meant the beginning of the sixteenth. And here he means at the end of the fifteenth, for he is counting the night after the previous day, because the manna descended right away on the sixteenth before morning.<QC>
@p1[36]@p2<TIE>Consequently 1/10.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because an @ITeiphoh@it is 432 eggs in total. A tenth of 400 is 40, and a tenth of 30 is 3. 2 eggs remain. If you divide each remaining eggs into 5 parts, then 2 eggs make 10 parts. A tenth of this is 1/5 of an egg. (@ITMaharshal@it)<QC>
@p1[4]@p2<TIE>If I wait etc.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi adds, “@ITIf@it I wait,” because otherwise it implies they will surely stone him before long — whether or not he waits [to give them water].<QC>
@p1[8]@p2<TIE>Places this section adjacent.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo It is surprising that Rashi brings this Midrash, as he only brings Midrashim explaining adjacent sections when the sections are written out of sequence. But here they need to be adjacent because both incidents occurred in the same place. (@ITRe”m@it) @ITGur Aryeh@it explains that Rashi [brings the Midrash because he] is answering the question: Why did it not say, “Amalek @ITwent out,”@it as in (Devarim 2:32), “Sichon @ITwent out@it to war against us”? Therefore Rashi explains: “The Torah places this section adjacent to the previous verse.<TIE>.<TIE>. that the dog (Amaleik) will @ITcome@it and bite you.<TIE>.<TIE>..” [In other words, it says] “Amaleik @ITcame@it” because they asked, “Is Hashem among us or not?” [Another explanation:] I wrote many times that Rashi only explains why verses are adjacent when there are extra words. Therefore Rashi comments here about the juxtaposition. Rashi is answering the question: Is “In Rephidim” not superfluous? It is written in v. 17:1, “They camped in Rephidim.” And it is written in 19:2, “They journeyed from Rephidim.” Consequently, whatever happened in between occurred in Rephidim. Perforce, “In Rephidim” is written here to tell us that the incident occurred in Rephidim [i.e., the verse of, “They tested Hashem, saying, ‘Is Hashem among us or not?’”] caused that “Amaleik came.” And that is why Rashi says, “Adjacent to the previous @ITverse@it,” rather than, “Adjacent to the previous @ITsection@it.” Rashi is explaining the juxtaposition [of “Amaleik came”] specifically regarding this verse. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it)<QC>
@p1[9]@p2<TIE>At the time of battle, I will stand.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because otherwise, why does it say specifically, “@ITTomorrow@it [I will stand”]? Perforce, because that is the time of battle. Rashi goes on to say, “I will stand,” to convey that “tomorrow” is connected to “I will stand.” Accordingly, the verse means: Tomorrow, at the time of battle, I will stand and pray for you. This was to encourage Yehoshua and strengthen him for battle, for he will be confident of victory due to Moshe’s prayers during the battle. But if “tomorrow” refers to the preceding, [and the verse reads: “Tomorrow go out to battle Amaleik,”] then what does [“I will stand”] come to teach us?<QC>
@p1[12]@p2<TIE>Moshe was.<TIE>.<TIE>. hands were with faithfulness.@bo Rashi is answering the question: [If @hh<HEB>ויהי@ee<ENG> refers to Moshe’s @IThands@it] why did it not say @hh<HEB>ויהיו@ee<ENG>, [the plural form, rather than @hh<HEB>ויהי@ee<ENG>]? Thus Rashi explains that @hh<HEB>ויהי@ee<ENG> refers to Moshe, not to his hands. @p1@p2Faithful and well-intended prayer.@bo [@hh<HEB>תפלה@ee<ENG> @hh<HEB>נכונה@ee<ENG>] means: focused prayer. [@ITMaharshal@it] @p1[13]@p2<TIE>And left only.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Why is it written, “Yehoshua @ITweakened@it.<TIE>.<TIE>. with the edge of the sword”? If Yehoshua killed with the sword, then they were not weakened but killed. Therefore Rashi explains, “And left only the weak.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1@p2From this we may conclude.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo Meaning: Hashem’s command was not mentioned at the beginning of this war. Rather, it is written “@ITMoshe@it said to Yehoshua” (v. 9), as if Moshe commanded him on his own. Thus Rashi explains that Moshe acted according to Hashem’s command. And the proof is from our verse, for if it was not according to Hashem’s specific command, then Yehoshua [who was able to kill the mighty ones] would not have left the weak ones alive, but he would have killed them all. @p1[16]@p2<TIE>The hand of Hashem.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is resolving several issues. First, he says, “The hand of Hashem,” because the unidentified hand mentioned in the verse seems to mean Moshe’s hand. Second, he says, “Is raised,” to convey that Hashem’s hand is not always on His Throne [as the verse seems to mean]. Rather, His hand is momentarily raised toward it, similar to: “For I shall raise My hand to Heaven.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (Devarim 32:40). (See @ITKitzur Mizrachi.@it)<QC>
@p1[1]@p2<TIE>What news had he heard.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 that motivated him to come? (@ITRe”m@it) Question: Perhaps his coming was motivated equally by all the news, not by one incident more than another? The answer is: [One Tanna says that Yisro heard of the splitting of the Sea and thus came, and another says it was the war with Amaleik (Zevachim 116a).] According to the Tannaim, @hh<HEB>וישמע יתרו@ee<ENG> means Yisro heard [especially significant] news other than what the Torah mentions afterward, for otherwise the Torah should have stated @hh<HEB>ויתרו שמע@ee<ENG>. Accordingly, the phrase following @hh<HEB>את כל אשר עשה@ee<ENG> means: “@ITAnd@it he heard about all.<TIE>.<TIE>.” This is similar to @hh<HEB>כי הוציא@ee<ENG>, which [perforce] means: “@ITAnd@it that Hashem brought.” @ITRe”m@it asks: Why did Rashi omit the [third] opinion (in Zevachim 116a) that Yisro heard of the giving of the Torah, and thus came? @ITRe”m@it offers an answer, but it seems he overlooked the dispute in @ITZevachim@it 116a as to whether Yisro came before the Torah was given, or afterward. Since Rashi stated in many places that Yisro came after the Torah was given, [Rashi gave this opinion sufficient mention. Thus] he does not need to mention it here. (See @ITNachalas Yaakov.@it) [Alternatively, Rashi says it was the splitting of the Sea and the war of Amaleik] because he is answering the question: Why is it not written either: “Yisro saw,” as in “Balak saw” (Bamidbar 22:2), or: “Yisro knew”? Rashi answers: Because Yisro @ITheard@it about the splitting of the Sea and the war of Amaleik. They were one-time events, about which it cannot be said that “he saw” or “he knew.” For when Yisro came, he did not see that the Sea had split or that there had been a war with Amaleik. Now it is understandable why Rashi did not say Yisro “heard” about the manna, the well or the Torah. For [if it was referring to them] the Torah would have written, “Yisro saw,” since the manna, the well and the Torah were there for many years, and it could properly be said that he saw them. But this is not the case with the splitting of the Sea and the war of Amaleik. (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1@p2He was called by seven names.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 However, in Bamidbar 10:29, Rashi mentions only two names, as it stated in the Sifrei. [It is Rashi’s way to cite differing Midrashim.] @p1@p2A letter was added to his name.@p3 @ITRe”m@it asks: If so, there are only six names! Before he converted he was called Yeser and not Yisro. After he converted he was called Yisro and not Yeser. They should not be considered as two names, just as Avram and Avraham should not be considered as two names. @ITRe”m@it leaves this question unanswered. But it seems to me not to be a question, for Rashi does not say, “He @IThas@it seven names.” He rather says, “He @ITwas called@it by seven names.” I.e., some names he was called before he converted, and some, afterward. (@ITMaharshal@it) Yet, it seems to me there is no proof that his name was [always] Yeser until he converted. Perhaps he [originally] had a different name. For Rashi also explained the verse, “Moshe went and returned to Yeser his father-in-law” (4:18), that Yisro was called seven names, just like Rashi explains here — but that was before Yisro converted and before he caused an additional @ITparsha@it in the Torah. Perforce, he had a different name before he converted, and there the Torah called him “Yeser” based on a future event. In truth, when he came and advised Moshe how to judge the people, he was immediately called [the new name of] Yeser, because he caused this additional @ITparsha@it in the Torah. And this occurred before he converted. After he converted, the letter @hh<HEB>ו@ee<ENG> was then added [to his name]. Thus, he was called seven names in addition to his original, nonJewish name. We need not object: In Parshas Shemos it said, “Moshe went and returned to @ITYeser@it, his father-in-law,” implying that his nonJewish name was Yeser. For this is no proof, as it is also written there, “Moshe tended the sheep of his father-in-law @ITYisro”@it (3:1),” [though Yisro had not yet converted]. Perforce, [he was called Yeser and Yisro] based on a future event, as I explained. (@ITAuthor’s commentary@it) @p1@p2Chovov is Yisro.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi says this] so we will not think Chovov was Yisro’s son. And Rashi clearly explains so on v. 13, [that we should not think this]. @p1@p2Others say that Re’uel was Yisro’s father.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Question: If so, Yisro would have only six names! The answer is: [Here,] Rashi is explaining according to the Mechilta [read: Sifrei] which says that he only had two names, Chovov and Yisro. Assumedly, the Mechilta [read: Sifrei] holds that he was called also Yeser, for it is written: “Moshe went and returned to @ITYeser@it his father-in-law.” This is because the Mechilta [read: Sifrei] holds that Yeser and Yisro are actually the same name, similar to Avram and Avraham. [Accordingly, Rashi is answering the] question: It is written, “They (Yisro’s daughters) came to their father Re’uel” (2:18). Does this not imply that Yisro was also called Re’uel, [giving him more than two names]? The other names do not pose a difficulty, for they could be family names, as the Torah does not say “their father” regarding them. But “Re’uel” poses a difficulty. Therefore [to resolve this difficulty] Rashi explains: “Others say that Re’uel was Yisro’s father.” (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1@p2Here Yisro prides himself with Moshe.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Taken on its own,] there is no difference between @hh<HEB>וישמע יתרו חותן משה@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>וישב משה אל יתר חותנו@ee<ENG>. In both cases, the Torah identifies Yisro by means of Moshe, not the other way around. This is because @hh<HEB>חותנו@ee<ENG> (“his father-in-law) means the same as @hh<HEB>חותן משה@ee<ENG> (“Moshe’s father-inlaw”). But the context makes a difference. [In the latter verse,] the subject of the story is Moshe, and Yisro is mentioned as “his father-inlaw.” Thus the story implied that Moshe is priding himself [with Yisro. In the former verse,] the story’s subject is Yisro, and Yisro is mentioned as “Moshe’s father-in-law.” Thus it is implied that Yisro is priding himself [with Moshe]. @p1@p2Moshe is equal to all of Yisrael.@bo [Rashi knows this] because otherwise it should say only “Yisrael,” for this would also include Moshe. Perforce, it comes to teach that Moshe is equal. Why does Rashi’s commentary not follow the order of the verse? [I.e., he first explains, “For Moshe and Yisrael,” and then, “About all that Elohim had done.”] It is because Rashi is answering the question: “All that Elohim had done” surely [seems to] refer to, “Hashem brought Yisrael out of Egypt.” But [if it is really] referring to this, why [does it say, “For @ITMoshe@it and Yisrael”? The phrase should place Yisrael before Moshe, because Yisrael was enslaved, but Moshe and his tribe were not, as Rashi explained in 5:4. But if Moshe is greater than all of Yisrael, it would be logical [to place Moshe first]. But being that Moshe was equal but not greater, Yisrael should have come first, since the main reason for the Exodus was for them [and the question remains unresolved]. Neither can we answer that Moshe is placed first in order to teach that he was @ITequal@it to all of Yisrael. For this is learned from the mere fact that Moshe is mentioned separately, as I explained at the beginning. Thus, Rashi answers as follows: “All that Elohim had done” does @ITnot@it refer to Hashem’s bringing them out of Egypt. It rather refers to the manna, [the well and the war of Amaleik, as Rashi states in the next entry]. These acts of goodness benefited both Moshe and Yisrael equally. And since Hashem performed these acts mainly for Moshe, he is mentioned first. Hashem brought the manna and the well in order to save Moshe from Yisrael’s complaints against him. And Moshe, who was the king of Yisrael, defeated Amaleik by his prayer and by confusing the hours for Amaleik as it says in the Midrash (see Rashi on 17:12). [This answers the original question: Why does Rashi’s commentary not follow the order of the verse? The answer is that Rashi first explained “For Moshe and Yisrael” because it is the key to understanding “About all that Elohim had done.” Since Moshe is placed before Yisrael, “All that Elohim had done” cannot refer to Hashem’s bringing them out of Egypt.] @p1@p2For them.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [You might ask:] Why does Rashi write, “For them,” instead of saying, “For Moshe and for His people Yisrael”? [The answer is: It is simply] for the sake of brevity. Similarly, Rashi says on 6:3, “To the fathers,” instead of saying, “To Avraham, to Yitzchok and to Yaakov.” (@ITRe”m@it) [An alternative answer:] So we will not think Hashem did some miracles for Moshe alone, and some for Yisrael alone. Therefore Rashi says, “For them,” to group them together. What he did for one, he did for the other. (@ITGur Aryeh@it) @p1@p2This being the greatest of them all.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Why was bringing them out of Egypt mentioned separately? Perforce, it is to tell us that it was “the greatest of them all.” For it says, “@ITAll@it that Elohim had done,” and concludes with, “That Hashem brought Yisrael out.” This implies that Hashem did other miracles as well, [besides bringing them out]. Otherwise, why does it says, “All”?<QC>
@p1[2]@p2<TIE>He said to her, “Go to your father’s house”.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo [Question: Why was Moshe concerned only about his wife, whereupon her sons she took on her own accord? The answer is:] Moshe was worried only for his wife, lest the Egyptians enslave her. But he was not worried for his sons because they would not be enslaved there. This is because the tribe of Leivi was not subjected to the enslavement, as Rashi explained in 5:4. @p1[4]@p2<TIE>He attempted to kill Moshe, his neck became.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 See [Rashi on] v. 4:11.<QC>
@p1[6]@p2<TIE>Through a messenger.@bo [Rashi knows this] because it is written afterwards, “Moshe went out to greet his father-in-law.” Accordingly, “He said.<TIE>.<TIE>. @ITI@it am coming,” is what Yisro told the messenger to say in his name. @p1@p2Go out on account of your wife.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because otherwise the Torah should have written, “I, your father-in-law Yisro, along with your wife.<TIE>.<TIE>. are coming to you.” Why does the verse separate “Yisro” from “Your wife”? Perforce, because Yisro was telling Moshe: “I am coming to you; go out on account of me. But if you do not want.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1@p2And if.<TIE>.<TIE>. not.<TIE>.<TIE>. on account of your wife.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Since Rashi needed to interpret “Your wife” in this manner, he also needed to explain “Her two sons” in this manner. (@ITRe”m@it) But it seems to me that Rashi deduced [this whole explanation, even regarding “Your wife”,] because the verse says the [superfluous] word “I.” (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1[7]@p2<TIE>Once Moshe went out.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: How was Yisro being honored by Moshe going out by himself to greet him? [Furthermore,] Moshe was their king and leader. Is it not a disgrace for the king to go out by himself? Thus Rashi explains that once Moshe went out, Aharon assumedly went out too, etc. Rashi says this [as the simple meaning of the verse, although its source is in various Midrashim,] because of logical reasoning. [Moshe must have intended to honor Yisro when he went out to greet him]. @p1@p2Who is referred to as @HB<HEB>איש@BO<ENG>? That is Moshe.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo Question: Is not Yisro also referred to as @hh<HEB>איש@ee<ENG>, as it says (2:21): “Moshe agreed to reside with the man (@hh<HEB>איש@ee<ENG>)”? It seems [the answer is:] The @hh<HEB>איש@ee<ENG> written about Moshe is superfluous. It could have said, “Moshe was very humble,” [instead of saying, @IT“The man@it Moshe was very humble” (Bamidbar 12:3).] Perforce, it is to show that Moshe is called @hh<HEB>איש@ee<ENG>. However, “Moshe agreed to reside with the man” is the same as writing, “Moshe agreed to reside with Re’uel,” [i.e., Yisro]. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1[8]@p2<TIE>In order to draw his heart to bring him closer to the Torah.@bo [Rashi knows this] because otherwise, why did Moshe tell him? Yisro already heard everything, as it is written: “Yisro heard.<TIE>.<TIE>. about all that Elohim had done” (v. 1).<QC>
@p1[9]@p2<TIE>His flesh had @HB<HEB>חדודין חדודין@BO<ENG>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., it became very creased. Rashi knows this because the Torah varied from [the usual term,] @hh<HEB>וישמח@ee<ENG>, and wrote @hh<HEB>ויחד@ee<ENG> instead. @p1@p2And above all: That He had rescued them.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because otherwise, the verse should just say, “Yisro rejoiced,” [and stop there]. For it would refer to the previous verse, “Moshe told his father-in-law.<TIE>.<TIE>. all that Hashem had done.” But the phrase “Hashem had rescued them” of the previous verse does not teach us [that being rescued from Egypt was above all]. For there, it was speaking of the means by which they were rescued. [I.e., it was speaking of] what was done to Pharaoh and to Egypt. @p1[10]@p2<TIE>As Onkelos translates it.<TIE>.<TIE>. authority and dominion.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi is explaining that “@ITUnder@it the hand of Egypt”] does not mean the same as “@ITFrom@it the hand of Egypt” [written at the beginning of the verse]. For that means “from his possession,” as in: “He took all his land @ITfrom his hand”@it (Bamidbar 21:26), which Rashi there explains as: “From his possession.” [Rashi here knows that “@ITUnder@it the hand of Egypt” means as Onkelos translates] because otherwise, why [does our verse need] both phrases? @p1[11]@p2<TIE>I was aware of Him in the past.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [How does Rashi know this?] Because Rashi is answering the question: @hh<HEB>עתה@ee<ENG> is in the present tense. [Why is it followed by] @hh<HEB>ידעתי@ee<ENG>, which is in the past tense? Therefore Rashi explains, “I was aware of Him in the @ITpast@it, but @ITnow@it.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Alternatively, Rashi is answering the question: In 2:16, [Rashi explained] that Yisro had abandoned idolatry. Why then does it say here, “@ITNow@it I know”? Perforce it means, “Now, all the more so.” [Another approach:] @ITRe”m@it explains that it is because the verse does @ITnot@it say, “Now I know Hashem, and He is greater than all.<TIE>.<TIE>..” Thus we may infer that Yisro knew Him in the past. But only now, after all these deeds [of Hashem], he recognized that His power is greater than that of all the gods. @p1@p2He did not leave any idol.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Otherwise, how would he know [that Hashem is greater than all the gods]? You might object: Referring to Dovid Hamelech it is written, “For I know that Hashem, our Master, is greater than all gods” (Tehillim 135:5). @ITRe”m@it answers: Dovid knew it through practical exploration rather than logical explanation. Whereas Yisro said, “@ITNow@it I know.” I.e., he knew this because of all the deeds that Hashem [just now] did. It was not through the wonders [that He performed]. If so, how did Yisro know this? Perforce, by [comparing Hashem’s deeds to that which he knew from previous] exploration.  Another answer: Here it is written, “Yisro said, ‘I know that Hashem is greater than all @ITthe@it gods.’” Due to the definite article, it means: “.<TIE>.<TIE>.Greater than all the gods, who are known to me @ITand to no one else@it.” How did Yisro know this to be true? Perhaps someone else also explored, as he did, and also has this knowledge. Perforce, [Yisro knew this to be true] because “Yisro did not leave any idol unworshipped.” [But Dovid said, “Greater than all gods,” without the definite article.]  @p1@p2In the pot in which they cooked, they were cooked.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo [Rashi knows this] because it is not written @hh<HEB>אשר הרשיעו@ee<ENG>, [the more usual term. An alternative approach:] It seems to me that Rashi is answering the question: Why did our Sages (Sotah 11a) use cooking in a pot for their analogy? They could have said, “They fell into the pit that they themselves dug,” using Scripture’s own analogy in Koheles 10:8! Perforce, it is because they understood @hh<HEB>זדו@ee<ENG> as in @hh<HEB>ויזד יעקב נזיד@ee<ENG> (Bereishis 25:29).<QC>
@p1[13]@p2<TIE>And to what does @HB<HEB>ממחרת@BO<ENG> refer.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 It cannot refer to the day after they ate and drank [as mentioned in v. 12. For if so,] the Torah would not be using this as an indication [when this event took place], for we still do not know on what day [they ate and drank]! Perforce, it was the day after Moshe’s descent from the mountain. And [the date of] descending the mountain is clearly understood from the Torah [as Rashi explains]. @p1@p2Even according to one who says that Yisro came before the giving of the Torah.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 According to the view that Yisro came @ITafter@it the giving of the Torah, the @ITparsha@it obviously is not recorded in order. Since [the giving of the Torah is not stated until the next chapter,] even the beginning of the @ITparsha —@it when Yisro came — is not in order. Rather, Rashi is explaining that even if Yisro came @ITbefore@it the Torah, it still is not in order. Until this verse the sequence is indeed in order, but from here on, it is not. @p1@p2Until the second year.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 This is according to regular years, i.e., counting from Tishrei. Rashi is bringing another proof that beginning from this verse, the @ITparsha@it is not recorded in order, as he continues to explain: “For it says here.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1@p2Where do we find that he returned?@p3 [You might ask: Why is this a proof? Many events are not expressly stated in the Torah! The answer is:] If Yisro was sent away after the giving of the Torah, then [even if he returned,] the Torah does not mention his return because it is of no importance. He already accepted Torah and mitzvos. But if he was sent away before the giving of the Torah, [he must have returned, as Rashi proved. And then] he came to accept the Torah, which is the main purpose of his coming. The narrative would then mention his return, so people will not say that Yisro came once, and only in order to bring Moshe’s wife and sons — for his return is not mentioned. See all this in @ITRe”m@it, who wrote at great length, citing various versions of Rashi and discussing them. The main point is as I wrote. @p1@p2He was not showing proper respect to Yisrael.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 The Ibn Ezra objected that this was not disrespectful, for judges always sit while the litigants stand. @ITRe”m@it writes that this is no objection: Yisro was displeased that @ITeveryone@it stood, even those who had no litigation. He thought that they stood before Moshe to afford him princely honor. [Alternatively,] the @ITMaharshal@it wrote that this is no question: litigants stand (Devarim 19:17) only during the hearing. But with Moshe they stood even before the hearing, for Moshe was the only judge and they were unable to come before him [immediately]. Sometimes they would stand until the evening, waiting to come before him. For this, Yisro reproved him. (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1@p2Can this be taken literally.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 This @ITparsha@it speaks of the day after Yom Kippur, when Moshe needed to gather Yisrael and command them to build the @ITMishkan@it. If so, how could he have sat to judge from morning to evening? @p1@p2As if he has become a participant with Hashem.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Since the world’s existence depends on judgment. The proof is that the Flood [destroyed the world, and it] came because there was no judgment among them and people were robbing each other. As it is written, “The land was filled with robbery” (Bereishis 6:13). Therefore, he who judges truthfully supports the world’s existence, and it is as if he is partnership with Hashem.<QC>
@p1[15]@p2<TIE>[The same as:] @HB<HEB>כי בא@BO<ENG> in the present tense.@p3 I.e., @hh<HEB>כי יבא@ee<ENG> is not in the future tense, otherwise Moshe would not have sat before they came to seek instruction. @p1[16]@p2<TIE>Whoever has the matter comes to me.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Why does it begin in plural: [@hh<HEB>להם@ee<ENG>], but conclude in singular: @hb<HEB>בא@hh אלי@ee<ENG>? Thus Rashi explains: “Whoever has.<TIE>.<TIE>.” [In vs. 15-16,] Moshe is answering Yisro, who thought that Moshe’s sitting is [inappropriate] princely behavior. [The thrust of] Moshe’s answer is only, “I judge between man and his neighbor.” I.e., Moshe is answering that the people stand for judgment, not for his honor. [The thrust of] Moshe’s answer is not, “I impart to them Hashem’s statutes and His laws,” [which, taken on its own, could] mean that he is teaching them [and not judging them. This would not answer Yisro] because [in the early generations] both master and disciple stood while studying. Due to the fact [that everything revolves around, “I judge between man and his neighbor,”] Rashi explains that [everything] refers to judgment — even @hh<HEB>כי יבא@ee@BO@p3<ENG> in v. 15, and @hh<HEB>כי יהיה להם דבר@ee<ENG> in this verse. This is against [the simple understanding of] Onkelos, [that v. 15 speaks of teaching, not judgment].<QC>
@p1[17]@p2<TIE>As a way to honor him.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo Why did Rashi not make this comment before, where it said, “Moshe’s father-in-law saw” (v. 14)? The answer is: This verse here is preceded by (v. 15), “Moshe said to @IThis@it father-in-law.” So here it should say, “@ITHis@it father-in-law said,” not, “@ITMoshe’s@it father-in-law said.” Thus Rashi explains that [Moshe was mentioned] as a way to honor Yisro. And this is why Rashi did not make this comment before. @p1[18]@p2<TIE>This includes Aharon, Chur.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Question: Was not Chur killed when they made the Golden Calf, and this @ITparsha@it comes afterward? The answer is: Rashi mentions Chur according to a different Aggadah which opines that Chur was not killed when they made the Golden Calf. According to the first Aggadah, @hh<HEB>גם אתה@ee<ENG> includes only Aharon and the seventy elders. (@ITMaharshal@it)<QC>
@p1[21]@p2<TIE>Through the Divine Spirit which is upon you.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because @hh<HEB>תחזה@ee<ENG> is an expression related to @hh<HEB>חזיון@ee<ENG> (prophetic vision). Otherwise, it should say @hh<HEB>תבחר@ee<ENG> (choose). Alternatively, [Rashi knows this] because otherwise, how would Moshe be able to choose the capable and the truthful from among 600,000 men? @p1@p2Any judge from whom property is taken.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 @ITRe”m@it writes: The adage which Rashi cited does not exactly fit the point of discussion. [This is because property, if taken away through litigation, is not their @ITown@it property. On the contrary, it rightfully belongs to the other party.] The answer [to the @ITRe”m@it is as follows: Rashi’s adage] refers to the case [stated in Midrash Tanchuma, Yisro ch. 2] where one litigant says to the judge, “If you do not rule in my favor, I will burn down your house.” The judge rules in his favor, out of fear. Yet, the judge knows that the other litigant will sue him for the false ruling, and the judge will have to compensate him [from his own property] for the loss he caused him. About this Rashi said, “Any judge from whom property is taken through litigation.” In other words: Any judge who must pay money because he ruled against the innocent party is not fit to be a judge, for it is written: “Do not fear any man” (Devarim 1:17). @p1[22]@p2<TIE>@HB<HEB>וידונון@BO<ENG> — an expression of a command.@p3 It means “They shall always judge,” which is called the “future progressive” tense. I.e., they will always be judging. But the second @hh<HEB>ושפטו@ee<ENG> (v. 26) is translated by Onkelos as @hh<HEB>ודיינין@ee<ENG>, which means: “They were always judging.” This is called the “past progressive” tense.<QC>
@p1@p2The present tense.@p3 I.e., it is not an expression of a command because the above-mentioned appointing of the judges already made things easier, and no further action is necessary. It means, “This is the way to make things easier; not any other way.” @p1[23]@p2<TIE>If He will command you to do so.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [The verse literally means: “Hashem @ITwill@it command you, and you will be able to survive.” Thus] Rashi explains that it [should be understood] as if it said: “@ITIf@it Hashem commands you, then you will be able to survive.” For how could it mean, “Hashem @ITwill @itcommand you”? How did Yisro know that Hashem will command Moshe to do as he proposed? @p1@p2And the seventy elders.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [How does Rashi know this? An answer is:] Because it cannot mean the litigants. For in the desert, there were no farmers or craftsmen who would miss work by [standing and] waiting. Although the Torah seemingly says that Moshe was judging alone, our Sages interpret “You, and also this people” (v. 18) to mean that Moshe was accompanied by the elders even before Yisro’s advice. (@ITRe”m@it) [An alternative answer:] @hh<HEB>גם@ee<ENG> comes to include Aharon and the elders, and @hh<HEB>כל@ee<ENG> comes to include Nadav and Avihu, who were not yet elders. Rashi did not want to mention Chur here, since one Midrash says he had already died, so there is no point in mentioning him. (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1[27]@p2<TIE>Converting his family.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because otherwise, why was the sending attributed to Moshe? Perforce, because it was to convert Yisro’s family. And [the Torah considers] this to Moshe’s credit, for it is written, “The children of Keini, @ITMoshe’s father-in-law@it, ascended from the city of palm trees with the children of Yehudah.<TIE>.<TIE>. and dwelt among the people” (Shoftim 1:16). @p1[1]@p2<TIE>The first day of the month.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo [Rashi knows this] because here it is written, @hh<HEB>ביום הזה@ee<ENG>, and there (12:2) it is written @hh<HEB>החודש הזה@ee<ENG>. There it means the first day of the month, so here too it means the first day of the month. @p1@p2Why is @HB<HEB>ביום הזה@BO<ENG> written.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Question: Since @hh<HEB>ביום הזה@ee<ENG> is needed to teach that it is the first of the month, how can it also teach that words of Torah should be as new to you (as though they were given today)? The answer is:] In the Mechilta it says, “‘On that very day they came to the desert of Sinai.’ This was on the first of the month. Thus it is written, ‘In the third month.’” It seems the Mechilta means as follows: the intent of the verse is not to conceal, but to explain. Yet it says @hh<HEB>בחדש השלישי .<TIE>.<TIE>. ביום הזה@ee<ENG>, not stating which day it was. Perforce, it means the first of the month. This is because the first of the month is called @hh<HEB>חודש@ee<ENG>, as in (Shmuel I, 20:18): “Tomorrow is the @hh<HEB>חודש@ee<ENG> (first of the month),” and as in (Melachim II, 4:23): “It is neither the @hh<HEB>חודש@ee<ENG> (first of the month) nor Shabbos.” So when it says @hh<HEB>ב@hbחודש@hh השלישי@ee<ENG>, [we understand that it was the first of the month]. Accordingly, Rashi asks: Why did it not say @hh<HEB>ביום ההוא@ee<ENG>? Even without the @ITgezeirah shavah@it [between @hh<HEB>ביום הזה@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>החודש הזה@ee<ENG>, see previous entry,] we still would learn from @hh<HEB>ב@hbחודש@hh השלישי@ee<ENG> that it was the first of the month. Perforce, it says @hh<HEB>ביום הזה@ee<ENG> to teach that words of Torah should be as new to you (as though they were given today). This answers @ITRe”m@it’s questions. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1[2]@p2<TIE>Just as their arrival at Sinai was of repentance.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo For it is written, @hh<HEB>ויחן שם ישראל@ee<ENG>. [Since @hh<HEB>ויחן@ee<ENG> is in the singular form], it implies: “As one person.” @p1@p2Wherever you find “opposite” it means facing to the east.@p3 Rashi is not saying that @hh<HEB>נגד@ee<ENG> @ITalways@it means eastward, for it is written (Bamidbar 2:2), “They shall encamp around the Tent of Meeting, @ITfrom a distance@it @hh<HEB>(מנגד)@ee<ENG>.” There it does not mean toward the east, [for they encamped on all sides]. Rather, Rashi means that wherever @hh<HEB>נגד@ee<ENG> refers to an opposite side, [it is toward the east]. This is because @hh<HEB>נגד@ee<ENG> conveys facing something, [i.e., they are “faceto-face.”] And east is called @hh<HEB>פנים@ee<ENG>, “face.” [See Iyov 23:8]. (@ITRe”m@it) @p1[3]@p2<TIE>On the second day.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because the intent of the verse is not to conceal, but to explain. And since we find elsewhere that when Moshe ascended the mountain it was early in the morning, we cannot say that here Moshe ascended on the day they came [at some unspecified time]. Also, we cannot say that Moshe ascended [early in the morning] on the third of the month, for it is written (v. 8), “Moshe brought the words of the people.” This was on the day following [Moshe’s ascent], i.e., the third of the month, [as Rashi explains there]. And it is written (v. 9), “Moshe told the words of the people.<TIE>.<TIE>.” which was on the fourth of the month, as Rashi explains there. Therefore, if Moshe first ascended on the third of the month, [everything would be pushed one day later and] the giving of Torah would not be on the sixth of the month.<QC>
@p1@p2And in this order.@p3 I.e., first to the women, and then to the men. @p1@p2Say it to them in a gentle voice.@p3 See @ITRe”m@it on this. It seems to me that [Rashi knows this] because we find that @hh<HEB>דיבור@ee<ENG> is speaking in a harsh manner, as in: “The man in charge of all the land spoke (@hh<HEB>דבר@ee<ENG>) to us harshly” (Bereishis 42:30). Thus we may deduce that @hh<HEB>אמירה@ee<ENG> is speaking in a gentle manner. Furthermore, it is written: “And Yoseif said (@hh<HEB>ויאמר@ee<ENG>) to his brothers, ‘I am Yoseif’” (ibid. 45:3). And it is written: “Yoseif said (@hh<HEB>ויאמר@ee<ENG>) to his brothers, ‘Please approach’” (ibid. v. 4). And it is written: “Yoseif said (@hh<HEB>ויאמר@ee<ENG>) to them, ‘Do not fear’” (ibid. 50:19). From all these we see that @hh<HEB>ויאמר@ee<ENG> is gentle speech. @p1[4]@p2<TIE>You do not receive it as a tradition.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Here Rashi is answering the question: Why does it say, “You @ITsaw@it”? Furthermore, “seeing” applies only to things that are done, not to the act of doing. Furthermore, it is evident that the verse comes to inform B’nei Yisrael that Hashem loves them, for it concludes: “I carried you on wings of eagles.” But [you might ask:] How is His love of them apparent from what He did to Egypt? Perhaps Hashem so dealt with Egypt because they sinned, and not because He loves B’nei Yisrael. Thus Rashi explains, “There were many sins.<TIE>.<TIE>. yet I did not punish them.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (@ITRe”m@it) @p1@p2They all gathered at Raamses.@p3 In 12:37 it states, “B’nei Yisrael traveled from Raamses to Sukkos,” and Rashi there comments: “The distance was 120 @ITmil@it, but they came there in a moment, as it says: ‘I carried you on wings of eagles’ (19:4).” [If so, why does] Rashi say here that “carried you on wings of eagles” refers to gathering @ITat@it Raamses? [The answer is:] Both explanations are correct. @p1@p2As an eagle which carries.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 The @ITRe”m@it’s version of Rashi says: “An alternate explanation: As an eagle.<TIE>.<TIE>.” And so it is in the Mechilta. For there are two different explanations here. In the first, [“wings of eagles”] refers to swiftness of an eagle, and the second refers to the manner by which an eagle “carries its fledglings on its wings.”<QC>
@p1[5]@p2<TIE>If you will now accept it.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi says, “@ITIf@it you will now accept,” because all words that stipulate conditions, such as @hh<HEB>אם@ee<ENG> in this verse, are time related. This is why Rashi switches the order of the verse’s words, and explains it: @ITIf now@it, at this time, you will accept the yoke of Torah, it will be pleasant for you @ITin the future@it. However, in the verse’s simple reading, the conditional word @hh<HEB>אם@ee<ENG> refers to accepting the mitzvos. Accordingly it would mean, “@ITIf@it you accept the mitzvos,” and thus would not convey, “It will be pleasant for you from here @ITon@it” — i.e., at a future time. (@ITRe”m@it) @p1@p2Regarding the observance of the Torah.@p3 I.e., “My covenant” does not refer to the covenant that was already established, i.e., that of Shabbos or of circumcision. [Rashi knows this] because it is evident that Scripture is speaking of the covenant of the Torah, which is the main subject in this passage. @p1[9]@p2<TIE>The thickness of the cloud which is called @HB<HEB>ערפל@BO<ENG>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Why are two terms [@hh<HEB>עב@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>ענן@ee<ENG>] necessary? @hh<HEB>עב@ee<ENG> also means cloud, as in (Yeshayah 19:1): “Behold, Hashem rides on a swift cloud (@hh<HEB>עב@ee<ENG>),” and as in (Melachim I 18:44): “Behold, there was a small cloud (@hh<HEB>עב@ee<ENG>) like a man’s palm.” Thus Rashi explains that here, @hh<HEB>עב@ee<ENG> refers to the thickness (@hh<HEB>עובי@ee<ENG>) of the cloud. This is @hh<HEB>ערפל@ee<ENG>, which is thicker than an ordinary cloud. @p1@p2On the following day.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [It could not have been the same day] because Moshe always ascended the mountain early in the morning. @p1@p2As hearing from the King.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Since Hashem responded to Moshe: “For on the third day, Hashem will descend.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (v. 11), we may infer that Moshe had said this, and that the people had requested it. But @ITRe”m,@it citing the Mechilta, explains [that we know this] because otherwise, what could B’nei Yisrael have told Moshe to say to Hashem?<QC>
@p1[11]@p2<TIE>Separated from their wives.@bo This is learned by a @ITgezeirah shavah@it between @hh<HEB>נכונים@ee<ENG> here and @hh<HEB>נכונים@ee<ENG> in v. 15. Here it is written @hh<HEB>והיו נכונים@ee<ENG>, and there it is written @hh<HEB>היו נכונים לשלשת ימים אל תגשו אל אשה@ee<ENG> (“.<TIE>.<TIE>.do not come near a woman”). @p1@p2This teaches us that there were no blind among them.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 This was in response to their request, “It is our wish to @ITsee@it our King!” @p1[12]@p2<TIE>The boundary says to them.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 @ITRe”m@it explains [that Rashi knows this] because “Set bounds for the people” cannot mean “Tell them to be careful.” This is because setting bounds for an area and warning people are two different things. Therefore, [since the verse is not speaking of Moshe’s verbal warning, we must say that] @hh<HEB>לאמר@ee<ENG> is connected to the boundary, not to Moshe. However, the Torah never punishes without a verbal warning. Therefore Rashi adds, “And you, too, warn them,” for Moshe also told them to be careful. This being so, @hh<HEB>לאמר@ee<ENG> connects to Moshe as well as to the boundary. @p1@p2@BIEven@BO its edge.@bo [Rashi knows this] because otherwise, [if @hh<HEB>ונגוע@ee<ENG> meant literally, “@ITAnd@it touch its edge,”] it would not need to say, “Not to go up the mountain.” For it is impossible to go up without [first] touching its edge. (@ITRe”m@it) [A second approach:] I heard from a certain sage that Rashi is telling us not to think that, “Not to go up the mountain and touch its edge,” refers to its @ITuppermost@it edge. Therefore Rashi explains, “@ITEven@it its edge.” Alternatively, [now returning to the first approach:] It seems to me that Rashi means as follows: “Be careful not to go up” implies not to ascend, but standing at a distance and touching is permitted. Therefore Rashi explains that “And touch its edge” means: “Even to stand at a distance and touch its edge.” (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1[13]@p2<TIE>From here we learn that those who are stoned.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because of the repetitive @hh<HEB>ירה יירה@ee<ENG>, [which teaches that “cast down” applies not just at Mt. Sinai]. @p1@p2It is a sign of the departing.@p3 This is because singers and musicians make a long, drawn-out note at the end. The ceasing of the sound signified the departing of the Shechinah, which had arrived accompanied by sounds, lightning and horn-blasts. After the Shechinah departed, they were allowed to ascend the mountain. (@ITRe”m@it) @p1@p2The horn of Yitzchok’s ram.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because it is written @hh<HEB>במשוך @hbה@hhיובל@ee<ENG>, implying a certain horn. This is the horn of Yitzchok’s ram, about which it is written (Yeshayah 27:13), “On that day He will sound a great horn.” (@ITMaharshal@it) The Ramban asks: Was not Yitzchok’s ram offered as an @ITolah,@it thus its horns and hoofs were burnt [on the Altar]? @ITRe”m@it answers: Perhaps the horns were removed while the ram was still alive, in which case they would not be burned, although they may not be used for non-sacrificial purposes. Alternatively, they were removed after the ram’s blood was cast on the Altar [but before the ram was placed on the fire], in which case they may be used even for non-sacrificial purposes. @p1[15]@p2<TIE>By the end of three days.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo [Rashi knows this] because it is not written @hh<HEB>ליום השלישי@ee<ENG>, as Hashem commanded Moshe — but rather @hh<HEB>לשלושת ימים@ee<ENG>, implying when three days have already passed.<QC>
@p1@p2The woman might expel the seed.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 You might ask: Why was the Torah particular about impurity from seed, and not about impurity from @ITzav, tzaraas@it or relations with a @ITnidah@it? Tosafos in Shabbos 86a already answered: [In earlier times, someone impure from seed was forbidden to study Torah]. See there. @p1[17]@p2<TIE>This tells that the Shechinah came out.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Meaning: The word @hh<HEB>לקראת@ee<ENG> is used only when two parties approach one another, as in: “Behold, he (Aharon) is setting out to meet you” (4:14).<QC>
@p1@p2And arched over them like a barrel.@p3 You might ask: Since they had already said (24:7), “We will do and we will listen,” [why was this necessary]? Tosafos in Shabbos 88a already answered: Because they might otherwise retract when they see the great fire, and their souls depart. A further answer: They said, “We will do and we will listen,” regarding the Written Torah. But the mountain arched over them so they will accept the Oral Torah. It was for their benefit that Hashem forced them, as now the Shechinah will not leave them and He will not cast them off. For it is written regarding a woman forced into relations (Devarim 22:19): “She shall be his wife; he may not cast her away all his days.” (@ITMahara”i@it) @p1[18]@p2<TIE>And he did not translate it @HB<HEB>תננא@BO<ENG>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 As he translated @hh<HEB>כעשן הכבשן@ee<ENG>.<QC>
@p1[21]@p2<TIE>Warn them.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi says that @hh<HEB>העד@ee<ENG>, which usually means “testify,” here means “warn.”] It is like (Bereishis 43:3), “The man warned (@hh<HEB>העד@ee<ENG>) us.” Warning is expressed as @hh<HEB>עדות@ee<ENG> because it is ordinarily delivered before witnesses. @p1@p2That they not break down their position.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because @hh<HEB>הריסה@ee<ENG> applies only to things separating from one another, such as the separation of [the parts of] a building, or separating people who are positioned [together]. @p1@p2Even if only one.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because otherwise, it should have said @hh<HEB>ונפל@hbו@ee<ENG>, [the plural form, rather than @hh<HEB>ונפל@ee<ENG>]. Thus he explains, “Any of them that will die.<TIE>.<TIE>.”<QC>
@p1[24]@p2<TIE>One might think they, too.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 “They, too” refers to the @ITkohanim@it [and not the people. This is evident because later,] Rashi mentions the [area of the] @ITkohanim@it, but does not write: “.<TIE>.<TIE>.And the people.” [Rashi knows that the @ITkohanim@it were closer to Moshe] because it is impossible for the people, too, to be with Moshe. For if so, to whom would “Do not break through” apply? [Everyone would be with Moshe!] Perforce, [it is as Rashi said]. Rashi is saying as follows: If you suggest that the @ITkohanim@it are included in the warning, “Do not break through,” [for they are with the people,] why did it not say @hh<HEB>ואהרן עמך והעם אל יהרסו@ee<ENG>, [omitting @hh<HEB>והכהנים@ee<ENG>]? This would convey that the @ITkohanim@it, too, should not break through. But the verse states @hh<HEB>והכהנים@ee<ENG>. If so, perhaps @hh<HEB>והכהנים@ee<ENG> should be read with the preceding, thus the @ITkohanim@it are with Moshe? Therefore the verse says @hh<HEB>ועלית @hbאתה@ee<ENG>, to exclude [a certain set of people from being with Moshe]. But since the excluding @hh<HEB>אתה@ee<ENG> is written before @hh<HEB>ואהרן@ee<ENG>, perhaps it implies that Aharon, too, is excluded. Therefore it says @hh<HEB>עמך@ee<ENG>, to indicate that Aharon is indeed with Moshe in the same area — he is not with the @ITkohanim@it. [To resolve these seemingly contradictory inferences,] we are forced to conclude that @hh<HEB>אתה@ee<ENG> means Moshe has his own area, not with Aharon. And Aharon has his own area, not with the @ITkohanim,@it for it says @hh<HEB>עמך@ee<ENG>. And “they”, the @ITkohanim@it, have their own area, not with the people. @ITRe”m,@it [who does not grant the @ITkohanim@it their own area], happened upon a different version of Rashi. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it; see there.) @p1[1]@p2<TIE>Elohim refers only to Judge.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo Although it says: “In the beginning @ITElohim@it created” (Bereishis 1:1), and: “@ITElohim@it said to Noach” (ibid. 8:15), and: “@ITElohim@it called to him from the midst of the thorn-bush” (Shemos 3:4), see @ITRe”m@it here and in 6:2 [for an explanation of these verses]. @p1@p2But if he does not fulfill them he does not receive .<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 This applies when it is not a time of [Hashem’s] anger. But in a time of anger, Hashem punishes for any mitzvah that is not fulfilled. This is evident from Menachos 41a; see there. @p1@p2Why does the Torah repeat: “I am Hashem” and “You must not have”.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi means as follows: Since they were all said in one utterance, why does it say in Tehillim 62:12: “Elohim spoke one utterance, and I heard @ITtwo@it”? This implies that only “I am Hashem” and “You must not have” were said in one utterance, but actually all of them were said in one utterance. Rashi answers, “Because He explicitly repeated.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Rashi is saying that they all were said in one utterance, but when Hashem repeated [i.e., explained] them we heard only [the first] two directly from Him. The rest were repeated by Moshe. @p1@p2“Yes” to a positive command.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Wherever @hh<HEB>וידבר@ee<ENG> is written it always speaks in general, while @hh<HEB>לאמר@ee<ENG> introduces the specifics. But here, the specifics are clearly stated: “All these words.” If so, why does it say @hh<HEB>לאמר@ee<ENG> afterward? Perforce, to teach us [that they replied “Yes.<TIE>.<TIE>.”]. (@ITRe”m@it) @p1[2]@p2<TIE>The act of bringing you out is sufficient.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Why is His Godliness associated with the Exodus, rather than with Creation? Why did the Torah not write, “I am Hashem, your God, who created Heaven and Earth”? @p1@p2Since He revealed Himself at the Sea as One Who is powerful at war.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., His Godliness is associated with the Exodus, but not regarding @ITall@it His actions [in the Exodus]. Rather, “Since He revealed Himself at the Sea.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Rashi cites, “And under His feet.<TIE>.<TIE>.” to show that Hashem’s attributes change according to the situation. And though in the verse it is written, “Who brought you out of @ITEgypt@it,” Rashi nevertheless explains it as, “He revealed Himself at the@IT Reed Sea@it,” because that was the culmination of the Exodus from Egypt. @p1@p2Do not think that there are two dominions.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo Meaning: Just as you acknowledge that I was One at the splitting of the Sea, for there it is written (15:2) @hh<HEB>זה אלי ואנוהו@ee<ENG> (in the singular form), so too, you should believe that I am that same God. Therefore Rashi explains, “I am the [same] One Who has brought you out of the Land of Egypt. (@ITRe”m@it) @p1@p2An alternate explanation: Because they had heard many sounds.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: According to the first explanation, [“The act of bringing you out is sufficient,”] the verse should say only: “Who brought you out of the house of slaves.” Why does it say also, “From the land of Egypt”? Therefore Rashi brings the second explanation, [“Since He revealed Himself at the Reed Sea.<TIE>.<TIE>.”]. According to both explanations there is a question: Why does it first say, “I am Hashem,” and only afterward, “You must not have any other gods”? First it should forbid other gods, and then say, “I am Hashem,” conveying: “I alone.” It is not the way to first command a certain action and then forbid an action that is its opposite. Therefore Rashi brings an alternate explanation: “Because they had heard many sounds.<TIE>.<TIE>.” So they immediately thought there were many dominions. Therefore, it was necessary to say right at the beginning, “I am Hashem.<TIE>.<TIE>.” to convey that there are no dominions besides Me. (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1[3]@p2<TIE>Once it has been made, how.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 This refers to an idol that neither he made, nor did others make it for him. It was already made, and he either found it or bought it. How would we know that he may not keep it in his possession? The Torah therefore says: “You must not have” — in every case. (@ITRe”m@it)<QC>
@p1@p2As long as I exist.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 It is commonly asked: Rashi in Devarim 5:7 explains @hh<HEB>על פני@ee<ENG> as follows: “Wherever I am, i.e., the entire world. An alternate explanation: As long as I exist.” [Why does Rashi here omit the first explanation?] The answer is: There, Rashi is addressing a different difficulty. It is written there (Devarim 4:25), “When you have been @ITin the Land@it for a long time.<TIE>.<TIE>. and make a statue,” implying that the prohibition on idolatry applies only to the Land [of Yisrael]. Yet there, the Ten Commandments are preceded by: “It was not with our fathers that Hashem made this covenant [against idolatry], but @ITwith us@it” (ibid 5:3). This implies that the prohibition of idolatry applies to the person, and it must be observed [not only in the Eretz Yisrael] in all places. Therefore these two verses seemingly contradict each other.  In light of this, Rashi in Devarim first explains @hh<HEB>על פני@ee<ENG> as, “Wherever I am,” [thus teaching that the prohibition against idolatry applies in all places]. This is in order to resolve the contradiction. But if so, why is it written, “When you have been @ITin the Land@it”? [The answer is:] Because the [former] people of the Land were more steeped in idolatry than the other nations. Therefore the verse singles out “the Land” because the B’nei Yisrael needed a stronger warning pertaining to the idolatry in the Land. @p1[4]@p2<TIE>Because it is carved.@p3 It is from the same root as (34:1) “Carve out @hh<HEB>פסל לך@ee<ENG>, two stone tablets for yourself.” @p1@p2A picture of any thing in the heavens.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi explains this so we will not think @hh<HEB>תמונה@ee<ENG> is the name of a certain idol [whose image may not be made]. Furthermore, [Rashi says this] because a picture of heaven cannot be made. A picture is a property of an entity; one cannot make a picture that stands [independent of a material entity]. Therefore Rashi explains: “Of any @ITthing@it in the heavens,” such as stars in the shape of Aries or of Taurus. @p1[5]@p2<TIE>He is jealous to exact punishment.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., He intends to exact punishment [if He has not yet done so]. And if He has already punished, this demonstrates His jealousy, for He punishes because of jealousy. @p1@p2When they retain in their hands the deeds.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because otherwise, it [contradicts what] is written (Devarim 24:16): “Fathers shall not be put to death for the children, [and children shall not be put to death for their fathers].”<QC>
@p1[6]@p2<TIE>That a person does.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Question: Why does Rashi write @hh<HEB>ונוצר חסד@ee<ENG>, from 34:7, when here it is written @hh<HEB>ועושה חסד@ee<ENG>? The answer is: So we will not mistakenly think that @hh<HEB>ועושה חסד@ee<ENG> refers to Hashem. I.e., that Hashem does lovingkindness for two thousand generations, but no more. [This is not so,] for it is written: “Hashem’s kindness is never-ending, His mercy does not cease” (Eichah 3:22). Thus Rashi brings the verse of @hh<HEB>ונוצר חסד@ee<ENG>, which means: when a @ITperson@it does loving-kindness, Hashem stores reward for him for two thousand generations. And so too, the verse of @hh<HEB>ועושה חסד@ee<ENG> refers to the person, [not to Hashem]. It means: when a person does loving-kindness, Hashem rewards until two thousand generations. @p1@p2Measure for reward is greater.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Question: Why does Rashi need to tell us this simple mathematical calculation? The answer is: Rashi is resolving a difficulty with the verse in which is written that Hashem rewards for two thousand generations. This cannot mean as it seems, for the world lasts only six thousand years, so from beginning to end is less than one thousand generations! Thus Rashi explains that the verse only comes to teach how much greater is Hashem’s measure for reward. (@ITKitzur Mizrachi@it)<QC>
@p1[7]@p2<TIE>One who swears for naught and meaninglessly.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is explaining that we should not think Onkelos’s translation of @hh<HEB>למגנא@ee<ENG>, “for nothing,” implies that the one who swears derives no benefit from it — but if he would derive benefit, it would be permitted. Therefore Rashi explains that it means @hh<HEB>להבל@ee<ENG>, i.e., an empty and meaningless oath. (@ITGur Aryeh@it) See Shavuos 29a, which lists four types of vain oaths. @p1[8]@p2<TIE>@HB<HEB>זכור@BO<ENG> and @HB<HEB>שמור@BO<ENG> were said in one utterance.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 You might object: Those other verses [that Rashi quotes] are not similar to @hh<HEB>זכור@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>שמור@ee<ENG>. Those contradict one another, while @hh<HEB>זכור@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>שמור@ee<ENG> do not. An answer is: Also @hh<HEB>זכור@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>שמור@ee<ENG> contradict. @hh<HEB>זכור@ee<ENG> is a positive mitzvah, while @hh<HEB>שמור@ee<ENG> is a negative one. As it says in Zevachim 106a that @hh<HEB>השמר לך@ee<ENG>, @hh<HEB>פן@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>אל@ee<ENG> all signify a negative mitzvah. [And @hh<HEB>שמור@ee<ENG> is similar to @hh<HEB>השמר לך@ee<ENG>.] [So when later it is written @hh<HEB>שמור@ee<ENG>, it seemed as though the mitzvah of Shabbos had been changed from a positive one to a negative one.] (@ITRamban@it) A further answer: [@hh<HEB>זכור@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>שמור@ee<ENG> contradict one another because] @hh<HEB>זכור@ee<ENG> implies that one should remember not to do work. It is an active term, forbidding the worker to work, but not requiring that no work is done. However @hh<HEB>שמור@ee<ENG> implies guarding that no work be done. Perforce, @hh<HEB>זכור@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>שמור@ee<ENG> were said in one utterance.<QC>
@p1@p2To constantly remember the Shabbos day.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., you should constantly be remembering. This is different from @hh<HEB>זכור ברית אברהם@ee<ENG>, which means, “Remember it @ITnow@it.” However, remembering Shabbos is continuously ongoing. The word @hh<HEB>זכור@ee<ENG> is neither in the infinitive form nor in the imperative form. If it were in the infinitive form, it would not convey taking action [on what one remembers], but [remembering it by] thought alone. And if it were in the imperative form, the @hh<HEB>ז@ee<ENG> would not have a @ITkametz@it. Rather, it is an intermediate form between thought and action. Therefore Rashi explains: “Take heed to constantly remember.<TIE>.<TIE>. set it aside for Shabbos.” @p1@p2So that if you happen upon.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Ramban objects: This is against the Halachah, which follows Beis Hillel. In Beitzah 16a it says that the elder Shammai always “ate” in honor of Shabbos. [The Gemara continues and explains that] when Shammai would find a fine animal, he would set it aside for Shabbos. If he then found a finer one, he would eat the first one and put the second one for Shabbos.<TIE>.<TIE>. but Hillel conducted himself differently, as it is said (Tehillim 68:20) “Blessed is Hashem day by day.” [He would not put aside fine items for Shabbos, but he would trust that Hashem would provide fine items later.] @ITRe”m@it answers: Beis Shammai and Beis Hillel disagree regarding food items, and the Halachah indeed follows Beis Hillel. But Hillel agrees with Shammai regarding other items, [for they are less readily available]. And here Rashi is speaking pertaining to other items. However, it seems to me that all this is unnecessary. The Halachah always follows Beis Hillel, except in this case — since Hillel himself, who stated this law, does not disagree with Shammai regarding this matter. It is evident that he does not disagree, since the Gemara says: “Hillel @ITconducted@it himself differently.” This implies that Hillel did not opine that this is the law. He merely conducted himself in this manner. (@ITMaharshal@it)<QC>
@p1[10]@p2<TIE>Because his Shabbos rest is upon you.@p3 This is true only if he does the work for the adult’s sake. Otherwise, we neither tell him to extinguish it, nor do we tell him not to. The adult is commanded not to directly cause the minor to do work. (@ITRe”m@it) However, since Rashi quotes the Mishnah [of the minor who offers to extinguish the fire] word-for-word [and does not take its ruling and apply it to a specific case,] it seems to me to imply that adults must stop the minor [in every case, even when the minor does the work for his own sake]. Rashi explains this law also in Vayikra 11:13, regarding eating non-kosher fowl, and in Vayikra 17:12, regarding consuming blood, and in Vayikra 21:1, regarding kohanim defiling themselves@IT.@it [And in those places, it presumably is not for the adult’s sake.] (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it)<QC>
@p1[11]@p2<TIE>By giving twice as much on Friday, a “double bread”.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 See Bereishis 2:3, and Shemos 16:22. @p1[12]@p2<TIE>From the positive to the negative.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because the Ten Commandments are all negative mitzvos, except for the first, which is essential and the basis for all the mitzvos. Therefore Rashi explains that also this one is a negative commandment, for “inference may be made from the positive to the negative.”<QC>
@p1[15]@p2<TIE>This teaches that not one among them.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 You might ask: Did we not already learn this from, “In the sight of all the people” (19:11), as Rashi explained there? The answer is: Here it teaches that they did not go blind after the giving of the Torah. For even if someone looks at the @ITkohanim’s@it hands while they bless the people [in the Beis Hamikdosh] his eyesight dims, as R. Chagai said in the Talmud Yerushalmi. And this is on account of the Shechinah’s presence upon the @ITkohanim’s@it hands. [And we would think this applies] here even more so, since the people saw an even greater revelation of the Shechinah. @p1@p2Which came from the Almighty.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: @hh<HEB>וכל העם רואים את @hbהקולות@hh@ee<ENG> seems to have been before the giving of the Torah, for it is written above (19:16): @hh<HEB>ויהי @hbקולות@hh וברקים@ee<ENG>. If so, why was not “They trembled and stood far off” written above, before the Ten Commandments? Therefore Rashi explains that the @hh<HEB>קולות@ee<ENG> mentioned here refer to [Hashem’s uttering] the Ten Commandments, [not of the thunder that preceded]. @p1@p2The root word @HB<HEB>נוע@BO<ENG> means @HB<HEB>זיע@BO<ENG>.@p3 It is an expression meaning @hb<HEB>זיע@hh ורתת@ee<ENG> (shaking). It is not an expression meaning @hb<HEB>נע@hh ונד@ee<ENG> (wandering). For afterwards it is written, “And stood far off.” @p1@p2Twelve @BImil@BO, the distance of their encampment.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 You might ask: How does Rashi know they went back twelve @ITmil@it, not less? The answer is: Since it is written, “Stood far off,” we may infer that until now they [all] were standing near. Even those at the back of the camp were near. And the length of their encampment was twelve @ITmil.@it Therefore, if not that they were startled backwards twelve @ITmil@it, those who stood at the front of the camp would still be within twelve @ITmil@it. If so, how could it say, “And stood far off”? (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it)<QC>
@p1[17]@p2<TIE>Because it is raised high.@p3 I.e., a banner is called @hh<HEB>נס@ee<ENG> because it is lifted up and raised high. Here, too, @hh<HEB>נסות@ee<ENG> means “so they will be lifted up.”<QC>
@p1[19]@p2<TIE>In this language.@p3 But here, [unlike 19:3,] Rashi does not explain it as, “In this order.” For here, the order does not matter.<QC>
@p1[21]@p2<TIE>Attached to the earth.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because otherwise, why is it called “earthen”? For it was made of copper-plated acacia wood, as it is written in 27:1. (@ITR. Noson@it) @p1@p2That are from your sheep and your cattle.@p3 Rashi added the words “That are” in order that the phrase, “Your sheep and your cattle,” will be an explanation of, “Your burnt-offerings, your peace-offerings.” And Rashi understands @hh<HEB>את@ee<ENG> in the sense of @hh<HEB>מן@ee<ENG> (from). Thus it is as if the verse said, “Slaughter your burnt-offerings and your peace-offerings @ITfrom@it your sheep and @ITfrom@it your cattle.” @p1@p2Wherever I will permit you.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 @hh<HEB>אזכיר@ee<ENG> is a transitive verb involving a secondary object, [conveying: @ITI@it permit @ITyou@it to mention @ITMy Name@it. Rashi knows this] because otherwise, it should say @hh<HEB>תזכור שמי@ee<ENG> (you mention My Name). Rashi explains “My Name” as “My special Name” — the Explicit Name — which was permitted to be uttered only in the Beis Hamikdosh, where the Shechinah resides. However, other Names of Hashem may be mentioned elsewhere.<QC>
@p1[22]@p2<TIE>You can derive from these things @BIa fortiori.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is saying: Should you ask, “What does the stone care if we bring anything that cuts and destroys upon it?” the answer is: so we will learn from it @ITa fortiori@it. The same applies to Rashi’s final comment on the next verse. @p1[23]@p2<TIE>Do not make it as a row of steps.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: [Why does the verse prohibit the @ITkohein@it to go up the steps?] If the altar was made with steps, the @ITkohein@it is compelled to use them to go up. And if the altar was not made with steps, there is no reason that he use them. Thus Rashi explains that the prohibition is on the @ITbuilder@it. When he @ITbuilds@it the altar, he should not make steps.<QC>
@p1[1]@p2<TIE>It disqualifies that which preceded it.@p3 If you say: [This rule seems not true because] in Parshas Bechukosai (Vayikra 27:34) it is written, “@hh<HEB>אלה@ee<ENG> (These) are the commandments.” And in Parshas Masei (Bamidbar 36:13) it says, “@hh<HEB>אלה@ee<ENG> (These) are the commandments and the laws.” And in Parshas Matos (ibid 30:17) it says, “@hh<HEB>אלה@ee<ENG> (These) are the statutes.” And in Parshas Ki Savo (Devarim 28:69) it is written, “@hh<HEB>אלה@ee<ENG> (These) are the words of the covenant.” And in all theses cases we do not interpret it as disqualifying that which preceded. The answer is: We only interpret it this way for “@hh<HEB>אלה@ee<ENG> (These) are the histories of the heaven and the earth” (Bereishis 2:4; see Shemos Rabba 30:3), where the histories were already mentioned above, so a difficulty arose: why are they repeated and detailed? Similarly for “@hh<HEB>אלה@ee<ENG> (These) are the descendants of Noach” (Bereishis 6:9), where the descendants were mentioned above in Parshas Bereishis, so a difficulty arose: why were they mentioned again? Thus we say they were mentioned again in order to disqualify the preceding. [The meaning of “disqualify” is discussed in the next entry.] But with “@hh<HEB>אלה@ee<ENG> (These) are the commandments” and all the above verses, nothing was mentioned [preceding them that was similar to them], so @hh<HEB>אלה@ee<ENG> cannot mean to disqualify the preceding. Similarly in Parshas Devarim, where it says “@hh<HEB>אלה@ee<ENG> (These) are the words” (Devarim 1:1), we cannot interpret @hh<HEB>אלה@ee<ENG> as disqualifying the preceding, since Chumash Devarim is @ITMishneh Torah@it [i.e., its primary purpose is a repetition of the Torah]. @d1Then why was the section of judgments placed near the section dealing with the Altar?@p3 Many difficulties arise. First, Rashi should have asked this [first, as his first comment] on the verse, “And these are the laws.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Second, perhaps [the Torah is just following] the order that these Torah sections were told by Hashem to Moshe. Third, Rashi explained straightforwardly at the beginning of Parshas Behar that the entire Torah was said by Hashem at Sinai. [So why does our verse connect only the judgments to Sinai?] Fourth, Rashi [earlier] should have said that the @hh<HEB>ו@ee<ENG> of @hh<HEB>ואלה@ee<ENG> “is a continuation of that which preceded it.” [I.e., why does Rashi need the whole word of @hh<HEB>ואלה@ee<ENG> to teach this?[ Fifth, Rashi should have explained this rule on the verse “@hh<HEB>אלה@ee<ENG> (These) are the products of the heaven and the earth” (Bereishis 2:4), or “@hh<HEB>אלה@ee<ENG> (These) are the descendants of Noach” (ibid 6:9). The answer is: The rule that @hh<HEB>אלה@ee<ENG> disqualifies (@hh<HEB>פסל@ee<ENG>) that which preceded it, means [that it @ITminimizes@it that which preceded it. I.e.,] these things now to be mentioned are better and more important than those preceding things which are less significant. That is the meaning of @hh<HEB>פסל@ee<ENG>. So did Bereishis Rabba explain “@hh<HEB>אלה@ee<ENG> (These) are the products of the heaven and the earth,” and “@hh<HEB>אלה@ee<ENG> (These) are the descendants of Noach.” Here too, if the Torah had written @hh<HEB>אלה@ee<ENG>, I would think it is disqualifying [i.e., minimizing] the judgments, [since it cannot be minimizing the preceding — the Ten Commandments — which were on the highest level]. But now that the Torah wrote @hb<HEB>ו@hhאלה@ee<ENG>, it means “a continuation of that which preceded it,” saying that the judgements, too, were given in the assembly of all B’nei Yisrael, with thunder and lightning, like the Ten Commandments that preceded them. Whereas the other mitzvos were given to Moshe alone, during his forty days on the mountain. Therefore Rashi asks: “Why was the section of judgments placed near the section dealing with the Altar?” Since the section of judgments is a continuation of the Ten Commandments, why does the section dealing with the Altar interrupt them? So explained the @ITRe’m@it at length. @d1Do not allow it to enter your mind to say, I will teach them.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because for most mitzvos the Torah says, “@ITSpeak@it to the B’nei Yisrael and @ITsay@it to them,” [or similar expressions]. Thus [the repetition of] “speak” and “say” implies teaching them at least twice. If so, why did Hashem now use the [unusual] expression of “set before them”? We must say it means “to make them understand the reasons for each thing.” (@ITRe’m@it) @d1And not before the gentiles.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because “before @ITthem@it” refers to the seventy elders mentioned above in Parshas Yisro, who ascended the mountain with Moshe before the giving of the Torah. This is Rashi’s approach, as stated in the first chapter of Maseches Gittin. Tosafos explained that “before @ITthem@it” refers to the judges mentioned in a future verse: “The claims of both parties must be brought to the @ITjudges@it” (22:8). But according to both views, it refers to expert judges and not laymen judges. Thus you might ask that “before them” could be teaching us: “and not before laymen judges,” and certainly not before the gentiles. The answer is: Rashi himself answered this question when he explained, “And even if you know of a particular law that they render the same as Jewish law, do not bring the matter to their courts.” Rashi is saying that the Torah excluded gentile judges absolutely, even if they rule the same as Jews. But [this exclusion could not apply to laymen judges,] since one is indeed allowed to have them judge if they know a particular law as well as the experts do. @p1[2]@p2<TIE>“If you buy.<TIE>.<TIE>.” A slave who is a Hebrew.@p3 Whereas if the verse was indeed referring to a gentile slave, it would have said: “When you buy a gentile slave from a Jew who sold him to you,” and it is not referring to a slave who was sold by a court for his theft. This is why Rashi first explains the meaning of @hh<HEB>עבד עברי@ee<ENG> before the words of @hh<HEB>כי תקנה@ee<ENG> that appear earlier, so that in this way, @hh<HEB>כי תקנה@ee<ENG> will prove that the verse is speaking of a [Hebrew] slave sold by the court. @d1But if bought from a Jew he shall go free after six years.@p3 And accordingly, piercing the slave’s ear [so he will serve until the yovel] would be a decree of the Torah rather than because of [what Rashi explained in v. 6]: “The ear, which heard upon Mount Sinai, ‘You shall not steal!’.<TIE>.<TIE>.” and “‘For @ITto Me@it are the B’nei Yisrael servants’.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @d1If your brother, the Hebrew, is sold to you.@p3 In other words, through a @ITgezeirah shavah@it we learn the meaning of @hh<HEB>עברי@ee<ENG> in this verse, from @hh<HEB>עברי@ee<ENG> (in Devarim 15:12), “Your brother, the Hebrew (@hh<HEB>העברי@ee<ENG>)<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.” For the word @hh<HEB>העברי@ee<ENG> there is superfluous — since it says “your brother”, [we know it is speaking of a Hebrew. So] why say also “the Hebrew”? Thus, @hh<HEB>עברי@ee<ENG> there is for a @ITgezeirah shavah,@it teaching that @hh<HEB>עברי@ee<ENG> here is “your brother”, [i.e., a Hebrew]. So explained the @ITRe’m.@it @p1[3]@p2<TIE>If he came by himself. The term @HB<HEB>בגפו@BO<ENG> is the same as @HB<HEB>בכנפו@BO<ENG>.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because the Targum translates the word @hh<HEB>כנף@ee<ENG> as @hh<HEB>גפא@ee<ENG>. @d1Wrapped in his garment, in the skirt of his garment.@p3 Since Rashi explained that @hh<HEB>בגפו@ee<ENG> means “the skirt of his garment,” which does not [directly] imply that he came single, thus Rashi explains that the verse indicates that he came with @ITnothing@it but his garment, [which is an expression used to describe someone who is single]. @d1This teaches that if he was unmarried.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows that this refers to a gentile handmaid] because otherwise, [if @hh<HEB>בגפו@ee<ENG> referred to his Jewish wife as in the beginning of the verse,] it should have said simply: @hh<HEB>בגפו יבא כן יצא@ee<ENG> (If he came by himself, so shall he go out.) Perforce, the second @hh<HEB>בגפו@ee<ENG> refers to a gentile handmaid, not to a Jewess. [And the first @hh<HEB>בגפו@ee<ENG> cannot refer to a gentile handmaid because it is written about a gentile handmaid (v. 4), “the woman and her children belong to her master,” whereas here it says, “his wife shall go out with him”]. Rashi uses the term @hh<HEB>מגיד@ee<ENG> (this teaches) because the law is only interpreted from the verse, and is not the verse’s simple meaning. @d1To a Jewish woman.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because it says afterwards, “His wife shall go out with him.” But if it is a gentile handmaiden, it says (v. 4), “The woman and her children belong to her master.” @ITRe’m@it based his explanation on the Mechilta, that “If he [was] married” relates back to @hh<HEB>בגפו יבא@ee<ENG>, i.e., his Jewish wife, rather than to the adjacent @hh<HEB>בגפו יצא@ee<ENG>, i.e., the gentile handmaiden. @d1He.<TIE>.<TIE>. becomes obligated to support his (the slave’s) wife and children.@p3 Although here the verse teaches only about supporting the wife, a later verse (Vayikra 25:41) says, “And he shall go out from you, he @ITand his sons@it.” But here Rashi mentions the support of children only in connection with the support of the wife (@ITRe’m@it), and it is speaking of children who are minors. In Maseches Kiddushin 22a it is explained why the Torah needs to mention that he is obligated to support both his wife and his children. @p1[4]@p2<TIE>From here.<TIE>.<TIE>. his master has the right.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 You might ask: Perhaps “his master should give him a wife” means giving him an adult Jewess who sold herself as a slave. [The verse stating that the Hebrew handmaid shall go free after six years refers only to a minor who was sold by her father. Thus it is possible to have an adult Jewess as a slave]? And a gentile handmaid would then be forbidden to a Hebrew slave, [as she is to other Jewish men,] for it is written: “There shall not be a male prostitute from the B’nei Yisrael” (Devarim 23:18). The answer is: Rashi holds that a woman may not sell herself as a slave, because it is written (Vayikra 25:39), “If your @ITbrother@it becomes impoverished and sells himself to you,” implying: your @ITbrother@it and not your @ITsister@it. @d1Or perhaps it is only a Jewish wife (that he may give him).@p3 You might ask: [Why think that the master may give his slave a Hebrew handmaid?] The master may designate a Hebrew handmaid only to himself or his son, and not to his slave [see verses 8 and 9]. The answer is: We might think that he may indeed give her to his slave, but not in marriage, only out of wedlock. And when it says (v. 8), “He has no power (right) to sell her.<TIE>.<TIE>.” we would say that this refers only to her father and not to her master. @d1[If] your Hebrew brother or sister.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 This refers back to what Rashi said before, “a Hebrew handmaid too goes free after six years.” @p1[5]@p2<TIE>The handmaid.@p3 [Rashi knows that] @hh<HEB>אשתי@hh@ee<ENG> must be referring to the gentile handmaid, since she remains with the master. In this way, the slave’s love of his master, wife and children is equal, in that he does not want to part with them. But this would not apply to a Jewish wife, [as she would go out with the slave].<QC>
@p1[6]@p2<TIE>@HB<HEB>אל האלהים@BO<ENG> means to court.@p3 The view holding that even the ear of a self-sold slave may be pierced would still agree that this verse of “bring him next to the door.<TIE>.<TIE>.” speaks of a slave sold by the court for his theft — since all agree that the verse “If you buy a Hebrew slave” speaks of a slave sold by the court for theft. Piercing a self-sold slave’s ear is learned from a @ITgezeirah shavah@it between the word @hh<HEB>שכיר@ee<ENG>, “hireling” (Devarim 15:18), and @hh<HEB>שכיר@ee<ENG> (Vayikra 25:50). The reason a self-sold slave’s ear is pierced is because [his ear heard Hashem say,] “For @ITto Me@it are the B’nei Yisrael servants.” (@ITRe’m@it)<QC>
@d1Till the Jubilee.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Because in the verse it is written @hb<HEB>ל@hhעולם@ee<ENG>, instead of simply @hh<HEB>עולם@ee<ENG>, [Rashi knew that] it means until the yovel. For Rashi already proved that @hh<HEB>עולם@ee<ENG> means yovel, thus] @hb<HEB>ל@hhעולם@ee<ENG> means until the yovel. Whereas @hh<HEB>עולם@ee<ENG> would mean an entire 50 years.<QC>
@p1[7]@p2<TIE>Comparing the Hebrew woman to the Hebrew man.<TIE>.<TIE>. attaining their freedom.@p3 This teaches that she goes out even at the yovel, because going out after six years is written expressly in the verse of “If there should be sold to you your Hebrew brother or @ITyour Hebrew sister@it.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @d1Thereby comparing the Hebrew man to the Hebrew woman:@p3 You might ask: Since the Hebrew man is compared to the Hebrew woman, should he not too, go free upon showing signs of puberty? The answer is: There is no case of a male Hebrew slave showing signs of puberty, [since he is always an adult before he is sold]. For a minor cannot sell himself, as a minor’s transactions have no validity. And the court cannot sell a minor for his theft, since a minor is not subject to punishment. And a father cannot sell his son, because it is written in our verse, “If a man sells his @ITdaughter@it to be a maidservant,” thus excluding the sale of his son. All this is explained by the @ITRe’m@it.<QC>
@p1[8]@p2<TIE>Here the Torah implies that it is a @BImitzvah@BO for him to marry her.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because it says, “If she is displeasing to her master,” providing the reason why he did not marry her. Thus we infer that if she is not displeasing, he should marry her. Since the Torah calls her marriage @hh<HEB>יעוד@ee<ENG> (designation), rather than saying: “had not @ITmarried@it her,” we learn that she requires no other marriage ritual. @d1For he, too, must aid in her redemption.@p3 Since it does not say @hh<HEB>ונפדת@ee<ENG> (she shall be redeemed), rather @hh<HEB>והפדה@ee<ENG> (lit. he shall make her redeemed), we learn that the master must aid in her redemption by calculating for her [the years she already served]. @d1Neither the master nor the father.@p3 Since it says that the master should designate her to himself, or to his son, why would we think he could sell her? Therefore, we must say that “He has no power to sell her” means that even the @ITfather@it may not sell her. @p1[9]@p2<TIE>[“He” refers to] the master.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because [after selling her,] the father may not give her to another, [thus the verse must refer to the master]. And Rashi had to state “the master” expressly, so we would not mistakenly say the following: just as neither the master nor the father may sell her [see Rashi on the previous verse], so too, neither of them may designate her to the master’s son. Therefore Rashi expressly states that the master may do so. His proof is from v. 11 which says, “If he does none of these three things to her, she goes out free.” And two of these three things (deducting from her price and designation to the master) [see Rashi on v. 11], are done by the master. [Thus the third — designating to a son — is also done by the master.] (@ITRe’m@it)  @d1And he will not require another marriage ritual.@p3 Meaning that [the son is] just like his father, who does not need another marriage ritual since her purchase money effects the marriage. For if this were not so, the verse should have said: If he has @ITmarried@it or @ITtaken@it her for his son, [rather than: “he has @ITdesignated@it her”]. @d1Food, clothing, and marital relations.@p3 Meaning that she has the same marital rights as all other @ITbnos Yisrael@it, in regard to food, clothing and marital relations. Although a husband’s general obligation in these matters is not stated anywhere in the Torah, [as the following verse mentions them only in connection to the Hebrew maidservant], our verse teaches [that these obligations apply to the Jewish maidservant], and consequently [we] learn [that these marital rights apply to all @ITbnos Yisrael@it as well]. @ITMechilta@it @p1[10]@p2<TIE>Whom he had already designated as his wife.@p3 Rashi is saying that “not diminish” implies not taking away from what she already had, as it is written in v. 9, “He must grant her exactly the same rights as daughters,” which is speaking before he took a second wife. (@ITRe’m@it) @p1[11]@p2<TIE>If he does none of these three things.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because if the verse meant doing all three, why does it say, “She goes out free with no repayment of money?” If he designated her as a wife to himself or his son, she needs a divorce document [rather than going out freely]. And if he deducted from her redemption price, she must pay the rest [rather than going out without money]. Alternatively, [Rashi knows this] because doing all three is impossible: it would entail designating her to both himself and his son. (@ITRe’m@it) @d1What are the three things.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because if the three were sustenance, clothing and conjugal rights, she would not go out freely. She would need a divorce document, since he designated her as a wife.<QC>
@d1Until she demonstrates signs (of puberty).@p3 [Rashi is explaining that] she does not go out immediately upon his failure to do one of these three things. @p1[12]@p2<TIE>Which does not cause death.@p3 The @ITRe’m@it asks: How could [Rashi suggest that] he might be put to death for a blow which does not cause death? [On the contrary,] it is written (v. 19) that if the victim does not die, the law is: “the one who struck him be acquitted, still he must pay for his loss of work, and must pay for his complete cure.” The @ITRe’m@it left this unanswered. An answer is: We would think it is like striking one’s father or mother, for which one is put to death for striking them, even without killing them. And the difference would be that for parents, one is liable even without making a wound, but for others, only with a wound. Although it is written (v. 25): “a wound for a wound,” [teaching that for making a wound, one pays damages but is not put to death], and Rashi explains there: “A wound that draws blood,” [thus we see that for making even a significant wound, one is @ITnot@it liable for death]. But [we could explain that] that verse applies only if one struck unintentionally. Whereas if intentionally, one would be liable for the death penalty. And when it is written (v. 13): “But Hashem brought it to his hand,” teaching that for striking unintentionally, he is liable for exile [but not for paying damages], this applies when he had intent to strike one person but in fact struck another. Whereas without any intent to strike, he is not liable for exile [and must pay damages]. And when it says (v. 18—19) that if the victim “does not die”, [thus one pays damages], we could say that this applies to striking in a way that cannot kill, i.e., there was no wound at all. (@ITKitzur Mizrachi@it) Another answer is: We would think that if he does not agree to pay damages [for striking without killing], then he is put to death — as it is said in Maseches Sanhedrin (15b) concerning @ITkofer@it [the atonement fine for when one’s ox kills a man]. And this answers all @ITRe’m@it’s questions. @d1Even were a minor to strike a blow and kill he would be liable.@p3 The @ITRe’m@it asks: [Why does Rashi say that a minor might be liable?] Where do we ever find the Torah punishing a minor? The Gemara (Sanhedrin 68b) raises a similar question concerning the @ITben sorer umoreh,@it and answers: “Did you think that a @ITben sorer umoreh@it is killed for his sin? He is killed only because of what he will do in the end!” There, the Gemara says that even a minor might be liable. But here, how could we say such a thing? The @ITNachalas Yaakov@it answers: Since it is written, “If @ITone@it strikes a man,” [implying any striker at all,] we might think it includes that even a minor is subject to the death penalty, although generally a minor is exempt from all mitzvos. Therefore we need “And if a @ITman@it strikes,” to exclude a minor. This question and its answer are relevant to all the cases following as well. @d1Even a baby that cannot live would be included.@p3 The @ITRe’m@it says that this interpretation [saying that one is liable for killing a viable child] was received by @ITChazal@it as an oral tradition. Otherwise, we could say that “If one strikes a @ITman@it” exempts killing a minor, and “any human being” makes one liable for killing an [adult who is a] woman, one whose gender is indistinguishable, or a hermaphrodite. The same applies to @ITChazal@it’s interpretation that the verse “If a man should strike” (Vayikra 24:17) makes one liable only for a blow that kills. Otherwise we could expound the opposite: since it says in our verse, “If one strikes a man and he dies,” this means only for a blow that kills. Therefore the verse in Vayikra says, “If a man should strike,” teaching that even for a blow that does not cause death, [still he would be liable]. The @ITRe’m@it explained at length. However, it is difficult [how can Rashi suggest that one might be liable for the death penalty for killing even a baby that cannot live]. If so, when would one be liable merely to pay damages for killing a fetus [see v. 22]? An answer is: damages would apply when one had no intent to injure the fetus. This is similar to what Rebbi said (Sanhedrin 79a), that “A life for a life” (v. 23) means merely to pay money [when the striker intended to kill a certain person but actually killed another). Another answer is: One would be subject to the death penalty for killing an unviable baby that was already born, whereas before its birth, one would not be liable [to the death penalty, only to pay damages]. (Tosafos, Sanhedrin 84b) @p1[13]@p2<TIE>Like its Targum, “And he did not ambush him.”@p3 Since the Targum translates @hh<HEB>וארב לו@ee<ENG> (Devarim 19:11) as: @hh<HEB>וכמן ליה@ee<ENG> , and the Targum translated the same on our verse, which says @hh<HEB>צדה@ee<ENG>, this proves that our verse, too, means: “He did not ambush him.”<QC>
@d1And falls upon the one.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 This means he already went up, and is falling upon the one below as he is going down the ladder  — and not as he is going up, since in such a case he would not be exiled (Makkos 7b). Rashi here mentioned going up the ladder only because he could not fall while going down unless he first went up. (@ITRe’m@it) @d1The one who killed accidentally is exiled.@p3 You might ask: But he still is not being punished for his @ITfirst@it accidental killing? The answer is: he killed someone who was already considered “dead,” [as the person he fell upon was liable for death]. And it is known before Hashem that he need not be exiled for this [second accidental killing], only we do not know this. [Thus, the court rules that he must be exiled — ostensibly for the second killing, but Hashem knows that it is for the first.] @d1And the one who killed with premeditation is killed.@p3 We must say that he had a sword in his hand when he fell and killed him. Otherwise, the premeditated murderer would not be killed by the sword, which is the type of death for which he is liable as he is liable for. For if the person simply fell on him, it is like [death by] stoning. @d1It was the camp of the Levites.@p3 Since [Hashem speaks to Moshe in this verse and says:] “I will designate for @ITyou@it a place,” it means that the place will be in @ITyour@it camp. And Moshe was a Levite. Thus, the place designated is in the wilderness, and in the Levite camp. For in the wilderness, Moshe’s camp gave refuge.<QC>
@p1[14]@p2<TIE>The Torah therefore says: “If he plots.”@p3 You might ask: Since liability for the death penalty requires testimony and prior warning, how could killing accidentally ever be liable for the death penalty? And perforce, an accident was not prewarned. For if it was, it would not be accidental! The answer is: We are dealing with [a killer who is] a learned person and needs no warning [since he surely knows the punishment — were he to act intentionally]. You might ask: Why do we need our verse to exclude an unintentional killer [from the death penalty]? It is written (v. 13) that when “he did not lie in wait,” the punishment is exile, not death. (@ITRe’m@it) The answer is: We are dealing with an unintentional killing that was close to being intentional. For example, he intended to kill one person and killed another. In such a case, exile does not atone for him, since he acted negligently, [therefore we need this verse to exclude this case from the death penalty]. @en@p1[15]@p2<TIE>Which causes a wound.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because it says (Vayikra 24:21): “Whoever smites an animal shall pay for it, and whoever smites a man shall be put to death.” [This implies a comparison between the two:] just as smiting an animal [is liable only] when there is a wound [as otherwise there is no damage to the animal], so too with smiting a man, [one is liable only] when he inflicts a wound. @d1Either one or the other.@p3 It is written @hb<HEB>ו@hhאמו@ee<ENG>, and a @ITvav@it usually means to add to what preceded [and thus would be translated as “and”]. Nevertheless, Rashi explains that a @ITvav@it can also denote one of the two, [and thus would be translated as “or”], unless the verse specifically states that the two are to be considered “together” (@hh<HEB>יחדו@ee<ENG>). So it is with the verse, “You may not plow with an ox and a donkey (@hb<HEB>ו@hhבחמור@ee<ENG>) @ITtogether@it” (Devarim 22:10). There, the verse needed to state “together” [in order for the @ITvav@it to mean “and”]. @en@p1[16]@p2<TIE>Who stole another person.@p3 The @ITRe’m@it was puzzled by Rashi’s comment. For when it said (v. 12): “If one strikes a man,” Rashi did not expound the verse along the same lines as he did here. He should have said there: “Since it is said: ‘If a man strikes’ (Vayikra 24:17), I would know only [that this applies to] a man who struck. But a woman, or one whose gender is indistinguishable, or a hermaphrodite [who struck], how would we know [that this law applies]? Therefore the Torah says: ‘If @ITone@it strikes a man.’” The @ITRe’m@it on v. 12 explained Rashi’s exegesis there by saying that perhaps the interpretation was received by @ITChazal@it as an oral tradition. Another answer, which the @ITRe’m@it offers, is that perhaps the Tanna there was not trying to explain all the laws that those verses teach us. He intended only to explain the seemingly extra verses. Thus he merely stated some of the laws, thereby showing the need for both verses: what this verse lacks, the other verse teaches.<QC>
@p2And he was already in his (the thief’s) possession before he sold him.@p3 Rashi is excluding the case where the thief first sold him and only then stole him [i.e., took him out of his home]. Thus, the law of kidnapping resembles the law of other property theft — where the thief is exempt [from the law of paying four or five times the stolen animal’s value] if he slaughtered or sold the animal before removing it from the owner’s premises. And this is how the Ramban understands Rashi’s words on the Gemara (Sanhedrin 95b). (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @d1Wherever the Torah mentions an unspecified death.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 But above (v. 15), Rashi did not need to explain this. This is because the verse of “Whoever steals a man and sells him” interrupts between the verse of striking one’s father (v. 15) and that of cursing him (v. 17). And had it not interrupted, we would say that [the punishment for] striking is learned from [the punishment for] cursing. As Rashi explains, one who curses his father is stoned. Thus, one who strikes him would also be stoned. Therefore the Torah interrupts with “Whoever steals a man” [in order to teach us:] just as one who kidnaps is strangled, so too, is one who strikes his father strangled. And if you would ask: How do we know that one who kidnaps is strangled? The answer is as Rashi explains here: “Wherever the Torah mentions an unspecified death.<TIE>.<TIE>.” I found this [written]. @p1[18]@p2<TIE>But the loss of work and medical costs.@p3 Rashi mentions [only] loss of work and medical costs, because [compensation for] pain and embarrassment are learned from other Torah sections. (@ITRe’m@it) @p1[19]@p2<TIE> On his health and his strength.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because if the meaning of @hh<HEB>משענתו@ee<ENG> was literal, “his staff,” the person [walking on his staff] could still be ill and might still die. If so, why does it say, “The one who struck him shall be acquitted”?<QC>
@d1He must pay the doctor’s fee.@p3 [He must pay in all cases because] even if he is a doctor, the victim may claim: “I do not want you to heal me, because to me, you are like a devouring lion!” And if the striker says, “I know a doctor who will heal you for free,” the victim may claim, “A doctor who heals for nothing is worth nothing.” @p1[20]@p2<TIE>Included in: “Whoever strikes a man who dies.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi asks this] because even a gentile is included [in the term @hh<HEB>איש@ee<ENG> (man), in the verse: “Whoever strikes a @ITman@it who dies shall be put to death.”] And certainly a gentile slave, who is obligated to keep mitzvos, [is included]. For a gentile is only excluded when the Torah writes @hh<HEB>רעהו@ee<ENG> (his friend). @d1By the rule of “a day or two.”@p3 You might ask: Why did Rashi not ask his question on the verse [immediately, rather than first proving that it speaks of a gentile slave]? The answer is, so we will not say: Since the Torah taught the special law of “a day or two” concerning a gentile slave, it will apply also to a Jewish slave, in accordance with the rule of @ITdavar shehaya bichlal.<TIE>.<TIE>.@it [which allows this special law to apply to everything in the category of slaves]. Therefore Rashi first proves that the verse is talking @ITonly@it about a gentile slave. And Rashi is saying, so to speak: “Now [the rule of ‘a day or two’] will come out clear, [since we have established that the verse is not speaking of a Hebrew slave].” @d1And upon a limb which is capable of causing death.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because [regarding a Yisraelite victim] it says (Devarim 19:11): “And he will ambush him, arising against him.” This means that he has intent to kill him. But if the rock [or the stricken limb] was not capable of causing death, perforce he had no intent to kill him. You might ask: [If this law can be learned from a Yisraelite victim,] why does the Torah need to write in this verse, “With a rod”? The answer is: @ITa fortiori@it reasoning [“it follows even more so.<TIE>.<TIE>.”] is not a valid basis for applying a punishment.<QC>
@p1[21]@p2<TIE>Even were he to linger for 24 hours.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Why did the verse not simply say, “His slave, who is his property”? Why does it instead say, “@ITFor@it he is his property”? Thus Rashi explains that this phrase is providing a reason for the above law, saying: only the master is subject to the law of “a day or two,” [since the slave is his property], but another person does not. @p1[22]@p2<TIE>If men will fight — with one another.@p3 As opposed to both of them fighting with the woman. For if that was the case, even one man [would be sufficient]. Furthermore, it would say [at the end of our verse], “@ITThey@it shall pay.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @d1To the woman.@p3 It could not refer to the fetus, because the next verse says: “However if there @ITis@it a fatal injury, you shall give a life for a life.” And if it referred to the fetus, [this law would not apply], because it says [in v. 12 that one is liable only] “if one strikes a @ITman@it,” as opposed to striking a fetus that cannot live.<QC>
@d1They shall impose monetary compensation on him.@p3 Since it says afterwards, “He shall pay as determined by the judges,” implying that he did not paid yet, Rashi therefore says: “they shall impose,” rather than “he pays.” @d1When the husband summons him to the court.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because if it meant he pays the amount that the husband demands, what is the meaning of “He shall pay as determined by the judges”? @d1The one who struck.<TIE>.<TIE>. the value of the offspring.@p3 [Rashi is explaining:] as opposed to paying the value of the stricken woman. And this is a “short” verse [because it says “he shall pay” without saying @ITwhat@it he pays].<QC>
@p1[26]@p2<TIE>She shall not go free as do the (gentile) male-slaves.@p3 [Also a @ITmale@it Hebrew slave does not go free in this manner, since male and female Hebrew slaves] are compared to one another by the Torah, as it says, “If your Hebrew @ITbrother or sister@it is sold to you.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (Devarim 15:12). @p1@p2<TIE>Twenty-four tips of limbs.@p3 This is derived from the law of tooth and eye, which serves as a @ITbinyan av@it (prototype). The common denominator [of tooth and eye] is that they are: permanent defects, tips of limbs, visible, and the result of an intentional blow. Thus, all [the other 24 tips of limbs, which have these qualities, have the same law]. This excludes the case of the master cutting flesh from his slave, since it grows back. (@ITMechilta@it)<QC>
@p1[28]@p2<TIE>And a beast or bird.@p3 This is learned from a @ITgezeirah shavah@it between the word @hh<HEB>שור@ee<ENG> (ox) in our verse, and the word @hh<HEB>שור@ee<ENG> in the section of Shabbos (Shemos 23:12) — as Rashi explains [below] on the verse of “an ox or a donkey” (v. 33). @p1[29]@p2<TIE>Making.<TIE>.<TIE>. three gorings.@p3 [They are:] the goring of yesterday, of the day before, and of today. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) This teaches that he is not liable until the fourth goring. @d1Kill him with biting.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because “and it kills” is a superfluous phrase. For it already said (v. 28), “If an ox gores a man.<TIE>.<TIE>. and he dies,” and immediately afterwards the verse states, “But if the ox had gored.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Thus, the superfluous “and it kills” comes to include any method of killing that is similar to [goring with] the horn. (@ITKitzur Mizrachi@it) The reason why Rashi did not mention the method of crouching [on the victim, although the Gemara mentions it] is because Rashi included it in “shoving.” @p1[30]@p2<TIE>The word @HB<HEB>אם@BO<ENG> here.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 You might ask: At the end of Parshas Yisro, Rashi cited R. Yishmael’s statement that there are three cases of @hh<HEB>אם@ee<ENG> in the Torah that are not conditional. This was on the verse, “@hh<HEB>אם@ee<ENG> (When) you build a stone Altar for Me.” And this verse, “@hh<HEB>אם@ee<ENG> (When) an atonement fine.<TIE>.<TIE>.” is not included among them. The answer is: Although this verse, too, is not conditional in the sense that it is indeed obligatory, [like the three cases of R. Yishmael], nevertheless, it is conditional in the sense that it depends on an external factor — if an ox gores someone and kills him, only then is one liable for an atonement fine. But if not, one is not liable. Therefore it was omitted. (@ITRe’m@it) @en@p1[31]@p2<TIE>He is liable for a minor.@p3 You might ask: If this is so, why did it need to say (v. 28): “a man or a woman”? [Since he is liable for a minor, surely he is liable for an adult!] An answer is: Had it not said “a man or a woman,” I might think that the “son or daughter” of our verse means an @ITadult@it son or daughter. Alternatively, [I might have applied the rule that] @ITa fortiori@it reasoning is not a valid basis for a punishment, [thus we cannot learn from a law pertaining to minors and apply it to adults].<QC>
@en@p1[32]@p2<TIE>Gentile [slaves].@p3 [Rashi knows this] because it is written, “He must give thirty silver @ITshekalim@it” — whereas if it was speaking of a Hebrew slave, he would have to pay the atonement fine [see v. 30]. @d1This is a decree of the Torah.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 It seems that Rashi is answering [a question that could arise] about what he said earlier, that “male or female slave” refers to a gentile slave. [For one could ask:] perhaps in truth it is referring to a Hebrew slave? And even though their law is the atonement fine, this verse is [not contradicting this law, but] adding a stringency onto the owner of the goring ox: if the atonement fine is greater than the 30 shekalim, he must pay the atonement fine. And if it is less, he must pay the 30 shekalim. Therefore Rashi explains that the 30 shekalim is a decree of the Torah [and applies absolutely] — so we cannot make the above distinctions regarding the 30 shekalim, [calculating which way the payment is higher], and apply these distinctions to the Hebrew slave. @p1[33]@p2<TIE>One who digs.<TIE>.<TIE>. after another has dug.<TIE>.<TIE>. is liable.@p3 Rashi means that if the first man dug nine @ITtefachim@it and the second man completed it to ten @ITtefachim,@it the second is [fully] liable whether the ox died or was damaged. For by completing the pit to ten @ITtefachim,@it it can now both kill and damage [whereas before it could only damage]. And the first man is fully exempt, even if the ox is damaged. For no verse is needed to exempt him if the ox died, since he did not make it deep enough to kill, and clearly he is exempt — [perforce, the verse comes to exempt him even if the ox is only damaged]. @d1But if he covers it, he is not liable.@p3 Rashi means: Do not think that covering it is insufficient and he needs to fill it up with earth, so the verse tells us [this is not so]. @d1Of digging in the public domain.@p3 Because if he dug in the [damager’s] private domain, the damager could tell the damaged party, “What was your ox doing in my domain?” The law [of this verse] applies as well to any place where the damager cannot say, “What is your ox doing in my domain?” Rashi is only excluding digging a pit in the [damager’s] private domain (Bava Kama 49b). @d1We derive it “@HB<HEB>שור@BO<ENG>, @HB<HEB>שור@BO<ENG>” regarding Shabbos.@p3 The @ITRe’m@it was puzzled [why we need the @ITgezeirah shavah@it], The Gemara (Bava Kama 54b) mentions the verse, “He must compensate its @ITowner@it with money” (v. 34), and applies it to a damaging pit, teaching that [payment must be made for] anything with an owner, [not just for animals and beasts. If so, what does the @ITgezeirah shavah@it of this verse teach us?] The @ITRe’m@it answers: we need “compensate its @ITowner@it with money,” [and we need this verse as well]. Because without “compensate its @ITowner@it with money,” we would interpret this verse as follows: @hh<HEB>ונפל שמה@ee<ENG> is a @ITklal@it (general rule), and @hh<HEB>שור או חמור@ee<ENG> is a @ITprat@it (specific case). Consequently, the @ITklal@it includes only what is in the @ITprat@it — an ox and donkey, and nothing else. And the @ITgezeirah shavah@it is not strong enough to nullify the @ITklal@it and @ITprat.@it Therefore, “compensate its @ITowner@it with money” comes to teach us [that payment must be made for] anything with an owner — and this nullifies the @ITklal@it and @ITprat.@it But if so, why do we need the @ITgezeirah shavah@it of “@hh<HEB>שור@ee<ENG>, @hh<HEB>שור@ee<ENG>” regarding Shabbos, [i.e., the original question arises again]? The verse could have simply said, @hh<HEB>ונפל שמה הנופל@ee<ENG> (And something fell into it). Why does it say@hh<HEB>שור או חמור@ee<ENG>, [from which the @ITgezeirah shavah@it is derived]? The answer is: [In truth, the @ITgezeirah shavah@it is not needed. And that is why Rashi goes on to say that from @hh<HEB>שור או חמור@ee<ENG> we infer,] “An ‘ox,’ but not a man. A ‘donkey,’ but not vessels.” @d1“An ox,” but not a man.@p3 This is a decree of the Torah [and thus applies absolutely.] It makes no difference whether or not the man was intelligent or not, and [it applies] even at night and even if he was blind. [I.e., the exemption from payment applies even in cases where the man who fell in could not be faulted.] @d1A “donkey,” but not vessels.@p3 Meaning: [The case is not that a man pushed the vessels into the pit, rather] that a donkey with vessels fell into the pit, and the [donkey was injured and the] vessels were damaged. And [the verse teaches that] the digger is liable for the animal but exempt for the vessels. @d1The injured party’s.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because if [@hh<HEB>לו@ee<ENG> refers] to the owner of the pit, the Torah should simply write, “The owner of the pit must pay” — and then the Torah does not have to say, “And the dead [animal] remains his.” [For we would know that he receives the carcass, since he is paying for the full value of the animal.] Perforce, [@hh<HEB>לו@ee<ENG> refers] to the injured party.<QC>
@p1[35]@p2<TIE> The ox of a man.@p3 This is the meaning as opposed to [saying that @hh<HEB>וכי יגף שור איש@ee<ENG>] means, “If an ox gores a man.” [It cannot mean that,] because afterwards it is written, “his neighbor’s ox.”<QC>
@p1[36]@p2<TIE>Or it was not a @HB<HEB>תם@BO<ENG>.@p3 Rashi does not explain@hh<HEB>או@ee<ENG> (or) as meaning @hh<HEB>אם@ee<ENG> (if), because then it would be written with an adjunctive @ITvav,@it as @hb<HEB>ו@hhאם@ee<ENG> (and if). This resolves the @ITRe’m@it’s question: why does Rashi not explain the verse as “if”, as Rashi did on the verse, “If (@hh<HEB>או@ee<ENG>) his sin becomes known to him” (Vayikra 3:23)? [The @ITRe’m@it claimed] that “if” would have explained the verse very well, and Rashi would not have had to insert the word “@hh<HEB>אלא@ee<ENG>,” [in order to give meaning to the verse]. The @ITRe’m@it left the matter unresolved. The @ITRe’m@it also objects: Rashi himself, on the verse of “If (@hh<HEB>או@ee<ENG>) his sin becomes known to him,” explains that @hh<HEB>או@ee<ENG> is like @hh<HEB>אם@ee<ENG>, as in: “If (@hh<HEB>או@ee<ENG>) it was known that it was a goring ox.” This contradicts what Rashi says here! This matter is unresolved.<QC>
@d1To the damaged party.@p3 You might object: Rashi already explained this above (v. 34). An answer is: This verse is the primary source for the law that the owner has to look after the carcass, [thus Rashi mentioned it again here]. An alternative answer is: Since [this law is stricter than that of the @hh<HEB>תם@ee<ENG>, and] the damager pays in full, we might mistakenly think that he must also look after the carcass. Therefore Rashi explained that the carcass belongs to the damaged party. @p1[37]@p2<TIE>The Torah repeats them.@p3 Meaning: if the Torah did not repeat them, we would make a @ITgezeirah shavah@it between @hh<HEB>שור@ee<ENG> here and @hh<HEB>שור@ee<ENG> in the section of Shabbos (Shemos 23:12), and learn that the law of paying “four or five” applies even to stealing any beast or bird. When Rashi says, “The Torah repeats them,” it means as follows: The Gemara (Bava Kama 67b) explains that the verse could have said, “If a man steals an @ITox@it and then slaughters or sells it, he must pay five oxen for it, and four sheep for each @ITsheep@it.” Why repeat “ox” at the beginning and “sheep” at the end? [See Gemara for full explanation.] It is to tell us: [for stealing] an ox or sheep, yes, [he pays four or five]. But for other things, he does not. @p1[1]@p2<TIE>He was actually in the act of breaking in.@p3 This is as opposed to explaining: the thief was found in the @ITplace@it of breaking in. [That cannot be the meaning,] because “breaking in” is not a place, about which we could say that the thief was “found” there. Therefore, Rashi explains that he was found “in the act” of breaking in. @p1[2]@p2<TIE>If the issue is clear to you.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 That is, if reason dictates that his intentions are peaceful. For example, a father who is breaking in to steal money from the son. But if reason dictates that he has intention of killing, since he knows that a man does not remain silent while seeing his property being taken — then you should kill him first. (@ITRe’m@it) @d1That his intentions.<TIE>.<TIE>. are peaceful — just as this sun.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 The @ITRe’m@it was puzzled why Rashi cited the Mechilta, [which says that the sun is an allegory for peace,] and ignored the Baraisa in Sanhedrin 72a, which says: “If it as @ITclear to you as the sun@it that his intentions towards you are peaceful.<TIE>.<TIE>.” For according to the Baraisa, the sun is an allegory for the issue being clear, not for peace. [To resolve this,] it seems that Rashi was answering a question: [If the simple meaning of the verse is as the Baraisa said,] why does the verse not say, “If it shines on him like day,” or simply “day,” as in, “Sell, @ITas the day@it, your birthright to me” (Bereishis 25:31)? This would have meant that the issue is clear. Therefore Rashi explains [the verse according to the Mechilta:] “Just as the sun represents peace.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Yet you might object: Why does Rashi cite the Mechilta, [which does not follow the plain meaning of the verse either]? The answer is: The Mechilta is close to the verse’s plain meaning, and also resolves various difficulties in the verses. @d1The @BIthief.@p3 Rashi added the word “thief” so we will not say that the @IThouse-owner@it pays the heirs, [if he killed the thief. I.e.,] that the house-owner would not receive the death penalty even though “there is liability for the thief’s blood,” but would instead pay an atonement fine to the thief’s heirs. This cannot be [the verse’s meaning] because it is written afterwards, “If he does not have [the means to do so], he shall be sold for his theft.” Thus we see that the verse is speaking of the @ITthief@it.<QC>
@p1[3]@p2<TIE>In his possession, for he had not slaughtered it.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi mentioned slaughtering] because it said earlier (21:37): “And then slaughters or sells it.” Thus Rashi writes here, “He had @ITnot@it slaughtered it nor sold it.” But Rashi does not really mean to say only slaughtering. [For if the thief slaughtered it, it would still be “in his possession”]. @d1Pay two-fold to his fellow man.@p3 [A difficulty arises:] The other verse, [“for a sheep, a garment.<TIE>.<TIE>.”] is speaking of [a different case: that of a watchman] who [falsely] claims that a thief [stole what he was guarding — and when disproved, he must pay two-fold.] But this verse is speaking of the thief [himself. So how can Rashi compare them?] The answer is: Since the Torah gave them the same law regarding two-fold restitution, surely they are the same as regards paying two-fold for everything, whether animate or not. @p1[4]@p2<TIE> Either by sending in his cattle.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is saying that there are two types of damages here: one is “sending in,” which is damage caused by trampling of the @hh<HEB>רגל@ee<ENG> (foot). And the other is “feeding,” which is damage of the @hh<HEB>שן@ee<ENG> (tooth). The verse does not mean that he sent the animal into a vineyard and it went and ate, which would be only the damage of @hh<HEB>שן@ee<ENG>. @d1In another man’s field.@p3 Rashi added the word “man’s”, [and did not explain @hh<HEB>שדה אחר@ee<ENG> as “another field”,] because @hh<HEB>שדה@ee<ENG> is feminine, whereas @hh<HEB>אחר@ee<ENG> is masculine. [Therefore, @hh<HEB>אחר@ee<ENG> cannot be the adjective of @hh<HEB>שדה@ee<ENG>.] (@ITMaharshal@it) @d1We evaluate the damage.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi is saying] that the damager does not give him @ITall@it of his best fields even if they are worth more than the damages. He cannot give him whichever field he wishes, [i.e., pick an inferior field to pay from]. Also, that he is not required to pay specifically from prime fields as opposed to paying money. @d1He must pay him from the best of his fields.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 If he chooses to pay from moveable possessions, he may pay even from bran [i.e., items of the lowest quality]. For with moveable possessions, everything is considered the best [because one can take it from place to place and find a buyer for it]. @p1[5]@p2<TIE>Even by itself.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because it does not say @hh<HEB>יבעיר@ee<ENG> (he made it burn) as it is written in the preceding verse, “If he damages a field.<TIE>.<TIE>. with his animal (@hh<HEB>כי יבער@ee<ENG>).” It is written here “@hh<HEB>המבעיר את הבערה@ee<ENG> (The one @ITwho started@it the fire).” @p1[6]@p2<TIE> According to his own testimony.@p3 Rashi, [in explaining that the theft is not an established fact,] is answering the question: But it says afterwards (v. 7), “He must come before the judges [to swear]” — [and why should he swear, if we already know?] Furthermore, how could @ITChazal@it say that “If the thief is not found,” it means that the watchman stole it himself? Yet here it says, “And they are stolen,” apparently meaning that they were surely stolen. [Therefore Rashi explains that this is not an established fact; rather it is the watchman’s claim.]<QC>
@p1[8]@p2<TIE>Unless he made a partial admission.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because “Of which [a witness] says, ‘This is it!’” implies that the watchman had previously said to the owner: I owe you only this [part, not more]. @p1[9]@p2<TIE>The first section deals with a @HB<HEB>שומר חנם@BO<ENG>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi means that we cannot say it is the opposit way, as reason dictates that it is this way, [since in the first section he is @ITnot@it held responsible for theft].<QC>
@p1[10]@p2<TIE>He is liable for those accidents.@p3 Why must he take an oath that he did not lay his hand on it, in order to be exempt for accidents? Because it deals with a @hh<HEB>שומר שכר@ee<ENG>, whose oath comes to support his claim that he is exempt from payment since an accident happened. Yet, when is he exempt when accidents occur? [Only] if he did not lay his hand on it [i.e., he did not make personal use of it]. @d1 [The watchman need not make restitution] to him at all.@p3 [Rashi explains this, so] we do not think that he is exempt from the double restitution mentioned above, yet he must still pay for the item itself. Therefore Rashi explains that he is exempt from making any restitution to him at all.<QC>
@p1[12]@p2<TIE> He shall bring [two] witnesses.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 There are those who ask: Why are two witnesses needed? One witness [supporting his claim] would exempt him from the oath, and consequently he would also be exempt from having to pay. The answer is: Rashi holds that a single supporting witness does not exempt [from an oath. Rather, a single @ITopposing@it witness makes one @ITliable@it for an oath]. Therefore he needs two witnesses. (See @ITChoshen Mishpat@it ch. 87) @d1But who whispered to you to come to these conclusions?@p3 The @ITRe’m@it explains: But who whispered to you to differentiate between torn apart by a lion and torn apart by a cat, when the Torah only writes a general phrase: “If it was torn apart”? True, it is written @hb<HEB>ה@hhטריפה@ee<ENG> with a @hh<HEB>ה@ee<ENG>, implying that a distinction is to be made. Nevertheless, from this we cannot know what sort of tearing apart makes one liable and what sort of tearing apart causes one to be exempt. Therefore we need the @IThekeish@it [that Rashi mentions]. @p1[13]@p2<TIE>Employed by the borrower to do his work.@p3 Rashi adds the phrase “employed by the borrower to do his work” so we will not think that when the verse says “with him,” it means that they are physically together in a certain place. Therefore Rashi explains it as “to do his work.” [Consequently, the verse is saying that the law is the same] whether the borrower and owner are doing the work in different places or in the same place, or even if the owner is with the borrower but in a different work [not connected to the ox. We know this last case] because the [next] verse says, “If the owner is with him,” implying any work done with him [see Rashi there]. @p1[14]@p2<TIE> At the time of the injury or the death.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because it says [in the previous verse]: “If a man borrows something from his neighbor, @ITand@it it becomes broken or dies; if the owner is @ITnot with him@it.<TIE>.<TIE>.” This implies that the owner was not with him either at the time he borrowed and at the time of breaking and death. For the phrase, “if the owner is not with him” refers back to both stages. And then, “he must make full restitution.” This means that if he was with him during only one of these times, he does @ITnot@it have to make restitution.  However, it says [in our verse]: “If the owner is with him, then he need not make restitution” — [implying that] the reason [for no restitution] is that the owner was with him at @ITboth@it stages. And this means that if he was with him at one stage but not at the other, he is liable. Thus, the verses seem to contradict each other. To resolve this, we must say [as Rashi did,] that the previous verse exempts the borrower even if the owner was with him at @ITone@it of the two stages. That is, he was with him at the time he borrowed, although he was not with him at the time of breaking and death. And the verse that holds the borrower liable, is in the case where the owner was with him at the time of breaking and death but @ITnot@it at the time he borrowed. And we cannot say the other way around, because reason dictates that the time he borrows is the key stage — for that is when the borrower becomes obligated to feed the animal. [See Bava Metzia 96a.] @d1If the ox was not borrowed.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi adds the word “ox,” to teach that “hired” is describing the ox hinted to above (v. 13): “If a man borrows something.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Yet, if “hired” in our verse refers to that, [then a question arises:] how can the ox be both borrowed and hired? Therefore Rashi adds [the word @hh<HEB>אלא@ee<ENG>] and says, “The ox was not borrowed but rather (@hh<HEB>אלא@ee<ENG>) hired.” This teaches that this verse is negating the first case (v. 13), where it was borrowed, and saying that [in our case] it is not borrowed but rather hired. @d1Into the hands of the lessee.@p3 The word @hh<HEB>בא@ee<ENG> [@hh<HEB>בא בשכרו@ee<ENG>, “it comes.<TIE>.<TIE>.”] expresses that one thing comes into another, and our verse is “short” [and does not state what the ox comes into]. Therefore, Rashi had to explain that “it came into the hands of the lessee.” And in order to tell us the reason why the lessee’s law is unlike that of the borrower, who is liable even for accidents, Rashi explains that the ox did not come as a borrowed item, [thus the lessee does not gain all the benefit from this arrangement. His use of the ox] is in return for its rental fee, [thus the lessor benefits as well]. According to this, the words @hh<HEB>בא בשכרו@ee<ENG> are reversed, as it should have said @hh<HEB>בשכרו בא@ee<ENG>, thereby emphasizing the verse’s point: that the ox came through its @ITrental price@it rather than through borrowing it [free of charge]. And since the point being made is that the lessee does @ITnot@it pay for accidents, and it does not teach us what @ITis@it his law, the Sages disagreed as to what law is he subject: whether he is like a @hh<HEB>שומר חנם@ee<ENG> or a @hh<HEB>שומר שכר@ee<ENG>. @p1[15]@p2<TIE>He must set aside a dowry for her.@p3 Rashi explains [as he does] because if @hh<HEB>מהר ימהרנה@ee<ENG> denoted @hh<HEB>מְהִירוּת@ee<ENG> (speed) rather than @hh<HEB>מוֹהַר@ee<ENG> (dowry), then there should be a @ITpatach@it under the @ITmem@it [@hb<HEB>מַ@hhהֵר יְ@hbמַ@hhהֲרֶנָּה@ee<ENG>]. Because in all of Scripture, @hh<HEB>מְהִירוּת@ee<ENG> is written in the verbal form that has a @ITdagesh@it [i.e., in the @ITpi’el@it form]. @d1As is the law regarding a man and his wife.@p3 [Rashi is explaining that the dowry comes only with their marriage,] rather than him giving it to her immediately as a fine. For otherwise, why does it say [in the next verse], “If her father utterly refuses to give her to him, he must give the weight of silver.<TIE>.<TIE>.”? But he already gave her the fine! @p1[17]@p2<TIE>But she must be put to death by the court.@p3 [Rashi is explaining that] it is not like, “You shall not allow any soul to live” (Devarim 20:16), where [it means that] any person may kill that individual. Rather, a witch is put to death by the court. And the Sages disagreed as to what method of death is the witch punished; some say it is death by the sword, as [described in the verse,] “You shall not allow any soul to live,” and some say it is death by stoning, as [described] in (Shemos 19:13), “Neither man or beast shall be allowed to live.” @d1Whether they are male or female.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because regarding @hh<HEB>אוב וידעוני@ee<ENG>, which are types of witches, the Torah made no difference between man and woman. For it is written, “Man or woman” (Vayikra 20:27). (@ITRashi, Sanhedrin@it 67a)<QC>
@p1[19]@p2<TIE>He must be put to death.@p3 [Rashi is explaining] that this instance of @hh<HEB>יחרם@ee<ENG> [does not mean “dedicated, rather it] means “death”, as in: “Any condemned person (@hh<HEB>חרם@ee<ENG>) who has been banned shall not be redeemed; he shall surely be put to death” (Vayikra 27:29). (@ITRashi, Sanhedrin@it 60a) @d1Or is not the usual way of worshipping it.@p3 Because the verse did not say, “He who @ITworships@it a god through slaughtering must be condemned,” we learn that [the law applies] even when this is not the usual way of worshipping it. (@ITRashi, Sanhedrin@it 60a) @d1His penalty is not death, but he transgresses a negative precept.@p3 Rashi means that this applies [only] if it is @ITnot@it the usual way of worshipping it. Whereas if it is the usual way, we derive from “How did these nations worship.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (Devarim 12:30), that all [usual] ways are punished with death, as Rashi explained the verse, “How did these nations worship.<TIE>.<TIE>.”<QC>
@p1[20]@p2<TIE>He, too, is capable of abusing you.@p3 And consequently, “for you were strangers” just refers back to “You must not abuse,” which means “abusive words.” But “for you were strangers” is not the reason for “nor oppress a stranger,” which means “robbing him of his money.” For the fact that we were strangers is not the reason to refrain [from robbing him]. @d1The term @HB<HEB>גר@BO<ENG>.<TIE>.<TIE>. a person who was not.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is explaining that @ITall@it Yisrael were @hh<HEB>גרים@ee<ENG>, even Avraham, Yitzchak and Yaakov, [not just the Bnei Yisrael in Egypt]. For the term @hh<HEB>גר@ee<ENG> means someone who is not a native citizen of that country. [And about the @ITAvos@it it says (Bereishis 21:34), @hh<HEB>ויגר@ee<ENG> (“He sojourned”), which comes from the same root as @hh<HEB>גר@ee<ENG>.] @p1[22]@p2<TIE>But does not make clear his punishment.@p3 The word @hh<HEB>כי@ee<ENG> always gives a reason for the point made before it. Thus we must say this is a “short” verse [since it omitted the point that the reason explains]. It is as if the verse is saying: “If you do mistreat him, @ITin the end you will get yours. Why?@it When he cries out to Me.<TIE>.<TIE>.” This is as Rashi himself explained.<QC>
@p1[24]@p2<TIE>One of My people has priority.@p3 [You might ask: Is it not obvious that a Jew has priority over a gentile]? The answer is: [The law applies] even if the gentile is giving interest and the [Jewish] poor person is not. Even so, “one of My people has priority.”<QC>
@p1[25]@p2<TIE>But rather the security.<TIE>.<TIE>. from the borrower.@p3 This is why the verse says afterwards, “[you must return it to him] till sunset.” Whereas if you took it at the time of the loan, you need not return it. @d1A garment worn by day.@p3 The @ITNachalas Yaakov@it explains: Since it is written [in the next verse], “With what shall he lie down?” it is obvious that it is referring to a garment worn by night. [Thus we might think that this verse, too, is the same.] And when it is written, “You must return it to him till sunset,” it means @ITbefore@it sunset, as in the verse, “Before (@hh<HEB>עד@ee<ENG>) I came to you” (Bereishis 48:5). Or [it could mean] that till sunset the garment remains in your hand, and then you should return it to him. Therefore, Rashi [needed to] explain that it is referring to “a garment worn by day.” [Rashi knows this] since he explained in @ITParshas Ki Seitzei@it that “and he will lie down in his garment” (Devarim 24:13) [refers to a garment worn by night. Thus, this verse must refer] to a garment worn by day. And [here, following our verse,] it concludes: “With what shall he lie down?” to also include [various types of other] garments [and bedding] used at night.  You might ask: What does the lender gain by taking the security from him, if he has to return it [every day]? The Gemara (Bava Metzia 114b) already answered: If he lends with a security, the shmittah year does not release the loan. Furthermore, [if the borrower dies,] the security will @ITnot@it be considered as moveable possessions of the orphans. Therefore these  possesions cannot be collected by the creditor. @p1[27]@p2<TIE>The prohibition against cursing judges.@p3 [Rashi’s two explanations appear in] @ITSanhedrin@it 66a: R. Yosei holds that @hh<HEB>אלהים@ee<ENG> is a mundane word and the verse is a prohibition against cursing a judge, and R. Akiva holds that @hh<HEB>אלהים@ee<ENG> is a sacred word, and the verse is a prohibition against cursing Hashem. And according to both views, we learn both laws from our verse — since it is not written @hh<HEB>תקל@ee<ENG> , [rather it is written@hh<HEB>תקלל@ee<ENG>,] which Rashi explains as implying two curses. And the word @hh<HEB>אלהים@ee<ENG> [which is plural] also contains two meanings. Therefore we apply @hh<HEB>תקלל@ee<ENG> to both of them [i.e., to Hashem and judges]. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it)<QC>
@p1[28]@p2<TIE>When your grains reach their full ripeness.@p3 [Rashi is saying: The meaning is] not that [it is a collective obligation, and] @ITevery@it person must not delay. Therefore he explains that it means: “When @ITyour@it grains reach their full ripeness,” meaning, when @ITyou@it have [such grains, do not delay them]. @d1Do not alter their order of separating them.@p3 We cannot say [that the verse means simply] not to delay giving the first fruits, because the Torah does not expressly set any time-limit on them. Therefore we must say [as Rashi did, that] it means: do not delay it until after the next mitzvah [i.e., separating @ITterumah@it]. @d1By redeeming him for five @BIsela’im.@p3 Rashi means: not that you shall give the child itself to Me. [That cannot be,] because in @ITParshas Korach@it (Bamidbar 18:15) it is written, “But you must surely @ITredeem@it the firstborn of man.” @d1You must do likewise with your @BIoxen@BO.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 The @ITNachalas Yaakov@it says that there is a mistake in our text of Rashi. It should [continue after “You must do likewise,”] and say: “with your @ITsheep@it.” Firstly, because Rashi concludes with: “the smaller cattle” [which means sheep and goats]. And there is another reason that is mentioned there [in @ITNachalas Yaakov@it.]<QC>
@p1[29]@p2<TIE>This is a warning to the @BIkohein.@p3 However, a person may consecrate his animal [as a sacrifice] even if it is only one day old. This warning, [i.e.,] negative commandment, is part of the positive commandment of “Seven days it shall remain.<TIE>.<TIE>.” [and thus is judged as a positive commandment]. @d1This is the intended meaning of it.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi means that since there is a @ITgezeirah shavah @itof “the eighth day,” thus we understand that “On the eighth day you must give it to Me” means that you are permitted, but not obligated. @p1[30]@p2<TIE> From the abhorrence of @BIneveilah@BO and @BItereifah.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi adds the word “if”, [“@ITIf@it you will be holy.<TIE>.<TIE>.], because it says afterwards, “And you must not eat flesh that was torn off in the field.” Rashi adds this so we will not explain “Be men of holiness” as a command, saying: “So shall you be.<TIE>.<TIE>. to Me.” [Rather, the meaning is as follows.] Because there are many things which, whether we do them or not, God does not distance us from being His, therefore the verse had to say here that @ITif@it you do not abstain from the abhorrence of @ITneveilah@it etc, then “you are not Mine.” This is the main message of the verse; it does not merely teach us the prohibition [of eating tornoff flesh]. @d1The same applies within the house.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because elsewhere @ITneveilah@it and @ITtereifah@it are written together, to compare them and teach us: just as eating @ITneveilah @itis forbidden whether it is in the house or in the field, so too concerning @ITtereifah.@it<QC>
@p1[1]@p2<TIE>You promise him that you will be a corrupt witness.@p3 [The case is that] the claimant already has one false witness [to support his claim]. And the verse is warning this [potential second] witness: Do not join with that false witness, who is “a wicked man.”<QC>
@p1[2]@p2<TIE>And let the collar hang from the necks of the majority.@p3 Rashi means that you should not say: “What difference will it make if I judge the case truthfully? They are the majority and I am one person, and they will not heed me.” Rather, you should do your duty, “and let the collar.<TIE>.<TIE>.”<QC>
@p1[3]@p2<TIE> And say, “He is poor. I will find in his favor and show him regard.”@p3 Rashi had to explain that the regard shown the poor man is [not actually treating him with honor but] judging in his favor, because the natural tendency of a judge is to treat only a rich man with honor — as it says, “You shall not show regard to a @ITprominent@it man” (Vayikra 19:15). Therefore, Rashi explains that the regard shown here [to the poor man] is by judging him favorably, and through this he will be looked upon with regard. For otherwise he would have to pay, and since he cannot, he will be disgraced.<QC>
@p1[8]@p2<TIE>Judgments of truth.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 In other words, Torah judgment, as it is written [about the Torah], “The judgments of Hashem are true.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (Tehillim 19:10). @p1[9]@p2<TIE>Because @HB<HEB>סורו@BO<ENG> is bad.@p3 Some explain @hh<HEB>סורו@ee<ENG> as @hh<HEB>שְׂאוֹר@ee<ENG> (leaven), referring to his evil inclination — which is strong and bad, thus the stranger is easy to tempt [away from the path of the Torah]. Others explain [@hh<HEB>סורו@ee<ENG> as @hh<HEB>סָר@ee<ENG> (stray). This means that] once he strays from the path [of the Torah], he cannot be [easily] persuaded to return. @p1[11]@p2<TIE>From working.@p3 Rashi explains this way because @hh<HEB>שמיטה@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>נטישה@ee<ENG> always imply releasing a thing from something else. [Thus, the fields are released from working.] @d1Hoeing.@p3 In Moed Katan (3a), Rashi explains @hh<HEB>לקשקש@ee<ENG> as hoeing under trees to make them grow. But in Bava Metzia (89b) Rashi explains it as covering tree roots with straw (@hh<HEB>קש@ee<ENG>) and manure, in the winter, so the cold will not damage them. @d1So, too, do the poor eat without tithing.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi explains it this way] because otherwise, why does it say, “What they leave over, the beasts of the field can eat”? It cannot be to permit the beasts to eat it in the seventh year, because these beasts are not under one’s control. @d1But the beginning of the verse deals with a grain-field.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is explaining that the words “do the same” refer back to the beginning of the verse: just as you did with the grain-field, do the same with your vineyard. @p1[12]@p2<TIE>Do not cancel the weekly Shabbos.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi explains it this way] because otherwise, why is [this verse, speaking of Shabbos,] juxtaposed to [the previous verse, speaking of] the seventh year? Although this verse needed to be written for the new laws it contains, that an uncircumcised slave, a stranger and a settler must rest on Shabbos, nevertheless, we learn this matter (not to cancel the weekly Shabbos) as well. @d1Allow it to relax, permitting it to tear up.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi explains it this way] because otherwise, why is it said here, “So that your ox and your donkey may rest”? This was already said in the Ten Commandments. And if it is written in order that we will not say, “Since the entire year is called Shabbos.<TIE>.<TIE>.” then the phrase “But on the seventh day you must cease” would be sufficient. @d1An uncircumcised slave.@p3 Before, in the Ten Commandments, it spoke of a gentile slave who is circumcised. Here, it speaks of one who is uncircumcised — but still within twelve months of being purchased. However, his master may not keep an uncircumcised gentile slave longer than this, if the slave does not want to undergo circumcision. @d1@HB<HEB>גר תושב@BO<ENG> — “a settler.”@p3 [Rashi knows this] because if it was referring to a convert to Judaism, it is already written: “and the foreigner (@hh<HEB>גר@ee<ENG>) within your gates.” Alternatively, [Rashi knows this] because a convert is full Jew [and need not be mentioned separately]. @p1[13]@p2<TIE>To make every positive precept as a negative precept.@p3 This is why a positive precept always overrides a negative precept (@hh<HEB>עשה דוחה את לא תעשה@ee<ENG>). For every positive precept includes a negative precept. Thus it has both, and therefore a positive precept overrides a single negative precept. @d1Next to such and such an idol.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi explains it this way] because otherwise, why is it necessary [to forbid this]? Is there any reason that a Jew would mention the name of an idolatry that he denies, and regarding which he is commanded to destroy?<QC>
@p1[15]@p2<TIE>Bring Me burnt-offerings.@p3 We cannot say that the verse refers to [gifts of] money, because it says, “My Presence”. And one greets the Presence of the Master only with a sacrifice. But the Mechilta learns [that it means burnt-offerings and not money, as follows]: It says “joy” regarding people [i.e., that they should rejoice on the festivals by eating the meat of peace offerings.] And it says “joy” regarding Heaven.<TIE>.<TIE>. Just as the joy regarding people is with something fit for people [i.e., something they eat], so too the joy of Heaven is with something fit for Heaven, such as burnt-offerings [of which the entire sacrifice is consumed upon the Altar.] This is because it is not right that your table should be full, while the table [i.e., Altar] of your Maker is empty. (Re’m) @p1[16]@p2<TIE>This refers to the holiday of Shavuos.@p3 Rashi [knows this,] as he goes on to explain, because it states (Bamidbar 28:26): “On the Day of Bikkurim (@hh<HEB>בכורים@ee<ENG>) .<TIE>.<TIE>. on your Festival of Shavuos.<TIE>.<TIE>.” And here, too, it is written: “The Festival of Harvest, the first fruits (@hh<HEB>בכורי@ee<ENG>) of your labor.” Just as the @hh<HEB>בכורים@ee<ENG> there refers to Shavuos, so too the @hh<HEB>בכורי@ee<ENG> here refers to Shavuos. @d1Permit the new crop for meal offerings.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Whereas the Omer meal offering, brought on the 16th of Nissan, was of barley. Yet the Sotah’s meal offering, also of barley, is not brought from the new crop until the offering of the “two loaves”, which are of wheat, are brought. @p1[17]@p2<TIE>It was necessary to state.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: It has already been stated elsewhere, “Three times a year.<TIE>.<TIE>.” [So why is the mitzvah repeated here?] (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it). But it seems to me that this is what Rashi means: Since the Festivals depend on working with the grain — @hh<HEB>חג האביב חג הקציר חג האסיף@ee<ENG> — and during @ITshemittah,@it harvesting the grain and gathering it into the house are forbidden, we might think that the Festivals, too, do not apply. Thus, our verse tells us otherwise.<QC>
@d1The males among you.@p3 Rashi says @hh<HEB>הזכרים@ee<ENG> (males) to tell us that @hh<HEB>זְכ@hbוּ@hhרְךָ@ee<ENG> with a @ITmelupum@it has the same meaning as @hh<HEB>זָכָר@ee<ENG> with a @ITkamatz@it (and both mean “male”). And he says “among you” to tell us that the suffix of @hh<HEB>זְכוּרְ@hbךָ@ee<ENG> is a substitute for @hh<HEB>בך@ee<ENG> (among you) rather than a substitute for @hh<HEB>שלך@ee<ENG> (belonging to you). [Rashi knows this] because a son does not “belong” to his father like @hh<HEB>ביתך ושדך@ee<ENG>. Thus, @hh<HEB>זְכוּרְךָ@ee<ENG> means the males who are among you and your nation. @p1[18]@p2<TIE>Do not slaughter the Pesach @BIkorbon.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi says “Pesach @ITkorbon@it” where the verse says @hh<HEB>דם זבחי@ee<ENG> to tell us that here, @hh<HEB>זבחי@ee<ENG> (“My sacrifice”) refers only to the Pesach @ITkorbon@it and not the @ITChagigah korbon.@it And Rashi says “On the fourteenth day of Nisan” to tell us that this prohibition applies only on the 14th of Nisan and not the rest of the year. And he says “Until you @ITremove@it your @ITchametz@it” whereas the verse says @hh<HEB>על חמץ@ee<ENG>, because @hh<HEB>על חמץ@ee<ENG> literally means on top of the @ITchametz.@it Therefore he explained, “Until you @ITremove@it your @ITchametz@it” [from your possession]. @d1Away from the Altar.@p3 Meaning, [do not leave the fat away from the Altar] when its blood was cast on the Altar during the day. For then, if the fats are left on the floor, i.e., away from the Altar until dawn, they become unfit because of @hh<HEB>לינה@ee<ENG> (remaining overnight). (@ITMegillah@it 20)<QC>
@d1All night.@p3 Rashi means that the verse, “It is the burnt-offering on the fireplace, on the Altar all night.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (Vayikra 6:2) does not teach that after morning arrives, one may no longer burn the offering on the Altar. Rather, it teaches that if the offering was brought onto the Altar even a moment before dawn, it is fit to be burnt there also after dawn. We need not ask: If so, why do we need two verses, [this verse and “.<TIE>.<TIE>.on the fireplace”]? The answer is: “.<TIE>.<TIE>.on the fireplace” comes mainly to teach a mitzvah: we should bring the offerings onto the Altar from the time of sunset and leave them there all night so they will be burnt well. By the way, we also learn that if they were up on the Altar’s wood-pile [before dawn], they are fit to be burnt on the Altar even after dawn — as is implied by this verse, “You must not allow to remain.<TIE>.<TIE>.” With this, all the difficulties of @ITRe’m@it’s are resolved. @p1[19]@p2<TIE>Even during the seventh year @BIbikkurim@BO is obligatory.@p3 In some texts of Rashi, [the obligation of @ITbikkurim@it in the seventh year is not mentioned.] It is written only, “‘The first fruits of your land.’ A man who, upon entering his field.<TIE>.<TIE>.” And so write Re’m and @ITGur Aryeh@it that [those texts are correct, because] during the seventh year there is no mitzvah of @ITbikkurim.@it This is because a person cannot declare, [as is required when bringing @ITbikkurim@it]: “And now, I have brought.<TIE>.<TIE>. from the land that You have given me” (Devarim 26:10). For the land was not given to him in the seventh year; rather it is ownerless, for all [to eat its fruits]. @d1He ties a reed around it to identify it.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because if not, how can he know which are his first fruits and which are not?<QC>
@d1Only from the seven species.@p3 This is learned through the @ITgezeirah shavah@it of @hh<HEB>ארץ ארץ@ee<ENG> (Menachos 84b). Rashi had to explain this so we will not object that people will have to constantly search the forests and fields for all species in order to find the fruit that ripened first, in order to bring it as @ITbikkurim@it. @d1From the fact that you find in a number of places in the Torah.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi explains this] so that you will not object: Since it is written @hh<HEB>גדי עזים@ee<ENG>, perhaps this constitutes a @ITbinyan av@it (prototype), and teaches that wherever it says @hh<HEB>גדי@ee<ENG>, it means @hh<HEB>גדי עזים@ee<ENG> (goat). Therefore Rashi explains that we find @hh<HEB>גדי עזים@ee<ENG> in other places, so it is a case of @hh<HEB>שלשה כתובים הבאים כאחד ואין מלמדין@ee<ENG> (three verses which teach the same thing, do not make a @ITbinyan av.@it) And even according to the opinion that two verses can make a @ITbinyan av,@it here since there are three verses [all would agree that] there is no @ITbinyan av.@it @p1[20]@p2<TIE>For I will not go up among you.@p3 Although Moshe Rabbeinu nullified this decree, as it says, “My Presence @ITwill@it go [with you]” (Shemos 33:14), the decree nevertheless returned in Yehoshua’s time — as [the angel] said [to Yehoshua]: “I, the prince of Hashem’s legion, have now come” (Yehoshua 5:14). See Ramban. @d1My Place has already been set up in line with it.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because otherwise, it should say: “that I have prepared @ITfor you@it.” Whereas “I prepared” standing on its own means [that God prepared] for Himself.<QC>
@p1[22]@p2<TIE>As Onkelos translates it: “I will oppress.”@p3 [Rashi says this so that] we will not explain it as in, “You will bundle (@hh<HEB>וצרת@ee<ENG>) the coins in your hand” (Devarim 14:25). @p1[24]@p2<TIE>Their idols.@p3 [Rashi is saying that @hh<HEB>תהרסם@ee<ENG> refers to their idols] but not to those who worship them — just as @hh<HEB>כמעשיהם@ee<ENG>, written just before it [which refers to the people’s deeds but not the people themselves]. @p1[26]@p2<TIE>If you act according to My will.@p3 In other words, the whole verse refers back to “You must serve Adonoy, your God.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (v. 25). It is saying, so to speak: “Serve Adonoy, and then I will bless your bread and your water.<TIE>.<TIE>. and no woman will suffer miscarriage.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Otherwise, it would not make sense. For the Torah would not state that no woman will suffer miscarriage, without stating the condition of “if you do My will.” Thus, we must say that the whole verse refers back to “You must serve Adonoy.<TIE>.<TIE>.”<QC>
@p1[28]@p2<TIE>The hornets did not cross.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi says this] so you will not ask regarding what he explained, “It.<TIE>.<TIE>. would strike them.<TIE>.<TIE>. and they would die,” and say that this cannot be — for Yehoshua fought against them seven years! Thus Rashi explains that “the hornets did not cross.<TIE>.<TIE>.”<QC>
@p1[29]@p2<TIE>Is to be understood as @HB<HEB>ותרבה עליך@BO<ENG>.@p3 You might ask: Why does Rashi not explain here as he does later in Parshas Eikev (Devarim 7:22) on the verse, “Lest the wild animals multiply against you”? [For there he said,] “But behold, if they do the will of God then they need not fear the beasts.<TIE>.<TIE>. Rather, [the verse implies that] God knew they are destined to sin.” It seems that [Rashi did not say so here because] it is written here, “Lest the land become desolate and the beasts of the field multiply.” This implies that the verse is explaining that the many beasts are a result of the desolation of the land, [rather than being an allusion that they are destined to sin]. Another answer: Here it is written (v. 20), “Behold, I will send an angel.<TIE>.<TIE>.” on which Rashi explained, “Here they are foretold that they are destined to sin.” So Rashi does not need to explain this point again here. @p1[31]@p2<TIE>And you will drive them away. @HB<HEB>ותגרשם@BO<ENG>.@p3 In other words, [Rashi is explaining that] this is in future tense, and that [the suffix] is plural.<QC>
@p1[33]@p2<TIE>This (the usage here) is actually @HB<HEB>אי@BO<ENG>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: The word@hh<HEB>כי@ee<ENG> can convey only one of four meanings: @hh<HEB>אי@ee<ENG> (if), @hh<HEB>דלמא@ee<ENG> (perhaps), @hh<HEB>אלא@ee<ENG> (but), and @hh<HEB>דהא@ee<ENG> (because). But it does not convey @hh<HEB>אשר@ee<ENG> (that). [So why here does it convey @hh<HEB>אשר@ee<ENG>?] Rashi answers that this @hh<HEB>כי@ee<ENG> conveys the meaning of @hh<HEB>אי@ee<ENG>, which is the same as @hh<HEB>אם@ee<ENG>. And we often find that @hh<HEB>אם@ee<ENG> conveys @hh<HEB>אשר@ee<ENG>, for example @hh<HEB>אם תקריב@ee<ENG>, “That you will offer.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (Vayikra 2:14). @p1[1]@p2<TIE>On the 4th of Sivan.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because afterwards it is written (v. 3), “Moshe came and told the people.<TIE>.<TIE>.” and Rashi explains that Moshe told it to them on that same day. [And that verse goes on to say that Moshe told them] “all the words of Adonoy.” And Rashi explains that this is the command to separate from their wives. And Rashi explained earlier, in Parshas Yisro (19:9—10), that the mitzvah of separation was on the 4th of Sivan.<QC>
@p1[3]@p2<TIE>The command to separate [from their wives] and the setting up of boundaries.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because it says afterwards (v. 4), “He arose early in the morning, and built an altar beneath the mountain,” and that must have been on the 5th day, as Rashi explained earlier in @ITParshas Yisro.@it Therefore, what he told the people was one day earlier, on the 4th day, as Rashi explained above that the mitzvah of separation was told to them on the 4th day. The @ITRe’m@it was puzzled by this, for in Gemara Shabbos (86a) it is clear that according to all opinions, Moshe told them the mitzvah of setting up boundaries on the 3rd of the month, and they separated from their wives on the 4th. Yet from Rashi here, we see that both these mitzvos were on the 4th. The @ITRe’m@it left this unresolved. The @ITGur Aryeh@it writes that the @ITRe’m@it did not analyze this sufficiently. For [these mitzvos] were surely told to them on the 3rd of the month, but the actual separation was only on the 4th of the month. He brought a proof for this; see what he wrote there.<QC>
@p1[4]@p2<TIE>On the fifth of Sivan.@p3 Rashi writes this to inform us that Moshe’s ascent to the mountain with Nadav and Avihu and the elders, to receive the Torah, was on the day following this: the 6th of Sivan. [Thus, Rashi is explaining it] not like R. Yosei, who said that it was on the 7th. @p1[5]@p2<TIE>The first-born.@p3  The @ITNachalas Yaakov@it writes that sacrifices were offered by the first-born [not only now, before the Giving of the Torah, but even afterward,] until the @ITMishkan@it was actually constructed. This is true even though the Levites were chosen right after the sin of the Golden Calf [to take their place]. This is different from the @ITRe’m’s@it approach; see what he wrote there. @p1[6]@p2<TIE>An angel came and divided it.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because otherwise, it should first say that Moshe divided it, and then say that he took half of it. @p1[7]@p2<TIE>From Bereishis till the Giving of the Torah.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Therefore it is called [“@ITthe@it Book,”] with @hh<HEB>ה"א הידיעה@ee<ENG>, because it is referring to what was mentioned before (v. 4), “Moshe wrote down.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1[8]@p2<TIE>The meaning of sprinkling.@p3 The word @hh<HEB>זרק@ee<ENG> is an expression meaning the same as as in, “And I will sprinkle (@hh<HEB>וזרקתי@ee<ENG>) purifying water upon you” (Yechezkel 36:25). But it does have the meaning as in, “And let Moshe cast (@hh<HEB>ויזרוק@ee<ENG>) it heavenward” (Shemos 9:8), which means actual throwing. @d1Onkelos translates it [literally]: “He cast it on the altar<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>@d2 And not actually on the people, for it is written, (24, 6) “sprinkled on the altar.” @p1[10]@p2<TIE>They intentionally looked and intently gazed.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 This means that they intellectually perceived, as Rashi explains on the next verse: [@hh<HEB>היו מסתכלין בו @hbבלב@hh גס@ee<ENG>]. But it cannot mean actually looking, because it is written (33:20), “For no man can see My Presence and live.” And they became liable for death because [through this “looking”], they entered past their designated area.<QC>
@p1[12]@p2<TIE>All 613 commandments are .<TIE>.<TIE>. in the Ten Commandments.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because it says, “[The Torah and the commandment] which @ITI@it have written in order to teach them.” This cannot refer to the Torah scroll@IT,@it because that was written by Moshe, not Hashem, as it says (Devarim 31:24): “When @ITMoshe@it finished writing the words of this Torah in a book, till they were completed.” Thus we must say that this verse speaks of [God’s writing] the Ten Commandments, [which contain all the 613 mitzvos]. @p1[14]@p2<TIE>When he left the camp.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because otherwise, how were the elders here [outside the camp]? Only Moshe and Yehoshua left the camp as it is written (v. 13), “Moshe and Yehoshua, his attendant, set out.” @d1And remain here with the rest of the people in the camp.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 With this, Rashi resolves many issues [that could arise with the verse]. He explains that the word @hh<HEB>שבו@ee<ENG> does not mean literally [“to sit”]; rather it means “to remain.” Also, he explains that @hh<HEB>בזה@ee<ENG> refers to a place (the camp) rather than to a certain object that [the verse] hints to. Also, he explains that the elders should not remain by themselves but with the rest of the people, since the elders did not leave the camp [as explained previously]. And Rashi also informs us that they remained in camp in order to render decisions for the people. Otherwise, [Moshe’s order to the elders to remain] in the camp would be no different from [the order given to] all of Yisrael [who also remained in the camp]. @d1He was Miriam’s son.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: How could Moshe say that Aharon and Chur will be with them [to render decisions, but they are only two and a court of law needs three judges]? If two render a decision, their judgment is invalid. And even according to the opinion that holds that their judgment is valid, such a court would be called insolent. Therefore Rashi explained that Chur was Miriam’s son. This forces us to say that the two would not judge together, since they were relatives. For according to all views, a first generation relative and a second generation relative are unfit to judge together. Rather, it must be that each one rendered decisions on his own, acting as an expert judge who is permitted to render decisions alone. @d1Whoever has a lawsuit.@p3 [Rashi is explaining that] the word @hh<HEB>מי@ee<ENG> is not implying a question. Also, [he is explaining that] @hh<HEB>בעל דברים@ee<ENG> does not mean @hh<HEB>בעל לשון@ee<ENG> (man of speech). Accordingly, we need to add the word @hh<HEB>שהוא@ee<ENG> (who is) in between @hh<HEB>מי@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>בעל@ee<ENG>, [in order to complete the verse] so it will say: “@hh<HEB>מי שהוא בעל דברים@ee<ENG> (whoever has a lawsuit).” Rashi hints to this by adding the word @hh<HEB>שיש@ee<ENG> (who@ITever has@it).<QC>
@p1[16]@p2<TIE>The mountain.@p3 [If the six days that are referred to in the verse took place before the giving of the Ten Commandments, we must say that the cloud covered the mountain] but not Moshe. For right afterward it says, “He called to Moshe” to proclaim the Ten Commandments. And it cannot be that Moshe was covered in the cloud all six days, because Moshe was going up and down the mountain each day as it says in @ITParshas Yisro.@it But according to the opinion [that Rashi mentions later,] that holds that “He called to Moshe” took place @ITafter@it the Ten Commandments were given, at the beginning of the forty days, then @hh<HEB>ויכסהו הענן@ee<ENG> refers to Moshe — because “whoever intends to enter the camp of the Shechinah.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @d1To proclaim the Ten Commandments.@p3 All agree that “Come up to Me to the mountain” (v. 12) took place @ITafter@it the Giving of the Torah, as Rashi wrote previously. Nevertheless, the Torah then went back to relate [the events] according to the order [in which they happened]. First it writes the story of the Ten Commandments, and afterward the story of [Moshe going up to receive] the Tablets (v. 18): “.<TIE>.<TIE>.Moshe remained on the mountain for forty days and forty nights.” @d1Requires seclusion for six days.@p3 This is like the Kohein Gadol who requires seclusion for seven days before Yom Kippur, since he enters the Kodesh HaKodoshim. Surely this [need for seclusion] applies as well to one who enters the camp of the Shechinah.<QC>
@p1[2]@p2<TIE>@hb<HEB>לי@hh@ee@BO<ENG> means for the sake of My Name.@p3 Everything in the world is His, [therefore it cannot mean, “so it will be Mine.”] @d1Setting aside.@d2 Rashi is explaining that here it does not mean “lifting up,” as it does in (29:27): “The shoulder of the @ITterumah@it-offering.” (@ITRe”m@it) @d1Let them set aside from their possessions a donation.@d2 Rashi is answering the question: Since @ITterumah@it here means “setting aside,” why does it not have a fixed amount, like @ITterumah@it taken from grain and wine? Therefore Rashi explains that it is “from their possessions,” [not from their fields,] so it has no fixed amount. Alternatively, Rashi is answering the question: If @ITterumah@it here means “setting aside,” why does the verse not state first @ITwhat@it they are to set aside, and then write, “Have them take for Me a @ITterumah@it-offering”? Thus Rashi adds the words, “From their possessions.” [This answers also a second] question: Does the verse not imply that the @ITterumah@it should come from their very selves, as it is written, “A @ITterumah@it-offering from every man”? Therefore Rashi explains, “Let them set aside from @ITtheir possessions@it a donation.” This answers everything. “Have them take for Me a @ITterumah@it-offering” indeed means “set aside,” as Rashi said, “Let them @ITset aside@it from their possessions.” And we need not say that the @ITterumah@it comes from their very selves, because it comes from their possessions. Accordingly, “From every man” is not to be read with the preceding phrase, “@ITterumah@it-offering,” but with the phrase following “Whose heart impels him.” And since we might think that this setting aside is obligatory, Rashi tells us that it is a good-will donation, as implied by, “Whose heart impels him to generosity.” (@ITRe”m@it) @d1The same root as @hb<HEB>נדבה@BO<ENG>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 It is as if it said @hh<HEB>י@hbנ@hhדבנו@ee<ENG>, for the @hh<HEB>נ@ee<ENG> is represented by the @ITdagesh@it of the @hh<HEB>ד@ee<ENG>. @d1The expression @hb<HEB>תרומה@BO<ENG> is mentioned here three times.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 However, Scripture explains here only the @IT“terumah@itoffering for the@IT mishkon@it — the donation of each individual.” Otherwise, [if it does not allude to three different @ITterumah@it-offerings,] why does it say @hh<HEB>תרומתי@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>וזאת התרומה@ee<ENG>? Scripture should have written: @hh<HEB>ויקחו לי תרומה מאת כל איש אשר ידבנו לבו זהב וכסף ונחשת@ee<ENG>. @d1The thirteen items mentioned.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 [Question: Are there not fifteen items listed here? The answer is:] Greenish-blue, dark red and crimson are all of wool, just with different dyes [so they count as one]. Another answer: The onyx stones and filling stones were brought by the leaders of the tribes, while Rashi is counting what the public donated.<QC>
@p1[3]@p2<TIE>The rest of the silver which @BIwas @bibrought.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 [Rashi is answering the question: If] the silver was [obligatory, it was] different from the other donations. So why is it written here? We cannot say that the people brought silver twice, and the silver here was a goodwill donation like the other items, whereas the [obligatory] half-shekel was different silver. This is not so, for Rashi says: “We do not find in all the works of the @ITmishkon@it that any more silver was needed.” Rashi answers: In fact there are two types of silver [included here. One was obligatory, and the other, not]. Although we said that no more silver was needed, this is not a difficulty, because “the rest of the silver which was brought voluntarily, they made from it the holy vessels,” [and it was not significant enough for Scripture to mention expressly]. @p1[4]@p2<TIE>Wool that is dyed with the blood.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Rashi explains @hh<HEB>ארגמן@ee<ENG>, too, as dyed wool. His proof is from the priestly vestments, which were made of these four types — @hh<HEB>תכלת@ee<ENG>, @hh<HEB>ארגמן@ee<ENG>, @hh<HEB>תולעת שני@ee<ENG>, @hh<HEB>ושש@ee<ENG> — yet in Scripture it is not written what material they were. But in Yechezkel 44:17, regarding the @ITkohanim’s@it garb on Yom Kippur, it is written: “They shall wear vestments of linen, and vestments of wool shall not come upon them.” This implies that during the year they wore linen @ITand@it wool vestments, but no other material. About the @ITkohanim’s@it pants it is written (39:28): @hh<HEB>ואת מכנסי הבד שש משזר@ee<ENG>. Since @hh<HEB>בד@ee<ENG> is linen, @hh<HEB>שש@ee<ENG> is linen. And if @hh<HEB>שש@ee<ENG> is linen, then @hh<HEB>תכלת@ee<ENG> must be wool, [because the @ITkohanim@it wore only linen and wool]. It cannot be the other way around because we see clearly that @hh<HEB>שש@ee<ENG> is linen. And since @hh<HEB>תכלת@ee<ENG> of the priestly vestments is [dyed] wool, also @hh<HEB>ארגמן@ee<ENG> [and @hh<HEB>תולעת שני@ee<ENG>] must be types of dyed wool, [as all the dyed types were assumedly of the same material. But @hh<HEB>שש@ee<ENG> was not dyed]. @d1Hair of goats.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 [Rashi knows this] because if it meant @ITskins@it of goats, Scripture should have written @hh<HEB>עורות עזים@ee<ENG> [as it is written for rams’ skins in next verse]. It is written “goats” instead of “goats’ hair” because they spun the threads from [the hair that was attached to] the goats themselves. @p1[5]@p2<TIE>[They were dyed] red after they were tanned.@d2 [Rashi knows this] because if they were naturally red, it should say @hh<HEB>אֲדוּמִים@ee<ENG>, [not @hh<HEB>מְאָדָמִים@ee<ENG>]. @d1A kind of animal which existed only.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 [Question: Does it not say in Yechezkel 16:10 that they made shoes from @ITtachash@it leather all the forty years that they were in the desert? The answer is:] The tachash of Yechezkel was a species of impure animal called @ITTala Ilan@it (Shabbos 28a). @d1Where did they get it in the desert.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 [Rashi asks this] because it is written in Yeshaya 41:19: “I will place cedar, acacia.<TIE>.<TIE>. in the desert,” implying that in the future it will be so, but now it is not. (@ITR. Noson@it) @p1[6]@p2<TIE>Clear olive oil.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Rashi is answering the question: [Since it says, “Oil”,] why does it need to say, “For the lamp”? Thus he explains: Because this is “@ITclear@it olive oil,” and is unique. They needed to pluck the [sun-ripened] olives from the top of the tree for it, as stated in Menachos 86a. Rashi is also answering the question: Why in fact did this oil need to be different from ordinary oil used for lighting? He answers: “To keep the lamp burning constantly,” so it will not go out. @d1Made for the purpose of anointing the vessels of the @BImishkon.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo [Rashi is answering the question: Since it says, “Spices,” why does it need to say, “For anointing-oil”? Thus] he explains: The spices of the anointing-oil were not just any spices but specifically “pure myrrh, fragrant cinnamon, etc” (30:23). Moshe must have explained to them that the needed spices were pure myrrh, etc., but the verse is brief and simply writes, “For anointing-oil,” without giving the details. @ITRe”m@it elaborates; see there. @d1As is explained in the @BIparsha @hb<HEB>ואתה תצוה@BO<ENG>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 I.e., there it says to burn them evening and morning. The spices themselves are not explained in @hh<HEB>ואתה תצוה@ee<ENG> but in @hh<HEB>כי תשא@ee<ENG>. @ITRe”m@it elaborates; see there. @d1Filling-stones for the breastplate.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Rashi explains this so we will not say that both the onyx stones and the filling stones were for the @ITeiphod@it, and similarly both were for the breastplate. @ITRe”m@it explains that the breastplate, too, had onyx stones. But since “filling stones” include @ITall@it the breastplate’s stones, the “onyx stones” that are stated pertain only to the stones for the @ITeiphod.@it @p1[8]@p2<TIE>They shall make for the sake of My Name a house of holiness.@d2 Rashi is answering two questions. First: Why is it written “for Me,” when everything already belongs to Hashem? Second: Making a @hh<HEB>מקדש@ee<ENG> seemingly implies making any holy item, not necessarily one with an interior. If so, how then can it be written, “And I will dwell in their midst”? How can Hashem’s Presence dwell in something without an interior? Rashi answers: “‘They shall make’ — for the sake of My Name.” And it shall be “a house” — with an interior.<QC>
@p1[9]@p2<TIE>Here, the form of the @BImishkon.<TIE>.<TIE>. @biRashi is saying that we should not think it means, “According to all that I show you later” when you actually make the @ITmishkon.@it Rather, it means, “that I am showing you @IThere@it.” [Rashi knows this] because otherwise it should say, “That I @ITwill@it show you.”<QC>
@p1[11]@p2<TIE>Bezalel made three arks.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo You might ask: How does Rashi know this? Perhaps there was but one ark, gold-plated inside and out as goldsmiths generally make? @ITR. Noson@it answers: This @ITparsha@it is about the making of the ark which held the Tablets. On the Tablets was [written the Ten Commandments, containing] all the letters of the @ITalef beis@it. This is because the [Ten Commandments on the] Tablets contain the entire Torah. This @ITparsha@it of the making of the ark alludes to this by using all the letters of the @ITalef beis,@it which comprise the Torah, except for the letter @hh<HEB>ג@ee<ENG> which is missing. Why? Perforce, there is no need for the allusion of the @hh<HEB>ג@ee<ENG> because the ark itself was made up of three (@hh<HEB>ג@ee<ENG>) layers. An alternative answer: The Torah writes the extra word @hh<HEB>תצפנו@ee<ENG> to teach that afterward, its upper rim should be covered with gold. Thus we may infer that there were three arks placed one within another, thereby making it covered on the inside and on the outside — except for the upper rim, which was covered afterward. @p1[12]@p2<TIE>Two on one side and two on the other, along the width of the ark.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 But if it was two on each side along the @ITlength@it of the ark, two people carrying it could not walk next to each other, since the space between [the poles] was only an @ITamoh@it and a half.<QC>
@p1[15]@p2<TIE>Forever.@d2 [Rashi knows this] because it is written at the beginning of the verse that the poles must remain in the ark’s rings. Why then write afterward that they must not be removed? @d1The Torah, which is testimony.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 [Question:] It is written in 40:20, “He took the Testimony and placed it into the ark,” and Rashi explains it means the Tablets. Furthermore, the Torah was not written until the end of the forty years. [Why then does Rashi here say that “Testimony” means the Torah?] It seems the answer is: In our verse it is written, “The Testimony that I @ITwill@it give you,” in the future tense. But, the Ten Commandments were already given! Although the Tablets were broken, Moshe assumedly wrote it down or he prayed that the Tablets be restored to their original form. Perforce, our verse refers to the entire Torah, which would be written later.<QC>
@p1[17]@p2<TIE>Its thickness was a @BItefach. @bi[Rashi knows this] because in Vayikra 16:2 it is written @hb<HEB>פני@hh הכפורת@ee<ENG>, and @hh<HEB>פנים@ee<ENG> (face) is at least a @ITtefach@it in size. @p1[18]@p2<TIE>They had the likeness of a child’s face.@d2 [Rashi knows this] since it is written ,@hh<HEB>כרובים@ee<ENG> we [could] read it as @hh<HEB>כרביא@ee<ENG>, i.e., “like a youth.” Onkelos [elsewhere] translates “child” as @hh<HEB>רביא@ee<ENG>, and the @hh<HEB>כ@ee<ENG> of @hh<HEB>כרובים@ee<ENG> means “like.” @d1The extreme ends of the cover.@d2 These are the ends of the ark’s length, not its width. [Rashi knows this] because otherwise, one cherub’s back would be to the Tent of Meeting, which is improper. Furthermore, it is written (v. 22): “I will set My meetings with you there, and I will speak with you from above the cover.” If the back of one cherub was toward the Tent of Meeting, its body would be an obstruction between the Tent of Meeting and the place from where Hashem’s voice emanated.<QC>
@p1[20]@p2<TIE>Rather, spread open.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Rashi is saying that the term @hh<HEB>פורשי@ee<ENG> (lit. “shall spread”) means @hh<HEB>פרושי@ee<ENG> (are spread open). [Rashi explains that the term is in the passive form] because the cherubim are not living beings [and cannot spread their wings]. It would have been sufficient for Rashi just to explain that @hh<HEB>פורשי@ee<ENG> means @hh<HEB>פרושי@ee<ENG>. But because @hh<HEB>פורשי@ee<ENG> refers to the [action of the] cherubim, while @hh<HEB>פרושי@ee<ENG> refers to the [state of the] wings, therefore Rashi says: “Do not make @ITtheir wings@it lying” [i.e., in a closed position] — to show that the term refers to the wings. @d1So that there be ten @BItefachim @biin the space.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 [Rashi knows this] because the @ITmishkon@it was one-third the size of the @ITmikdosh,@it which was thirty @ITamohs@it high. The cherubim reached until the top one-third of its height, i.e., ten @ITamohs.@it But the @ITmishkon@it was ten @ITamohs@it high, the equal of sixty @ITtefachim@it. Therefore the cherubim needed to reach until [the top] one-third [the height] of the @ITmishkon@it, i.e., twenty @ITtefachim.@it The ark was one and a half @ITamoh@it or nine @ITtefachim@it high, and the cover was a @ITtefach,@it totaling ten @ITtefachim@it. [The wings were spread and occupied a space of ten @ITtefachim@it above the cover, reaching a height of twenty @ITtefachim@it]. @p1[22]@p2<TIE>The letter @hb<HEB>ו'@BO<ENG> here is superfluous.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo Although [in our Torah scrolls] it is not written @hb<HEB>ו@hhאת@ee<ENG>, in Rashi’s Torah scroll it was written with a @hh<HEB>ו@ee<ENG>, according to [his] Masoretic tradition.<QC>
@p1[27]@p2<TIE>Houses — @BIfor the purpose @biof being receptacles.@d2 I.e., the rings are for the purpose of being receptacles for the poles. @d1As Onkelos translates it: “a place for the poles.”@bo @ITRe”m@it explains that “A place for the poles” means that the rings are to be receptacles, and the receptacles are for the poles — not that the rings are for the receptacles @ITand@it the poles.<QC>
@p1[29]@p2<TIE>It was bent upwards at both ends.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Meaning: the dough was erect at each end, like walls, with space in the middle between them. It was like an upside-down @hh<HEB>ח@ee<ENG>. @d1Lined up with the edge of the @BIshulchan.<TIE>.<TIE>. @biThe showbread was right at the edge of the @ITshulchan,@it so that the thickness of the @ITshulchan@it[’s tabletop] was lined up with the [“face” of the] showbread. And similarly at the other edge. As a result, “It has a ‘face’ ‘looking’ in two directions towards the sides of the House (i.e., @ITmishkon@it).” This was because the length of the table was placed to the width of the @ITmishkon.@it I.e., to the width of the [section of the] Tent of Meeting that was outside the Curtain [of the Holy of Holies]. @d1A golden form and a metal form were made for it.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 [Rashi knows this] because it is written, “Its dishes” (in the plural form), implying there were two dishes. And so with all [the table’s accessories, written in plural]; they all were multiple.<QC>
@d1Were as a covering over it.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Meaning: the half tubes that were inserted between one bread and the other acted as sort of a covering over the bread. Although the verse makes no mention of bread, “By which they shall be covered” refers to that which needs to be covered, i.e., the bread. @p1[31]@p2<TIE>Because Moshe had difficulties with it.@d2 Hashem saw that Moshe had difficulty, therefore He showed him a menorah of fire. But Moshe still had difficulty, so He said, “Throw the mass into the fire.” This was done by Betzalel. Thus in actuality, the menorah was made by itself, although Hashem never expressly told Moshe that it would be made by itself. This is learned from the word @hh<HEB>תיעשה@ee<ENG>, which is written with a @hh<HEB>י@ee<ENG>, rather than @hh<HEB>תעשה@ee<ENG>. @ITRe”m@it elaborates here, but I was brief.<QC>
@p1[37]@p2<TIE>Their shine would be turned towards.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Rashi is saying that the phrases of, “They shine toward it,” and, “Its lamps shall be lit,” do not teach the manner in which the menorah shall be lit because this @ITparshah@it is not speaking about the manner of lighting the menorah but on how it should be constructed. Perforce, the verse is instructing the craftsman to make its lamps in a way that the lamps will shine toward the middle branch once the menorah is lit. This is accomplished by making the mouths of the six lamps, which are on the six branches, turned towards the middle one. (@ITRe”m@it)<QC>
@p1[40]@p2<TIE>The pattern which I show you.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Rashi is explaining that this is an elliptical verse. Scripture should have written: “Observe @ITthe pattern@it @ITwhich I show you,@it and make them like the pattern.<TIE>.<TIE>..” [Rashi knows this] because otherwise, what is the meaning of, “Make them like the pattern”? Scripture never mentioned that Hashem showed Moshe their pattern! Rashi adds, “See here on the mountain,” in order to explain that the verse’s phrase of “On the mountain” refers to the mountain [in general] which Moshe was standing on, not to a specific place on that mountain. Otherwise, [if it referred to a specific place,] the verse would not say, “That will be shown to you @ITon the mountain@it,” which is general, but rather the verse would specify the exact place on the mountain. [If Rashi had said only,] “Here,” it would have implied a specific place. [Therefore Rashi says, “Here @ITon the mountain.@it”] (@ITRe”m@it) @d1Until God showed him a menorah made of fire. @bo@eeHere it is implied that Moshe made the menorah. You might ask: Did not Rashi earlier explain that @hh<HEB>תיעשה@ee<ENG> means it was made by itself? The answer is: Even [when God showed him the menorah, as stated here,] it did not help, and it was made by itself, as Rashi explained above. @p1[1]@p2<TIE>Thus you have four kinds [of material] together in each and every thread.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Explanation: all were entwined [into one thick thread], for it is written, “Twined.” The @hh<HEB>ו@ee<ENG> of @hh<HEB>ותכלת@ee<ENG> has the meaning of @hh<HEB>ב@ee<ENG>. Thus the verse conveys: “Fine linen entwined @ITwith@it greenish blue, dark red, and crimson.” It is like the @hh<HEB>ו@ee<ENG> in @hh<HEB>ה' שלחני @hbו@hhרוחו@ee<ENG> (Yeshaya 48:16), which means: “Hashem sent me @ITwith@it His spirit.” Similarly,@hh<HEB>ה' @hbו@hhכלי זעמו @ee<ENG> (ibid. 13:5), which means: “Hashem @ITwith@it His weapons of wrath.” @d1Which is done through needlework.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 In which the image appearing on both sides is the same.<QC>
@ee@BOA lion on this side and an eagle on the other side.@bo @ITRe”m@it writes: “According to [what Rashi wrote on Yoma 72b], it does not mean specifically ‘a lion on this side and an eagle on the other side.’ It just means various images.<TIE>.<TIE>. However, I do not know why the verse calls these various images ‘cherubim,’ if ‘cherubim’ means images of children. Onkelos translates @hh<HEB>כרובים@ee<ENG> as @hh<HEB>כרביא@ee<ENG>, [‘like children,’] and so Rashi wrote on 25:28, and so it says in Chagigah 13b.” But it seems to me that the @ITmishkon’s@it drapes had only the four images of the Heavenly Chariot: man, lion, ox and eagle, [all of which are referred to as “cherubim”; see Yechezkel 10:20.] Rashi meant specifically “a lion on this side and an eagle on the other side.” @p1[5]@p2<TIE>The loops of one drape [should] line up exactly opposite the loops of the other.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 The loops of one are lined up with the loops of the other, and the clasps join them together.<QC>
@d1Result in the @BIparoches @bibeing a distance of one @BIamoh@bi westward from the clasps.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo@ee Explanation: the @ITparoches@it divided the Holy of Holies from the [remainder of the] @ITOhel Moed,@it and stood ten @ITamohs@it from the west side, equal to the length of the Holy of Holies. Thus, the distance from the @ITparoches@it to the [@ITOhel Moed’s@it entrance in the] east was twenty @ITamohs.@it Now, if the drapes covered the one-@ITamoh@it width of the eastern pillars, and then covered another twenty @ITamohs@it before reaching the @ITparoches@it of the Holy of Holies, then the @ITparoches@it would be one @ITamoh@it distant from the clasps. This is because the clasps were in the middle of the [two groups of] drapes, on the [inner] edge of each twenty-@ITamohs@it-wide group. The drapes would have to cover twenty-one @ITamohs@it [before reaching the @ITparoches@it].<QC>
@p1[9]@p2<TIE>Half of its width hung.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 [Rashi knows this] because it is written (v. 12), “Half of the extra drape shall overlap the back of the @ITmishkon.@it” Accordingly, the other half overlapped the front of the @ITmishkon.@it<QC>
@p1[12]@p2<TIE>Of the planks that remained uncovered.@d2 Rashi does not mean that the uncovered area consisted specifically of the planks. [That cannot be,] because one @ITamoh@it [of the planks] was inserted into the sockets. Rather, the two uncovered @ITamohs@it consisted of an @ITamoh@it of the planks and an @ITamoh@it of the sockets. Furthermore, only according to the @ITBeraisa@it in @ITMaseches Midos@it were there two @ITamohs@it left uncovered. But according to the Gemara in @ITMaseches@it Shabbos, [the first set of drapes] covered nine @ITamohs@it at the back of the @ITmishkon,@it and only the @ITamoh@it of the sockets was uncovered. All views agree that the drapes of goats’ hair covered the sockets also. [Even] according to @ITMaseches@it Shabbos, one @ITamoh@it of the [goats’ hair] drapes must have covered an @ITamoh@it of the [width of the] pillars [at the entrance], and two @ITamohs@it were folded down over the screen of the entrance of the tent. Alternatively: one @ITamoh@it folded down over the screen, and one @ITamoh@it overlapped behind the @ITmishkon,@it lying on the ground.<QC>
@p1[14]@p2<TIE>For the roof made of the drapes of goats’ hairs.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 I.e., the covering went over the roof but not over the sides. [Rashi says this] because even [the covering of] the eleven drapes of goats’ hair is called @hh<HEB>אהל@ee<ENG> (tent), for it is written (v. 7): “Make drapes of goats’ hair for a @hh<HEB>אהל@ee<ENG> over the @ITmishkon.@it” @p1[15]@p2<TIE>From those that were prepared and designated.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Our verse refers to the cedar trees as “planks” because they were designated from the very beginning to become planks. “@ITThe@it planks” means “@ITthe@it [designated] cedars.” @p1[17]@p2<TIE>Were cut out on three of their sides.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 1. The side [of the @ITmishkon’s@it] interior. 2. The side [of the @ITmishkon’s@it] exterior. [These are both sides] of the planks’ thickness. 3. The side of the planks’ width, [facing the adjacent plank. Rashi is not counting the hollow between the pegs]. @d1Their cut away sections should be exactly alike.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo This refers to the three cut sides of the pegs [see previous entry], without [additional] cuts being made in the planks [themselves, as the Ramban suggests]. Therefore it is the pegs, not the planks, that are “parallel to each other.” @d1The other is pulled more to the outside in relation to the thickness of the plank.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 For if so, the planks would not line up straight but would stand slanted.<QC>
@p1[23]@p2<TIE>Against the @BIamoh@bi thickness of the northern and southern @BImishkon@bi planks.@d2 [Rashi knows this] because [the dimensions of the @ITmishkon@it] is derived from the @ITBeis Hamikdash,@it whose width (twenty @ITamohs@it) was one-third of its length (sixty @ITamohs@it). So too with the @ITmishkon@it: its width [ten @ITamohs@it] was one-third of its length (thirty @ITamohs@it). @p1[24]@p2<TIE>The northern and southern sides.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 This is different from the preceding. The other planks were cut away in their width, for beauty’s sake, i.e., so that the sides of the sockets and of the sides of the planks would be even, and not jut out past one another. But for these [corner] planks it was an absolute necessity that they be [cut away] in their width, because it says: “Coupled together on the bottom.” (@ITRe”m@it)<QC>
@d1Whether they were fixed.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 I.e., whether the rings were fixed to one of the planks which were joined together by the rings. @ITNachalas Yaakov@it writes: This is as opposed to the rings into which the bars were inserted, as mentioned in v. 29. Those rings were fixed, as it says in Shabbos 98. @d1The top of the corner plank.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Explanation: the one-@ITamoh@it [thickness of] the last plank [on the northern wall] meets up with the width of the [western wall’s] northernmost plank. And so on the south. Therefore, the ring placed in the thickness of the last plank on the northern wall was inserted into the top of the [northern] corner plank of the western side. And similarly for the southern wall. @d1The plank at the end of the northern side.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 [Rashi knows this] because it is written @hh<HEB>יהיה@ee<ENG>, which is an extra word. Perforce, the phrase of “So must it be done with the two planks” is a separate phrase, and teaches: just as all the planks have two cut-outs on top, for the rings, so shall it be with the two end planks — i.e., the end plank of the northern side, and the adjacent plank of the western side. Similarly, the phrase of “Which are at the corners” is a separate phrase, and teaches that the same is done with @ITboth@it corners: the north-west corner, and the south-west corner. In this manner, all the planks are joined with each other.<QC>
@p1[25]@p2<TIE>The planks were cut out at the bottom.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Explanation: The bottom of the plank was cut out in a way that left intact one-quarter of the [width of the] plank on one side, and the same on the other side. And the cut-out part in the middle was one-half of the [width of the] plank. [Then, the one-quarters on the sides were partially cut out, to form the pegs]. For otherwise, [if Rashi meant to @ITcut away@it one-quarter of the plank on each side, and also to cut away one-half in the middle,] nothing would remain from the width of the plank. And what then does Rashi mean by, “Thereby forming two pegs that were similar to two legs”?<QC>
@p1[26]@p2<TIE>Each section being one fourth.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 [You might ask:] Why did Rashi divide it into three sections, [and say, “Placed at three equidistant places”]? He could have divided it [more simply]: from the top of the plank to the top bar is like from the top bar to the middle bar. And from the middle bar to the bottom bar is like from the bottom bar to the bottom of the plank — thus dividing it into four sections. [The answer is:] Both sides of the top bar are equal. From the top of the plank to the top bar is like from top bar to the middle bar. Therefore, these sides are considered as belonging to the top bar. Similarly, both sides of the middle bar are equal. From the middle bar to the top bar is like from the middle bar to the bottom bar. Therefore, these sides are considered as belonging to the middle bar. Similarly, the sides of the bottom bar are equal. From it to the middle bar is like from it to the bottom. Therefore, they are considered as belonging to it. That is why Rashi divided into three sections and not four. (@ITRe”m@it)<QC>
@p1[29]@p2<TIE>He fastened them near the rings.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Explanation: the cane sections did not cover the rings, but reached from ring to ring. Therefore, each plank needed one [set of] half canes [above and below], since each plank had two rings. @p1[30]@p2<TIE>After it is completed, erect it!@bo I.e., this is a command to Moshe to erect the @ITmishkon@it himself. [Alternatively,] the @ITNachalas Yaakov@it (citing Sifri) says it means: When all the work of the @ITmishkon@it and all its vessels is completed, erect it at one time. Do not erect each part as it is completed, rather, [erect it] all at once. @d1Before this.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Meaning: before it is erected. Hashem had not yet shown it to Moshe, so properly speaking it should say, “.<TIE>.<TIE>.According to its rules as @ITwill be@it shown to you on the mountain.” Nevertheless, the verse is in the past tense form because when the @ITmishkon@it will be erected, He will already have shown it to Moshe on the mountain.<QC>
@p1[32]@p2<TIE>The @BIparoches @biwas ten @BIamohs@bi long.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo @ITRe”m@it writes: I do not know why Rashi places its length along the @ITmishkon’s@it width, and its width along the @ITmishkon’s@it height. Why not the other way around, with its width to the @ITmishkon’s@it width, and its length to [the planks’] length? Furthermore, how can the @ITparoches@it have a long side and a wide side, when it is square? I do not know the place [of Rashi’s source]. @ITNachalas Yaakov@it answers: It seems to me that the long side of the images on the @ITparoches@it was along the @ITmishkon’s@it width. The direction of the images determines what Rashi calls “length.”<QC>
@p1[1]@p2<TIE>It states concerning the inner [altar]: “square”.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 [This interpretation is made] because the word “square” in both places is [extra and is therefore] available for a @ITgezeirah shavah.@it For it is written here, “Five @ITamohs@it long, and five @ITamohs@it wide,” so why does it also say, “Square”? This shows the word is available [for a @ITgezeirah shavah@it]. And it is available there as well. For it is written (30:2), “It shall be one @ITamoh@it long and one @ITamoh@it wide,” so why does it also say, “Square”? This shows that it too is available [for a @ITgezeirah shavah@it]. Since the word is available for a @ITgezeirah shavah@it on both sides, it may be interpreted even contrary to the verse’s plain meaning.<QC>
@p1[3]@p2<TIE>The same as @hb<HEB>כל כליו@BO<ENG>.@d2 Rashi is saying that [despite the @hh<HEB>ל@ee<ENG> of @hh<HEB>לכל@ee<ENG>,] the vessels themselves are to be of copper, not the items needed @ITfor@it the vessels. [Rashi knows this] because there is nothing other than them [i.e., the vessels themselves] mentioned here. The @hh<HEB>ל@ee<ENG> is superfluous; it is [written] for stylistic reasons.<QC>
@p1[5]@p2<TIE>Between the raised projections.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo Meaning: It was a little farther in [toward the altar’s center] than the four projections. @d1For its hollow was filled with earth.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 In order to offer sacrifices upon it.<QC>
@p1[10]@p2<TIE>From one pillar to the next.@bo I.e., [the five @ITamohs@it] include the width of the pillar, which was one @ITamoh.@it You might ask: Since there were twenty pillars, and five @ITamohs@it between pillars, does that not make [nineteen spaces, which is] only ninety-five @ITamohs@it? But in the verse it is written one hundred @ITamohs,@it so five @ITamohs@it are missing! The answer is: The twenty southern pillars and the ten western pillars were set up so that the first western pillar was aligned with the southern pillars. Thus, the southern side actually had twenty-one pillars, with five @ITamohs@it between each pillar, making one hundred @ITamohs@it. And the same setup was on the northern side: the first eastern pillar was aligned with the northern pillars, so that the northern side actually had twenty-one pillars. However, since the corner pillars belonged to the setup of the pillars of the width and not to the length, therefore Scripture wrote [regarding the length]: “It shall have twenty pillars,” and not, “twenty-one pillars.” And so with the pillars of the [western] width: the first northern pillar was aligned with the pillars of the width, so that the width had eleven pillars and ten spaces. And so for all the sides. And [regarding the eastern side:] The enclosure’s entrance was from the fourth pillar to the eighth pillar. It was four pillars. From the first pillar to the fourth were the three pillars [of the flank], because the fourth pillar was part of the four pillars of the entrance. Thus the first flank had three spaces, totaling fifteen @ITamohs@it. From the fourth pillar to the eighth were the four pillars of the entrance, with four spaces, and comprised the twenty @ITamohs@it of the entrance. [It was just four pillars] because the eighth pillar was counted among the three pillars of the second flank. From the eighth pillar to the tenth were three pillars, with three spaces, and comprised the fifteen @ITamohs@it of the second flank. Although three pillars make only two spaces, the tenth pillar did not belong to the pillars of the [southern] length. Thus, there was an extra space between the tenth pillar of the [eastern] width and the first pillar of the [southern] length. This resolves [the difficulties with] Rashi’s explanation. (@ITRe”m@it) In fact, Rashi clearly explains this way (vs. 13-14). See there. @d1 [I.e., the sockets] of the pillars.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 [Rashi is saying that the sockets belonged to the pillars,] not to the curtains. Otherwise, why is it written, “@ITIt@it shall have twenty pillars,” in the singular form, referring to the enclosure, and then say, “And @ITthey@it shall have twenty copper sockets,” in the plural form? Perforce, “they” refers to the just-mentioned pillars. @d1He made a kind of rod.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo I.e., he took a piece of wood and made it into a kind of rod whose length was six @ITtefachim@it. @p1[18]@p2<TIE>The courtyard on the eastern was a square of fifty by fifty @BIamohs.<TIE>.<TIE>. @biRashi is answering the question: “fifty by fifty @ITamohs”@it implies that the courtyard was only fifty @ITamohs@it long, [but Scripture says it was actually one hundred @ITamohs@it long]? He answers: The eastern part of the courtyard, in front of the entrance, was a square area of fifty by fifty @ITamohs@it. @d1Consequently there was a space of twenty @BIamohs.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bi You might ask: The @ITmishkon’s@it interior was thirty by ten @ITamohs,@it and the planks were an @ITamoh@it thick. Does that not leave a space of only nineteen @ITamohs@it behind the @ITmishkon?@it Similarly, the [eastern part of the] of the @ITmishkon’s@it courtyard would not be fifty @ITamohs,@it but forty-nine. Similarly, the northern and southern sides would be only nineteen @ITamohs@it. The answer is: The pillars of the courtyard were an @ITamoh@it thick, which was the same thickness as the @ITmishkon’s@it planks. And the courtyard’s curtains were not hung inside the pillars, but on the outside. Rashi made his calculations based on measuring from the curtains, not from the pillars.<QC>
@p1[19]@p2<TIE>E.g., @hb<HEB>מקבות@BO<ENG>.@bo A sort of hammer. @d1A sort of copper @hb<HEB>נגר@BO<ENG>.@d2 A @hh<HEB>נגר@ee<ENG> is a sort of bar.<QC>
@p1[20]@p2<TIE>Without sediment<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Rashi explains this, lest we ask: How can oil have no sediment? It says in Bava Metzia 40a: R. Yehudah says that even refined oil has one and a half @ITlogim@it of sediment per one hundred @ITlogim@it of oil. This shows there is no oil without sediment. Therefore Rashi explains: “As we have learned .<TIE>.<TIE>. ‘He lets it ripen.<TIE>.<TIE>.’” @d1He lets it ripen on top of the olive tree.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Meaning: he picks the olives growing at the top of the tree, one from here and one from there, because these olives are well ripened and do not have sediment. @d1So that it would not contain sediment<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 When ground in a mill, it has sediment even if “he lets it ripen.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @d1He would put them into a mill and grind them<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Because the more [oil] he extracts from the olives, the more it contains sediment. Therefore, the second oil is unfit because of its sediment.<QC>
@d1But may be used for @BImenachos@BO<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 You might ask: How does Rashi know the second oil may be used for @ITmenachos@it? It is written: “And one-tenth of an @ITeipha@it of fine flour, mixed with one-quarter of a @IThin@it of @ITcrushed@it olive oil” (29:40). Does this not imply that crushed is required [for @ITmenachos@it]? The answer is: Here it should not say, “[crushed] for lighting,” [if it is true that crushed is required in other cases as well]. Perforce, “[crushed] for lighting” is written here to exclude another case: i.e., the oil must be crushed for lighting, but not for @ITmenachos.@it Thus we learn that the second oil may be used for @ITmenachos.@it You might object: Why does it say “crushed” regarding @ITmenachos,@it [if the second oil may be used]? The answer is: Otherwise, we might think that only the [tastier] second oil may be used for @ITmenachos,@it and not the first oil. Therefore it is written “crushed” regarding @ITmenachos,@it to teach that the first oil may also be used. You might object: If so, why does it say here, “crushed for lighting”? Had Scripture omitted this, we still would know [that “crushed” is required for lighting, and not for @ITmenachos@it]. For it is written “crushed” concerning @ITmenachos@it only to teach that crushed, too, may be used for @ITmenachos.@it [We would so understand it] because if [the “crushed” of @ITmenachos@it meant that] @ITonly@it crushed oil may be used for them, but not the second oil, it would not say “crushed” at all for @ITmenachos.@it Then, we would learn from the [“crushed” of the] lighting oil and apply it to @ITmenachos:@it only the crushed oil may be used, not the second oil. [Since it says “crushed” for @ITmenachos,@it perforce it teaches that crushed, too, may be used for them, although it is not as tasty. If so, why does it say, “@ITcrushed@it for lighting”?] The answer is: If “crushed” was not written at all that it may be used for @ITmenachos,@it we would not learn it (that crushed may be used) from the oil of lighting. This is because the two cannot be compared: the oil of lighting is different because it is needed for illumination. Since a wick draws crushed oil better, crushed oil is required [so the lamp will not go out]. But for @ITmenachos,@it [we might think that] only the second oil may be used, since it is sweeter [i.e., tastier]. Therefore, the “crushed” of @ITmenachos@it comes to teach that even crushed oil may be used for them. Accordingly, it says here, “@ITcrushed@it for lighting,” to exclude [@ITmenachos@it from the requirement of crushed oil, since we might think that only the purer crushed oil may be used for them. It teaches] that for @ITmenachos,@it the second oil may also be used. When Rashi says @hh<HEB>כתית למאור ולא כתית למנחות@ee<ENG>, [this does not mean that crushed is unfit for @ITmenachos@it]. It means that crushed is not required for @ITmenachos@it; even ground oil may be used.<QC>
@d1He must kindle it until it.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Rashi is answering the question: Why is it not written @hh<HEB>להדליק@ee<ENG>? [He answers:] It is written @hh<HEB>להעלות@ee<ENG> to teach that the @ITkohein@it should not leave the lamp as soon as it is ignited, while the flame has not yet ascended. [Rather, “He must kindle it until the flame ascends.”] @d1Each and every night may be referred as @HB<HEB>תמיד@BO<ENG>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Rashi is saying that even though it does not burn during the day, only from nightfall until day, it is still called @hh<HEB>תמיד@ee<ENG>. For we see there are other things that are not continuous and unending, yet they are called @hh<HEB>תמיד@ee<ENG>, as Rashi proves. So it is with the “flat-pan @ITmincha,@it” about which it is written @hh<HEB>תמיד@ee<ENG>,@BO@d2 although it is only from day to day, and is divided even during the day itself: “Half was done in the morning and half in the evening” (Vayikra 6:13). Nonetheless, it is called @hh<HEB>תמיד@ee<ENG> because it is ongoing without end. @d1But the @HB<HEB>תמיד@BO<ENG> that is said of the show-bread.@d2 Rashi is saying that the term @hh<HEB>תמיד@ee<ENG> that is stated by the show-bread, etc., is no proof that the term @hh<HEB>תמיד@ee<ENG> can be applied to something that is without end but with breaks. [We might think it is a proof] because the old bread is removed and then the new bread is arranged on the table. [But, this is no proof] because the bread lay on the table continuously from Shabbos to Shabbos. There was no break even when the bread was removed to put the new bread in its place. For as the @ITkohanim@it pulled off [the old bread], other @ITkohanim@it placed [the new bread]; both breads being separated by less than a @ITtefach.@it<QC>
@p1[21]@p2<TIE>Put into it the amount necessary for it to burn.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Rashi is answering the question: The verse seems to say that the amount required for arranging the lamp is from evening to morning, i.e., Aharon should arrange the lamps all night long. If so, when does he kindle them? Therefore Rashi explains: “Put into it the amount necessary for it to burn,” i.e., Aharon should arrange the lamps so they will @ITburn@it from evening to morning — not that he should arrange them from evening to morning. There can be no fixed amount [of oil] because it depends on the wicks. If they are thick, even a whole @ITlog@it will not suffice. [So how did the Sages estimate that the amount of oil is a half a @ITlog?@it] The answer is: Each lamp had a holder for the wick, and the holder allowed only wicks of a certain thickness. (@ITRe”m@it) @p1[1]@p2<TIE>After the work of the @BImishkon @BOis completed.@d2 But not now. [Rashi knows this] because they were taken [as @ITkohanim@it] only by means of the garments and the @ITmishkon,@it as it is written (v. 4): “Make sacred garments for your brother Aharon.<TIE>.<TIE>.” [See Rashi on v. 3.] (@ITRe”m@it)<QC>
@p1[3]@p2<TIE>The term @HB<HEB>כהונה@BO<ENG> denoting “service.”@d2 Accordingly, @hh<HEB>לכהנו@ee<ENG> does not mean to make him a @ITkohein,@it but “to bring him into the service by means of the garments.” Rashi added the phrase, “So that he shall be a @hh<HEB>כהן@ee<ENG> unto Me,” in order to connect @hh<HEB>לכהנו@ee<ENG> with @hh<HEB>לי@ee<ENG>. Rashi did not comment on @hh<HEB>לכהנו לי@ee<ENG> in v. 1, where it first appeared, because he wanted to explain @hh<HEB>לקדשו@ee<ENG>, and say that it means @hh<HEB>לכהנו@ee<ENG>. Accordingly, our verse conveys: and how should Aharon be sanctified (@hh<HEB>לקדשו@ee<ENG>)? By bringing him into the service (@hh<HEB>לכהנו@ee<ENG>).<QC>
@p1[4]@p2<TIE>It is thus made for the lower.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 I.e., toward his feet, and not toward his head. Rashi’s explanation, “Its width being @ITthe same as@it the width of the back of a man,” should not be to be taken literally, because Rashi explains in v. 6 that its width was “somewhat more” on each side. @d1We learn from this that the @BIeiphod @BOis a kind of belt.@d2 I.e., that the @ITeiphod@it is a garment [which is belted on]. @d1“And he put the @BIeiphod @BOon it”.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 I.e., on the coat, as we see later. @BOBecause it adorns him and ornaments him.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Rashi is saying that @ITeiphod@it means an ornament. [Here,] it adorns the @ITkohein.@it The term @hh<HEB>חֵשֶב@ee<ENG> that is written dealing with the priestly garments means a belt.<QC>
@d1While he likewise translated @HB<HEB>מעילים@BO<ENG> (robes).<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Robes are surely a garment. So the @ITeiphod,@it too, is a garment. @d1This was a type of shirt.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Rashi is referring to the word @hh<HEB>מעיל@ee<ENG> in the verse, and explains it. @d1A kind of a domed hat.@d2 Rashi is explaining that we should not think @hh<HEB>מצנפת@ee<ENG> is what is called @IThoiben@it in Yiddish, which lies flat on the head. For a @IThoiben@it does not have a dome. The verse’s @hh<HEB>מצנפת@ee<ENG> is rather a type of hat that is hard, with a dome-like space inside. @d1Which Onkelos translates for us as “hats.”@d2 Rashi is saying that the @hh<HEB>מגבעת@ee<ENG> of ordinary @ITkohanim@it is also a @hh<HEB>מצנפת@ee<ENG>, as it says in Yoma 25a: “The appointee took the @hh<HEB>מצנפת@ee<ENG> off one of the @ITkohanim.@it<TIE>.<TIE>.” Thus we see that @hh<HEB>מצנפת@ee<ENG> is called @hh<HEB>מגבעת@ee<ENG> for ordinary @ITkohanim,@it and [here] it says @hh<HEB>מצנפת@ee<ENG> in place of @hh<HEB>מגבעת@ee<ENG>. Since @hh<HEB>מצנפת@ee<ENG> means @hh<HEB>מגבעת@ee<ENG>, and Onkelos translates @hh<HEB>מגבעות@ee<ENG> as “hats,” it follows that @hh<HEB>מצנפת@ee<ENG> is a kind of hat. Sometimes it is called @hh<HEB>מצנפת@ee<ENG> because it wraps the head like a @hh<HEB>צניף@ee<ENG> (turban), and sometimes [i.e., for the ordinary @ITkohanim@it] it is called @hh<HEB>מגבעת@ee<ENG> because it covers their [whole] head like a hat, [however, the @hh<HEB>מצנפת@ee<ENG> of the @ITKohein@it @ITGadol@it was smaller, in order to leave room for the @hh<HEB>ציץ@ee<ENG>]. (@ITRe”m@it) @d1From the @BIterumah @BOthat was sanctified for My Name.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Rashi is answering the question: The term “sacred garments” implies that the garments are sacred as soon as they are made. But they are not sacred until they are worn, because they are made for Aharon and his sons, [not for Hashem]!? Rashi answers, “From the @ITterumah.<TIE>.<TIE>.@it” [I.e., they are called “sacred” because they are made from the funds of @ITterumah@it which was collected from the people for the sake of Hashem, so they became sacred immediately]. @p1[5]@p2<TIE>Shall receive from the donors.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Rashi is explaining that the pronoun “they” does not refer to “Aharon and his sons,” mentioned immediately before, but to the “wise at heart” in v. 3. The word @hh<HEB>יקחו@ee<ENG> [usually] conveys legal acquisition, which is unrelated to craftsmanship and the artisans who perform their work. Therefore Rashi explains that here, @hh<HEB>יקחו@ee<ENG> means “they shall receive” the materials in order to make the garments. And because there is no receiver without one who gives, Rashi adds: “From the donors the gold.<TIE>.<TIE>.”<QC>
@p1[6]@p2<TIE>The settings were put in their ends in front of his shoulders.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 I.e., the settings were put on the shoulder-straps in the place where the @ITshoham-@itstones were fixed. @d1Similarly the two ends of the chain.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Explanation: These are the golden braided chains. After they are inserted in the rings [of the breastplate], each chain has two heads; they are thus double. [They are attached to] the settings of the @ITeiphod,@it which are actually the settings on the shoulder straps [of the @ITeiphod.@it They are so called] because everything connected to the @ITeiphod@it is called @IT“eiphod” —@it and the shoulder straps are connected to the belt of the @ITeiphod.@it<QC>
@d1Lying on each other.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Explanation: The rings of the shoulder straps were on the outside and the rings of the breastplate were on the inside. He then @hh<HEB>מרכסן@ee<ENG>, i.e., joins them with a thread of greenish-blue wool, so the breastplate will not move about and separate.<QC>
@p1[10]@p2<TIE>In the order that they were born.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Rashi is explaining that we should not understand @hh<HEB>כתולדותם@ee<ENG> like other instances of @hh<HEB>תולדות@ee<ENG> in Scripture, i.e., [listing in the order of] who begat first, or whose number of offspring [is greater]. Therefore Rashi says that here, @hh<HEB>כתולדותם@ee<ENG> means: “In the order that they were born.” @p1[11]@p2<TIE>The work of one skilled with stones.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Rashi is explaining that @hh<HEB>חרש@ee<ENG> is connected to @hh<HEB>אבן@ee<ENG>, so that @hh<HEB>חרש@ee<ENG> means “one skilled with stones.” Rashi says “stones” instead of “stone” [as in the verse], to tell us that “stone” means the category of stones, not a particular stone. [Rashi knows this] because one is not called skilled [by being skilled] with just a single stone. @d1@HB<HEB>כגלף דעזקא@BO<ENG> (like the engraving of a signet).<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 @hh<HEB>כגלף@ee<ENG> means “like the engraving,” and @hh<HEB>עזקא@ee<ENG> is a signet ring. Rashi is telling us that @hh<HEB>פתוחי חותם@ee<ENG> means the engraving on a ring used for making seals, [not the seal that it makes. Rashi knows this] because engraving is done on the ring itself, not on the seal. He says, “@ITLike@it the engraving,” so we will not think it means to carve the engravings of an actual signet ring into the stones. It rather means to carve writing that is “precise,” similar to the letters carved into a signet ring which are obvious and precise. So too should be the names of the Bnei Yisrael that are carved into the stones. @d1Same here as @HB<HEB>בשמות@BO<ENG>.@d2 Meaning: engrave the stones with names. [Rashi explains this] because the stones are not engraved on the names [as the verse seems to say, but the other way around]. @d1By gold settings.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Meaning: the verse conveys that the stones are “surrounded by settings,” not that the stones surround the settings [as the verse seems to say].<QC>
@p1[12]@p2<TIE>The tribes written before Him.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 [Meaning:] not that Aharon should bear them in order to remember Hashem. This is because the engraved names make the tribes to be remembered, not Hashem to be remembered. Why did Rashi not explain this on, “As remembrance stones for the B’nei Yisrael”? Because there, “remembrance” is connected to “stones.” But here it is written, “Their names before @ITAdonoy.@it<TIE>.<TIE>. as a remembrance,” which implies that God will remember.<TIE>.<TIE>. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1[13]@p2<TIE>Only part of their purpose.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 I.e., for the chains should be inserted in them. But it does not explain here that the ends of the chains should be inserted in the settings on the two shoulder straps of the @ITeiphod@it from above. And that these chains should be inserted through the rings of the breastplate from below, so that the breastplate does not detach from the @ITeiphod.@it (@ITRe”m@it) @p1[14]@p2<TIE>Made for wells.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 To draw water. @d1Rather, like those made for incense receptacles.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 They are sacks tied onto a small rope.<QC>
@p1[15]@p2<TIE>Its promise is true.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Meaning: anything that one was not sure whether or not to do, would go to [and inquire from] the breastplate, which had all the letters of the @ITalef beis. @itIf Heaven wished to tell him to do it, letters would stand out and form a word. In that word was written whether or not to do it. @d1Here it is used in the sense of making its words clear.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Meaning: @hh<HEB>משפט@ee<ENG> conveys three possibilities, one of which is “the handing down of the verdict.” The term @hh<HEB>משפט@ee<ENG> which is part of the name given to the breastplate refers to “the handing down of the verdict,” i.e., clarifying the matter.<QC>
@p1[21]@p2<TIE>As was the order of their birth so was the order of the stones.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 I.e., it was in the order by which the matriarchs [started to] give birth. Whoever gave birth first, [@ITall@it her sons came before those of the next matriarch]. This disregards the order that the tribes were actually born — Reuvain, Shimon, Leivi, Yehudah, [Dan, Naftali] — as the @hh<HEB>תולדותם@ee<ENG> of the @ITeiphod@it is ordered. Therefore here, Yissachar and Zevulun [who are sons of Leah, the first matriarch to give birth,] come before Dan and Naftali. As a result, Dan’s name was written on the @ITleshem@it stone, as it is written in Yehoshua (19:47): “They called [the town of] Leshem ‘Dan,’ like the name of Dan their father” [see Rashi on Shoftim 18:29]. @ITRe”m@it elaborated, and I summarized. @p1[22]@p2<TIE>To fasten them by means of its rings.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 [Rashi explains that @hh<HEB>על החשן@ee<ENG> means “@ITfor@it the breastplate”] so we will not think that they [the chains] must be made @ITon@it the breastplate, and may not be made elsewhere and then attached. For as Rashi explains on v. 23, [they are made elsewhere and then they are attached].<QC>
@d1Is the same as “chain” in Mishnaic Hebrew.@d2 Accordingly, it means to make chains that will serve as “roots.” @p1[23]@p2<TIE>We should have written at the beginning.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Perforce, it means “@ITfor@it the breastplate,” and “you must also interpret it this way regarding the chains.”<QC>
@p1[24]@p2<TIE>In @BIparshas @BOPekudei they are not mentioned twice.@d2 I.e., in the section of the breastplate, the @hh<HEB>עבותות@ee<ENG> are not mentioned, [only the @hh<HEB>שרשרות@ee<ENG>]. @p1[25]@p2<TIE>Of the @BIeiphod.<TIE>.<TIE>. @bo@itAs opposed to “toward the robe.” [Rashi knows this because if “Toward its face” meant toward the face of the @ITkohein,@it what would it be as opposed to? The shoulder-straps of the @ITeiphod@it are necessarily toward the face of the @ITkohein@it who wears them.] @p1[27]@p2<TIE>Where it is attached to the @BIeiphod.<TIE>.<TIE>.@BO@d2 I.e., to the belt of the @ITeiphod.@it<QC>
@d1Above the belt.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Explanation: the shoulder straps were joined along their width to the belt, and the rings were placed above their [point of joining], right at the [upper] edge of the belt. Consequently, the bottom of the breastplate, [which was tied to the rings,] reached the top of the belt. [Rashi knows this] because it says, “Above the @ITeiphod’s@it belt.”<QC>
@p1[31]@p2<TIE>Put on over it as a wrap around.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 [Rashi knows this] because otherwise, a question arises: The robe and the @ITeiphod@it are two different garments. Why then is it written, “The robe of the @ITeiphod,@it” implying it is one garment? @p1[32]@p2<TIE>So that it will not be torn.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Rashi is saying that in the verse’s plain meaning, @hh<HEB>לא יקרע@ee<ENG> comes to explain what preceded it. [I.e., its opening should have a border @ITso that@it it will not tear@IT.@it] However, since it does not say @hb<HEB>ש@hhלא יקרע@ee<ENG>, we may infer that it is a negative precept on its own. In all the cases that Rashi brings, the proof is the same, [i.e., it does not say @hb<HEB>ש@hhלא@ee<ENG>.]<QC>
@p1[35]@p2<TIE>Subject to the death penalty at the hands of Heaven.@d2 Rashi is telling us that the verse does not come to teach that he will not die; rather, it teaches that this negative precept bears the death penalty. [Rashi is further telling us] that “So that he will not die” applies to all the priestly garments, not just to the robe of the @ITeiphod@it which preceded this warning. When Rashi says, “While lacking one of these garments,” he means any of the aforementioned garments. In Zevachim 17b, this law is derived from the verse, “And the priesthood [i.e., the garments] shall be for them an everlasting statute” (29:9), [which is interpreted to mean:] “When their garments are upon them, their priesthood is upon them. When their garments are not upon them, their priesthood is not upon them.” Thus they are subject to the death penalty, since a non-@ITkohein@it who serves is subject to the death penalty (Sanhedrin 9:6). See more on this in @ITRe”m.@it @p1[37]@p2<TIE>At these three places.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Since the threads were inserted through holes, each was doubled, and three threads became six. The middle thread was in the middle of the diadem. One of its strands was on top of the diadem, on the outside, and the other strand was under the diadem, opposite the first thread. Therefore it says here, “Set it @ITon@it a greenish-blue cord,” but elsewhere it says, “Put @ITover@it it a greenish-blue cord.” The middle thread holds it so it does not fall; otherwise it would slip downward. @p1[40]@p2<TIE>These four garments and no more.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Rashi is saying that it does not mean we should make an undershirt, sash-belt, turban and pants only for Aharon’s sons, and not for Aharon himself. [This is not so] because these garments were made for Aharon as well. Rather, it means that among Aharon’s eight garments, these four should also be made [for his sons]. @p1[41]@p2<TIE>Those that are mentioned regarding Aharon.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Not only the undershirt, turban and sash-belt written just before this.<QC>
@d1Mentioned later concerning all of them.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 I.e., [the verse about] pants refers both to the @ITKohein Gadol@it and to ordinary @ITkohanim.@it @d1Those that are mentioned in connection with them.@d2 Which are: the undershirt, turban and sash-belt, along with the later-mentioned pants. @d1Aharon and his sons.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Rashi is coming to tell us that [this term @hh<HEB>אותם@ee<ENG>] does not refer to the garments, as does the term @hh<HEB>אותם@ee<ENG> at the beginning of the verse. Rashi says, “With the @ITanointing@it oil,” to tell us that it does not mean with olive oil or something else. [Rashi knows this] because it is written in the next section: “Take the garments.<TIE>.<TIE>. and take the @ITanointing@it oil, etc.” (29:5-7). @d1And that is the expression of filling the hand.@d2 Explanation: When one’s hand fills a glove it acts as a sign that he has control over that to which he has been appointed. This is because a person has control over that which he holds in his hand. And holding on with a full hand gives one more control than holding it with only part of his hand. Therefore, he who takes control over something does so by “filling the hand.” @p1[43]@p2<TIE>Into the Sanctuary as well as into the @BImishkon.@BO@d2 [@ITGur Aryeh@it:] I.e., when the Temple will be built, the term “Tent of Meeting” will refer to the Sanctuary. [@ITRe”m@it:] The term “Tent of Meeting” refers only to the @ITmishkon.@it However, the Sanctuary is learned from the @ITmishkon@it by @ITkal vachomer.@it (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it:) This is not so, for it says clearly in Shavuos 16: “If it said @ITmishkon@it and did not say @ITmikdosh,@it I would say.<TIE>.<TIE>. And if it said @ITmikdosh@it and did not say @ITmishkon,@it I would say.<TIE>.<TIE>.” This implies that we cannot learn one from the other either by @ITkal vachomer@it or by @ITbameh matzinu.@it Therefore, it seems that Rashi learned [the law of the Sanctuary] from what the Toras Kohanim in @ITparshas@it Shemini says about [the prohibition of drinking] wine [before entering] in the Tent of Meeting: “I know only for the Tent of Meeting [in the desert, that it is prohibited]. From where do I know that it applies also to [the @ITmishkon@it in] Shiloh, and to the permanent @ITbeis hamidkash@it? Thus it says, ‘An everlasting statute.’” This is what Rashi meant when he wrote here: “‘An everlasting statute for him’.<TIE>.<TIE>. it is a decree for the immediate present and for future generations.”<QC>
@d1One who performs.<TIE>.<TIE>. lacking any of the garments [is liable to] the death penalty.@d2 [This verse is needed] because @hh<HEB>ולא ימות@ee<ENG> (28:35) teaches only about the six garments that preceded it, not about the pants and the diadem that follows it. Question: why were these two garments not written earlier, and included with the others, so that @hh<HEB>ולא ימות@ee<ENG> would apply to them all? And then, our verse @hh<HEB>ולא ישאו עון ומתו@ee<ENG> could have been omitted. Perhaps the answer is: [Our verse is needed] so we will not think that the @ITkohein@it is liable only when he has all eight garments, and serves without wearing them all. But if he does not have all eight, for example, if they were lost or defiled, we might think that he may serve with the remaining garments, in order that the @ITkorbon@it will not be suspended due to lack of garments. Thus it repeats here @hh<HEB>ומתו@ee<ENG> to teach that one who serves while lacking garments [for whatever reason] is liable for the death penalty. @p1[1]@p2<TIE>They are of two different @HB<HEB>גִזְרוֹת@BO<ENG>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 I.e., two different word roots. One is @hh<HEB>קיחה@ee<ENG> and the other is @hh<HEB>לקיחה@ee<ENG>. @d1To atone for the act of the calf.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Rashi is answering the question: Why is a bull taken, and not another type of animal? [Rashi answers as he does] because “bull” means the same as “calf” whenever it is not written “less than a year old” [for the calf. Question: How can a bull be used for this purpose?] An accuser cannot become a defender. @ITRe”m@it answers: That rule applies only to service done inside [the @ITohel moed@it], not to service done outside [in its courtyard]. Later, in @ITparshas@it Tzav, I will explain this further, God willing. @p1[2]@p2<TIE>Is referred to later on.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Rashi wishes to prove that the “unleavened bread” mentioned here is actually “scalded dough.” The term “bread” comprises all types, so Rashi explains that here, “bread” means “scalded dough.” His proof is from (Vayikra 6:13), “This is the offering of @ITAharon and his sons.@it<TIE>.<TIE>. on the day that @IThe@it is anointed.” [This verse raises a question:] What does, “The day that @IThe@it is anointed,” teach us regarding his sons? [The answer is:] The installation of an ordinary @ITkohein@it into his service, in all generations, is being compared to the @ITKohein Gadol’s@it daily offering@IT.@it This offering is called @ITchavisin,@it and is of “scalded dough” — as it is written, “You shall bring it well scalded in boiling water” (ibid. v. 14). Therefore, on the day of installation of Aharon’s sons, who are ordinary @ITkohanim,@it there is an offering is of “scalded dough.” [See Menachos 78a and Rashi there.] The “scalded dough” is bread whose dough is completely scalded in boiling water, then baked in an oven, and then fried in a pan. The “loaves” and “wafers” are only baked in an oven. The “loaves” are mixed with oil while still flour. The “wafers” are first baked and then anointed with oil in the shape of the Greek letter @ITchi,@it and the rest of their oil is consumed by the @ITkohanim.@it Some say that the wafers are repeatedly anointed until the whole @ITlog@it of oil is used up. (@ITRe”m@it) @d1Brought of each kind.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 [The number ten] is learned from the number of loaves of the thanksgiving offering: just as there are ten loaves there, so too here. It is clear that the thanksgiving offering has ten loaves [of each kind of bread], because it is written about its bread: “From it, he shall bring one from each offering as @ITterumah@it” (Vayikra 7:14). And the Gemora in Menachos 78b interprets as follows: It says @ITterumah@it here, [regarding the bread of the thanksgiving offering,] and it says @ITterumah@it there, [in Bamidbar 18:26,] regarding @ITterumas ma’aser.@it Just as there, it is one from ten, so too here, one from ten [is brought as @ITterumah.@it Thus we learn that the bread of the thanksgiving offering has ten loaves of each kind.] @d1While they were still flour, oil was poured into them.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Rashi is answering the question: Why does Scripture describe each differently, rather than saying “mixed” or “anointed” for all of them? @p1[3]@p2<TIE>To the courtyard of the @BImishkon.<TIE>.<TIE>. @bo@itBut not to the altar. [Rashi knows this] because only one of every kind was actually offered up, as it is written below in vs. 23-25. Rashi adds, “On the day when it will be erected,” to say that it should be done then, and not beforehand. The @ITmishkon@it was actually erected only on @ITrosh chodesh@it Nissan, because during the [preceding] seven days of installation, Moshe built and dismantled it every day. @p1[4]@p2<TIE>This is immersing the entire body.@d2 And not sanctification of the hands and feet. [Rashi knows this] because it is written @hh<HEB>בַמים@ee<ENG> (@ITthe@it water), implying the water known from elsewhere. This is @ITmikveh@it water, which contains forty @ITse’ah.@it Consequently, it means immersing the body. @p1[7]@p2<TIE>He puts oil on his head.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 I.e., a drop of oil.<QC>
@p1[9]@p2<TIE>This procedure of installation.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Question: In Zevachim 17 and Sanhedrin 28 this verse is interpreted to mean that they acquire priesthood by wearing the garments, [and the wearing of garments is apparently not referring to the installation procedure]: when their garments are upon them, their priesthood is upon them. And when their garments are not upon them, their priesthood is not upon them and they are like non-@ITkohanim.@it [Why does Rashi explain it as referring to the installation procedure?] The answer is: We already learned from, “These garments must be worn by Aharon and his sons” (28:43), that if they lack one of the priestly garments [and perform the service,] they are liable for the death penalty [since they are like non-@ITkohanim;@it see 28:35]. Therefore, Rashi holds that we must explain our verse here according to its plain meaning, not according to its Halachic exegesis [as it is interpreted in the Gemara]. Otherwise, the prohibition to serve without priestly garments would seem to be written twice. @d1By means of these things.@d2 I.e., by means of the things written afterward: “Bring.<TIE>.<TIE>. Slaughter .<TIE>.<TIE>.” [Rashi is explaining that] the installation procedure is not a separate matter from the things written afterward. @d1Installation and the appointment to the priesthood.@d2 Since @hh<HEB>מילוי ידים@ee<ENG> always means installation, Rashi tells us to what they were installed.<QC>
@p1[11]@p2<TIE>In the courtyard of the @BImishkon.<TIE>.<TIE>. @bo@itAs stated in @ITparshas@it Tzav. It does not mean literally in the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, since sin offerings were slaughtered north of the altar, [while the Tent’s entrance was to the west]. The verse rather means “opposite the entrance.” @p1[12]@p2<TIE>At the top, actually on the “horns.”@d2 Explanation: He may not do as with the burnt offering and all the other sacrifices, standing below [on the ground] and casting the blood onto the lower half of the altar’s wall below the horns [which protruded from its upper corners]. @d1The @BIremaining @BOblood.@d2 [Rashi knows this] because he puts blood also on the horns. If so, how does it say, “Pour @ITall@it the blood”? Perforce, it conveys: “All the @ITremaining@it blood.” @p1[13]@p2<TIE>Also take some of the liver.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 [Rashi knows this] because it is written in Vayikra 9:10: “The lobe @ITfrom@it the liver,” implying he should take a bit of the liver along with the lobe. In our verse, @hh<HEB>על הכבד@ee<ENG> means @hh<HEB>עם הכבד@ee<ENG> i.e., @ITwith@it the liver. @p1[14]@p2<TIE>We find no other “outside” sin-offering.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Question: Is there not another “outside” sinoffering that was burnt, namely, the calf sinoffering of Vayikra 9:11? The answer is: Rashi means that there is no other besides those of the installation procedure. The calf sin-offering was also part of the installation procedure, as it was the beginning of Aharon’s installation as @ITKohein Gadol.@it [It was the first sacrifice that Aharon himself offered.] Thus, “No other.<TIE>.<TIE>. besides this one” is not to be taken literally. It means: “no other besides this one and those similar to it.” @p1[16]@p2<TIE>With a vessel. He holds the basin.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 [Rashi knows this because] if we think it means [to put the blood] with his finger, we should note that it says @hh<HEB>וזרקת@ee<ENG> [literally: “You shall throw”]. How is this done? Perforce, “He holds the basin.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @d1But other @BIkorbonos..@BO.@d2 Including this one.<QC>
@p1[17]@p2<TIE>With its cut up pieces.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 [Rashi says,@BO@d2 “In addition to the @ITother@it pieces,”] rather than, “In addition to the pieces,” because the intestines and legs are among its pieces. That which Rashi said before — “With its cut up pieces” — seemingly implied that the intestines and legs are not among its pieces. Therefore Rashi writes [in clarification], “In addition to the @ITother@it pieces.” We need not ask: How does Rashi know that @hh<HEB>על@ee<ENG> means “with”? Perhaps it means literally [“on”]. For the answer is: It is written @hh<HEB>על נתחיו ועל ראשו@ee<ENG>. This raises a question: if the intestines and legs are “on” the pieces, how can they be “on” the head? And if they are “on” the head, how can they be “on” the pieces? Therefore Rashi explains, “@ITWith@it its cut up pieces.” @p1[18]@p2<TIE>“It is pleasing to Me.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Not that the fragrance itself is pleasing to Him. [Rashi knows this] because it is written (Tehillim 50:12): “If I was hungry I would not tell you [to feed me], for Mine is the world and its fullness.” [Alternatively], Rashi is answering the question: Does not the burning of meat and bones produce a terrible odor? Therefore he explains, “It is pleasing to Me.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (@ITDevek Tov@it)<QC>
@d1From the word @HB<HEB>אש@BO<ENG>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 @hh<HEB>אשה@ee<ENG> is an adjective describing @hh<HEB>עולה@ee<ENG>. It is so described because all the limbs of the @hh<HEB>עולה@ee<ENG> are put in fire. @p1[20]@p2<TIE>[@HB<HEB>בהן@BO<ENG> means:] “the thumb” — and on the middle joint.@d2 [Rashi knows it is the middle joint] because it is similar to the @hh<HEB>תנוך@ee<ENG>, which is in the middle of the ear.<QC>
@p1[22]@p2<TIE>This refers to the fat of the small intestines.@d2 R. Akiva and R. Yishmael disagree over this: one says it is the fat of the small intestines, and one says it is the fat of the stomach. @d1With the other parts to be burnt.@d2 Nor do we find anywhere that the @ITterumah@it separated from the bread of a @hh<HEB>שלמים@ee<ENG> sacrifice is burnt, like this one is burnt. The @ITterumah@it is always given to the @ITkohanim.@it Here however, it was a temporary injunction. @d1It is “perfect” in every way. Scripture thereby teaches.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Explanation: The @hh<HEB>מלואים@ee<ENG> written here is the same as @hh<HEB>שלמים@ee<ENG> written elsewhere. It is called @hh<HEB>מלואים@ee<ENG> because anything that is @hh<HEB>מלא@ee<ENG> (full and complete) is @hh<HEB>שלם@ee<ENG> (perfect). That is why @hh<HEB>שלמים@ee<ENG> is called as it is. @hh<HEB>שלמים@ee<ENG> means complete in every way. Here the verse uses the term @hh<HEB>מלואים@ee<ENG>, rather than the usual @hh<HEB>שלמים@ee<ENG>, because “Scripture thereby teaches that the completion-offerings were @hh<HEB>שלמים@ee<ENG> sacrifices.” In other words, [it teaches that @hh<HEB>שלמים@ee<ENG>] are completed and filled in every way: “They bring about peace to the altar, and to the one who performs the service and to the ‘owners’.” @p1[23]@p2<TIE>From the scalded kind.@d2 [Rashi knows this] because it is written, “Loaf of oiled bread,” indicating that much oil is put in it. This is the “scalded dough,” for its amount of oil equals that of the loaves and wafers together. @p1[24]@p2<TIE>Both participated in the waving.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 [Rashi knows this] because it is written, “Place all these things upon the hands of Aharon.<TIE>.<TIE>. and you shall wave them.” If they are on Aharon’s hands, how could Moshe wave them? Yet it is written, “@ITYou@it shall wave them.” Perforce, they both waved. @d1He brings it back and forth.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 [Rashi knows this] because @hh<HEB>תנופה@ee<ENG> means waving. Whereas bringing it up and down is learned from @hh<HEB>ואשר הורם@ee<ENG> (v. 27), since @hh<HEB>הרמה@ee<ENG> is upwards. And one cannot bring up without lowering [afterward, thus we learn bringing it down as well]. @p1[25]@p2<TIE>After the earlier ram.@d2 Rashi is saying that the burning of the parts to be burnt from the @hh<HEB>שלמים@ee<ENG> sacrifice came @ITafter@it the placing of the burnt offering on the altar. I.e., we should not think that @hh<HEB>על העולה@ee<ENG> means to place the parts to be burnt from the @hh<HEB>שלמים@ee<ENG> sacrifice, with its shoulder and loaves, on top of the burnt offering and burn them all together.<QC>
@p1[27]@p2<TIE>And the waving of the breast and shoulder.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 [Rashi is explaining that] it does not mean to sanctify the actual breast and shoulder spoken of here. [Rashi knows this because] they were already waved and uplifted. Then the shoulder was burnt and the breast was given to Moshe as a portion, and they have no further level of sanctity. Perforce, [“Sanctify the breast.<TIE>.<TIE>. and the shoulder.<TIE>.<TIE>.”] was written for generations, as Rashi explains: “That there will continue to be practiced the uplifting and the waving of the breast and shoulder of the @hh<HEB>שלמים@ee<ENG> offerings. However, not insofar as burning them is concerned, but instead: ‘They shall be Aharon’s.<TIE>.<TIE>.’”<QC>
@p1[29]@p2<TIE>Whoever follows him in his exalted position.@d2 I.e., to be @ITKohein Gadol@it in his place, for an ordinary @ITkohein@it is forbidden to wear the @ITKohein Gadol’s@it eight garments. @d1To be put in a high position by them.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 [Rashi knows this] because @hh<HEB>משיחה@ee<ENG> [in its usual sense of “anointing”] does not apply to garments. Anointing is not done with garments [but with oil]. @d1By means of the garments.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 [Rashi knows this] because it is written (v. 9): “Gird them.<TIE>.<TIE>. and bind turban-like hats for them and then the priesthood shall be for them an everlasting statute.” But if their garments are not upon them, they are like non-@ITkohanim.@it @p1[30]@p2<TIE>[They must be] consecutive.@d2 [Rashi knows this] because otherwise, why does it say “seven days”? A @ITKohein Gadol@it must wear these garments @ITevery@it time he serves, after which he removes them [until the next time]. Perforce, it refers to his seven days of installation — which are consecutive. @d1One of his sons who will rise up in his place.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Rashi is telling us that [@hh<HEB>תחתיו מבניו@ee<ENG>] should be understood in reverse order, as @hh<HEB>מבניו תחתיו@ee<ENG>, thus meaning: “He who serves@IT — @itone of his sons — who will rise up in his place to the high priesthood.”<QC>
@d1Prepared to enter the innermost part.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 See Yoma 73a. Perforce, it means “the innermost part.” This is because the “Tent of Meeting” mentioned here cannot refer to the @ITmishkon,@it like it does everywhere else in the Torah, since every@IT kohein@it is fit to enter the @ITmishkon.@it So Scripture would not identify [a specific @ITkohein@it] by saying one who is fit to enter the Tent of Meeting. Perforce, “Tent of Meeting” refers to “the innermost part.” @ITRe”m@it [who did not understand why Rashi said this,] overlooked the above Gemora. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @d1Who can fill his position.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 [Rashi knows this] because in Vayikra 16:32 it is written @hh<HEB>ואשר @hhימלא@hh את ידו@ee<ENG>, which teaches: when he can fill (@hh<HEB>ממלא@ee<ENG>) his father’s place, [he should be appointed]. @d1A participle — the one actually doing service.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 This is because the term @hh<HEB>הכהן@ee<ENG> must be connected to @hh<HEB>תחתיו מבניו@ee<ENG>. For if it is connected to @hh<HEB>ילבשם@ee<ENG>, and means, “The priest shall wear them,” then @hh<HEB>תחתיו@ee<ENG> would be without meaning. i.e., it would not be referring to anything. But since @hh<HEB>הכהן@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>תחתיו@ee<ENG> are connected, this shows that [regarding Aharon and his sons,] the term @hh<HEB>כהן@ee<ENG> is “a participle — the one actually doing service.” For if the term @hh<HEB>כהן@ee<ENG> mentioned here means someone with a prominent position, as in the following verses — @hh<HEB>מדין@ee<ENG> @hh<HEB>כהן@ee<ENG> (2:16), @hh<HEB>כהן און@ee<ENG> (Bereishis 41:45), @hh<HEB>בני דוד כהנים@ee<ENG> (Shmuel II 8:18) — @hh<HEB>תחתיו@ee<ENG> would not follow it. It is not idiomatic to say @hh<HEB>המלך תחתיו@ee<ENG>, or @hh<HEB>השר תחתיו@ee<ENG>, but rather @hh<HEB>המלך אשר יהיה תחתיו@ee<ENG>, or @hh<HEB>ימלוך תחתיו@ee<ENG>. Therefore, [if @hh<HEB>הכהן@ee<ENG> meant someone with the prominent position of “priest,”] the verse would be elliptic. [However, if @hh<HEB>הכהן@ee<ENG> means “the one actually doing service,” and it is as if it said @hh<HEB>המשרת@ee<ENG>, then @hh<HEB>הכהן@ee<ENG> connects smoothly with [the next word,] @hh<HEB>תחתיו@ee<ENG>. Therefore Rashi says: “It is for this reason that the mark of the intonation is a @hh<HEB>תביר@ee<ENG>, which connects it to the next word,” and not to the preceding word @hh<HEB>ילבשם@ee<ENG>. This is because a @hh<HEB>תביר@ee<ENG> does not [necessarily] connect to [the preceding mark of] @hh<HEB>דרגא@ee<ENG>. See @ITKitzur Mizrachi.@it @p1[31]@p2<TIE>In the courtyard of the Tent of Meeting.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 [Rashi knows this] because it is written in Vayikra 6:9, “In a sacred place; in the courtyard of the Tent of Meeting.” @d1 These @BIshlomim @BOwere Holy of Holies.@d2 [Rashi knows they were not like regular @ITshlomim@it] because otherwise, why does it say, “A non-@ITkohein@it may not eat thereof” (v. 33)? Sacrifices of lesser holiness, such as [regular] @ITshlomim,@it may be eaten by all! @p1[32]@p2<TIE>The entire courtyard is referred to in this way.@d2 [Rashi knows] it does not mean literally at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting because why should these offerings be different from all other @ITkorbonos@it that are Holy of Holies, which are eaten [anywhere] in the courtyard of the Tent of Meeting? @p1[33]@p2<TIE>Through which atonement was achieved.<TIE>.<TIE>. “strange” and objectionable.@d2 I.e., everything strange and objectionable that Aharon and his sons did was atoned for them through this ram of the completion-offering and this bread. [Rashi knows this] because otherwise, [if @hh<HEB>כֻפַר@ee<ENG> referred to Aharon and his sons, and not to everything “strange and objectionable”,] it should say @hh<HEB>אשר כֻפְר@hhו@hh בהם@ee<ENG> (plural).<QC>
@d1By means of the ram and these breads.@d2 [Rashi is explaining that] Aharon and his sons became established into the priesthood by means of properly @ITperforming@it the ram and bread offerings, not by the previously mentioned @ITeating@it of them. @d1By means of these @HB<HEB>מלואים@BO<ENG>-offerings.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Rashi is explaining that @hh<HEB>לקדש אותם@ee<ENG> [should be understood as if it] is missing a @hh<HEB>ו@ee<ENG>, [and means @hh<HEB>ו@hhלקדש אותם @ee<ENG>]. Otherwise, it would convey that their installation is what sanctifies them for the priesthood, but this is not so. Rather, performing the @hh<HEB>מילואים@ee<ENG>-offerings causes both their installation in the service and their sanctification for the priesthood. @d1Holy of Holies.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 I.e., [a non-@ITkohein@it is forbidden to eat] from @ITevery@it kind of offering that is classified as Holy of Holies, not only from these offerings. [Rashi knows this] because Scripture gave a reason for the prohibition of “A stranger may not eat thereof,” [saying: “For they are sacred.”] This implies that the prohibition applies to all [offerings with similar sanctity]. @d1Scripture now repeats.<TIE>.<TIE>. critical.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Explanation:@BO@d2 from what was written before would lead us to say that these things are a mitzvah to do, but failing to do everything stated would not invalidate them as @ITkohanim@it and their service would be valid. Therefore Scripture repeats, to teach that [each thing] is critical.<QC>
@d1With these @BIkorbanos @BOevery single day.@d2 Rashi says this so we will not think it is sufficient to do it once, and we should divide it into seven parts, every day doing one part of these actions which sanctify them. Rather, on each of the seven days we must do all the actions and @ITkorbonos @itwhich are stated regarding this. @p1[36]@p2<TIE>I would know only something that is offered for their sake.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Otherwise, why does it say: “Offer a bull for a sin-offering @ITeach day@it”? It is already written (v. 35), “Seven days shall you install them,” and [the @ITkorbonos@it of] their installation consists of the bull for a sin-offering and the two rams. @d1Atonement for the altar was necessary.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Rashi is saying that [according to the Midrash,] it does not mean atonement from acts that are “strange and objectionable,” as with the atonement of Aharon and his sons (v. 33) — for that meaning does not fit here. @d1All anointings are in the form of @HB<HEB>כי@BO<ENG>.@d2 @hh<HEB>כ"י@ee<ENG> stands for @hh<HEB>כ"ף יונית@ee<ENG> (a Greek @ITchaf@it). It has the shape of our @hh<HEB>נ@ee<ENG>. @p1[37]@p2<TIE>Such as an animal used for bestiality.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 All these were disqualified before being brought into the courtyard, and are unfit [for the altar]. @d1For example.<TIE>.<TIE>. overnight .<TIE>.<TIE>. taken out .<TIE>.<TIE>. ritually unclean.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 All these were disqualified only after being brought to the courtyard. “Overnight” means the blood was left overnight, rather than being cast on the altar on the day the animal was slaughtered. The same is true if its flesh or parts to be burnt were left overnight. “Taken out” means the blood, flesh or parts to be burnt belonging to a burnt offering, sin offering or guilt offering that were taken outside the curtains [that enclose the @ITmishkon’s@it courtyard]. “Slaughtered.<TIE>.<TIE>. outside the time” means that when slaughtering the sacrifice, the @ITkohein@it had in mind to do one of the following things on a day when this is forbidden: 1.<TIE>burn the parts to be burnt 2.<TIE>burn its limbs 3.<TIE>eat its flesh. “Outside the place allotted for it” means that when slaughtering the sacrifice, the @ITkohein@it had in mind to eat its flesh outside its allotted place, i.e., outside the curtains [that enclose the @ITmishkon’s@it courtyard] or outside the wall [that encloses the @ITBeis Hamikdosh@it]. @p1[40]@p2<TIE>Forty-three and one-fifth eggs.@d2 [Rashi knows that it is of an @ITeipha@it] because it states in Bamidbar 28:5: “And a tenth @ITof an eipha@it of fine flour as a meal-offering.” An @ITeipha@it is three @ITse’ah,@it and a @ITse’ah@it is six @ITkav,@it and a @ITkav@it is four @ITlog,@it and a @ITlog@it is six eggs. Thus an @ITeipha@it is 432 eggs, a tenth of which is 43.2 eggs. @d1For the bowls.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 @hh<HEB>ספלים@ee<ENG> means bowls, as in (Shoftim 5:25): “In a majestic bowl (@hh<HEB>ספל@ee<ENG>).” @d1From there it runs down into the crevices.<TIE>.<TIE>. the altar.<TIE>.<TIE>..@d2 The @hh<HEB>שיתין@ee<ENG> are orifices in the altar’s foundation, as in (Tehillim 22:3): “When the foundations (@hh<HEB>השתות@ee<ENG>) are destroyed.” @p1[41]@p2<TIE>This refers to the @BIminchah.<TIE>.<TIE>.@bo@d2 I.e., we should not think that this @ITminchah@it is like other @ITmenachos,@it which are not entirely consumed on the altar. For then [we would mistakenly conclude that] “For a pleasing fragrance” — which conveys that the whole offering ascends to God — refers only to the sheep of the burnt offering and not to the @ITminchah.@it  @p1[42]@p2<TIE>That is where I will set it.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 I.e., the two phrases “Meet with you” and “Speak to you” are not two separate matters. Therefore Rashi skips the word @hh<HEB>שמה@ee<ENG>, [which seemingly separates it into two matters], so that the word @hh<HEB>שם@ee<ENG> at the end of the verse will suffice [to convey the meaning]. @p1[43]@p2<TIE>I will meet with them by speaking, as a king.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Rashi explains “By speaking” because the verse does not mention in what way Hashem will meet with them. Rashi then answers the question: [If so,] why is it not written, “I will speak”? He answers: “As a king who sets a meeting place where he will speak with his servants.” In other words, it is customary for a king to set a place to speak. Therefore the verse says simply, “I will meet,” without [needing to specify,] “I will speak.” @d1The @BImishkon.@bo I.e., the @ITmishkon@it will be sanctified by My @ITShechinah@it resting in it. Rashi is saying this even according to those Sages who hold that “Where I will meet with you” (v. 42) refers to a special place in the @ITmikdosh,@it namely, the copper altar. All agree that [in our verse,] “it will be sanctified” applies to the whole Tent of Meeting, i.e., the @ITShechinah@it will rest there.<QC>
@p1[1]@p2<TIE>To raise up on it burning.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 [Rashi knows this] because it does not say @hh<HEB>מזבַח@ee<ENG> as it does with @hh<HEB>מזבַּח העולה@ee<ENG> (38:1). Consequently, @hh<HEB>מזבֵּחַ@ee<ENG> is not connected with @hh<HEB>מקטר קטרת@ee<ENG>. It can connect only if we add the word @hh<HEB>להעלות@ee<ENG> (to raise up), so that it conveys: “An altar which is in order to raise up on it burning incense.” This is as Rashi explains: “Burning — smoke of incense.” @p1[4]@p2<TIE>Here it has the meaning of “corners”.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Although everywhere else it means “side.”<QC>
@d1Since the verse states: “on its sides” (@HB<HEB>על שני צדיו@BO<ENG>)<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Therefore we may infer that @hh<HEB>צלעותיו@ee<ENG> does not mean “sides,” which is why Rashi does not explain @hh<HEB>צלעותיו@ee<ENG> the usual way. Rashi adds the phrase, “On its two corners which are at its two sides,” so we will not think that@hh<HEB>על שני צדיו @ee<ENG> comes to explain @hh<HEB>צלעותיו@ee<ENG>. I.e., [we should not think] @hh<HEB>שני צדיו@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>שתי צלעותיו@ee<ENG> are the same. Rashi also parenthetically explains that “on its sides” means “@ITat@it its sides.” This is because the corners are at the sides, not on top of them. @d1The @BImaking @BOof these rings.@d2 Rashi is saying that @hh<HEB>והיה@ee<ENG> refers to [the implied word] @hh<HEB>מעשה@ee<ENG>, which is missing from the verse. Otherwise, [if it refers to the rings themselves,] it should say @hh<HEB>והיו@ee<ENG> (plural). @d1The ring itself will be.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 [Rashi is saying:] it does not mean that the rings will be for houses @ITand@it for poles. Rather, the rings will be houses, and the houses are for the poles. @p1[6]@p2<TIE>Lest you say that it should be somewhat drawn away from being exactly opposite the Ark.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Rashi is explaining why it is written, “In front of the covering,” after it already said, “In front of the @ITparoches.@it” It is because the @ITparoches@it traversed the whole width of the @ITmishkon. @itTherefore we might think that the altar was in front of the @ITparoches@it not right in the middle; the altar was rather drawn towards the northern or southern wall. Therefore Scripture adds, “In front of the covering.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @d1Every single day. He burns one @BIpras.<TIE>.<TIE>.@BO@d2 This means half a @ITmaneh@it in the morning and half a @ITmaneh@it in the evening, making a full @ITmaneh@it every day. @p1[9]@p2<TIE>Upon this altar.@d2 But on the copper altar, you may bring it.<QC>
@d1Neither burnt-offering nor meal-offering.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Rashi is explaining that the @hh<HEB>לא@ee<ENG> at the beginning of the verse refers also to the burnt-offerings [and meal-offerings]. It means, “And neither burnt-offerings nor meal-offerings.” @p1[10]@p2<TIE>For the uncleanness of the @BImikdosh @BOand its holy things.@d2 I.e., the bull and goat of Yom Kippur atone for the following: 1.<TIE>The @ITkohein@it knows he is unclean and accidentally enters the @ITmikdosh,@it thinking it is a regular building. 2.<TIE>The @ITkohein@it knows he is unclean and accidentally eats @ITkorbonos,@it thinking it is regular meat. 3.<TIE>The @ITkohein@it knows it is the @ITmikdosh@it but is unaware of his uncleanness. 4.<TIE>The @ITkohein@it knows it is @ITkorbonos@it but is unaware of his uncleanness. @d1Exclusively for these things.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 [Rashi knows this] because otherwise, why does it say here: “It is Holy of Holies”?<QC>
@p1[12]@p2<TIE>The meaning of “taking,” as Onkelos translates.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 @bo@hh<HEB>כי תשא@ee<ENG> is like, “Do not accept (@hh<HEB>תשא@ee<ENG>) a false report” (Shemos 23:1). It does not mean “lift,” as in: “Pharaoh will lift off your head (@hh<HEB>ישא את ראשך@ee<ENG>) from you” (Bereishis 40:19). In Bamidbar 1:2, it says about B’nei Yisrael: @hh<HEB>שאו את ראש@ee<ENG>. [There, it indeed connotes, “Lift off their heads,”] because Hashem foresaw that He would decree against them: “In this desert they shall perish” (ibid 14:35). However, pertaining to the Levites it is written @hb<HEB>פקד@hh את בני לוי@ee<ENG> (ibid 3:15), since they were not subjected to this decree. @d1Do not take a head count.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Rashi is telling us not to think it means that after you take the sum total of their numbers, then, “Each man shall give an atonement pledge.” Therefore he explains, “When you will wish.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Rashi is saying: when you want to know their number, let each give a half-shekel. Then you will have the half-shekels, and thereby you will know their number. But do not take a head count of them. Rashi states it in the negative, “Do not take a head count.” He does not state it [only] in the positive — “When you will wish .<TIE>.<TIE>. let each give a half-shekel then count the shekalim and you will know their number” — even though it so appears in the verse. Rashi thereby tells us it is not a mitzvah to count them specifically by half-shekels, so as to make the sockets [of the @ITmishkon@it from their silver]. Giving half-shekels is merely a means to keep the evil eye from them; they may be counted also by means of something else. Half-shekels are mentioned only because they can be used for the sockets, thus achieving two purposes. (@ITRe”m@it) @d1Like the one which occurred in the days of David.@d2 In Shmuel II ch. 24, David counted the people without half-shekalim. He thought the half-shekalim were a one-time decree for making the sockets of the Tent of Meeting, rather than for all times to buy from them the @ITkorbonos@it. And he thought that “Thus there will be no plague among them” means [that donating shekalim saves] from plagues in general, along the lines of, “Charity saves from death” (Mishlei 10:2). You might ask: In Shmuel II 18:1-2, when David counted the people and sent a third [of the army] with Yoav, a third with Avishai ben Tzeruya, and a third with Itai Hagiti, why then was there not a plague? Perhaps the answer is: Only when all Yisrael are counted does it cause the evil eye. @p1[13]@p2<TIE>The likeness of a coin made of fire.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 [Rashi knows this] because it is written @hh<HEB>זה@ee<ENG>, implying that God hinted to Moshe [to look at] a certain object. @d1The weight of the shekel which I set aside for you.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Rashi is answering the question: @hh<HEB>מחצית השקל בשקל הקודש@ee<ENG> seemingly implies they should bring a half-shekel, along with a whole shekel. But if so, Scripture should have written, “A shekel and a half”! Thus Rashi explains [that @hh<HEB>בשקל@ee<ENG> means]: “Based on the weight” of the sacred shekel.<QC>
@d1It now clarifies for you.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 I.e., the shekel was mentioned before, in @ITparshas@it Mishpatim, but there Scripture did not clarify for us how much it is. And “it @ITnow@it clarifies for you how much it is.” @d1For an @HB<HEB>אגורה@BO<ENG> of silver.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 @hh<HEB>אגורה@ee<ENG>, too, means @hh<HEB>מעה@ee<ENG>. @d1A whole shekel.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Rashi is answering the question: First it is written @hh<HEB>מחצית השקל@ee<ENG>. Why then is it written @hh<HEB>עשרים גרה @hbהשקל@ee<ENG>, implying they should give a whole shekel? Rashi answers: “A whole shekel.” I.e., a whole one is twenty @ITgeirah@it, of which they give half, which is ten @ITgeirah@it. @d1One sixth was added.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Rashi added this comment so we will not object: The verse says the shekel is twenty @ITgeirah@it, but really it should be twenty-four, for a whole shekel is four @ITzuz@it, and a @ITzuz@it is six @hh<HEB>מעה@ee<ENG>. Thus Rashi explains, “One sixth was added.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @p1[14]@p2<TIE>Here it teaches you.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 [How does Rashi know this?] Because it is written @hh<HEB>מבן עשרים שנה@ee<ENG>, so why does it need to say also @hh<HEB>כל העובר על הפקודים@ee<ENG>? Perforce, because “here it teaches you.<TIE>.<TIE>.” The term @hh<HEB>פקודים@ee<ENG> is used for the army, as in (Bamidbar 31:14), “Moshe was angry with the commanders (@hh<HEB>פקודי@ee<ENG>) of the army,” and as in (Shmuel I 13:15), “Shaul counted (@hh<HEB>ויפקוד@ee<ENG>) the people [of the army].” Thus, our verse uses the term @hh<HEB>הפקודים@ee<ENG> to tell us “that no one below twenty years of age goes into the army.” Accordingly, the passage means: “When you take the count of the B’nei Yisrael to go into the army for war, they shall be from twenty years and older.” You might ask: Why do we need to be taught here [by inference] that no one below twenty goes into the army? We were already taught this [expressly]: “From twenty years old and above, all those eligible for the army” (Bamidbar 1:3). The answer is: We might think Scripture was particular [about age] only regarding obligatory wars [such as the conquest of Eretz Yisrael], but not regarding optional wars [such as the conquest of surrounding lands]. Thus Scripture repeated it, [to teach that] for optional wars also, no one below twenty goes out to war. @p1[15]@p2<TIE>So that you not be struck.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 But it does not mean to atone for your sins, like other atonements mentioned in the Torah. [Rashi knows this] because [otherwise,] why is the atonement connected to the counting?<QC>
@p1[16]@p2<TIE>When they began to contribute to the @BImishkon.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Explanation: The mitzvah of “When you take the count” is general, for all time. [I.e., it teaches that a head count is always forbidden]. But it does not say to count them now. However, we see from “Donate it for the work of the Tent of Meeting,” which was for the sockets of the @ITmishkon@it, that Moshe was specifically commanded to count them before the erection of the @ITmishkon@it.<QC>
@d1Whereas the ages of the people are calculated.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Thus, they cannot become a year older until Rosh Hashanah. And even those born [shortly] before Rosh Hashanah become a year older with the arrival of Rosh Hashanah. @p1[18]@p2<TIE>This refers back to the wash basin.@d2 Rashi is answering the question: How could they wash from the base? Thus he explains, “This refers back to the wash basin.” @p1[19]@p2<TIE>He simultaneously washed his hands and feet.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 I.e., when they wash their hands, they must wash their feet with them. [Rashi knows this] because [the extra words] @hh<HEB>את@ee<ENG> come to add something. When it says @hb<HEB>את@hh ידיהם ו@hbאת@hh רגליהם@ee<ENG>, it conveys: “‘With’ their hands shall be their feet, and ‘with’ their feet shall be their hands,” i.e., both simultaneously. @p1[20]@p2<TIE>The incense, morning and afternoon.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Rashi [mentions burning the incense because he] holds that there is no death penalty for merely entering [the Tent of Meeting without washing,] if they do not perform service. And so it says in Zevachim 19b, that the words “for Divine service” in our verse refer [also] to “Entering the Tent of Meeting.” (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @d1In the Torah there were said things intended to be understood by inference.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 It seems that Rashi is answering the question: Why does the verse not say, “And if they do not wash, they will die”? This is a stronger exhortation than saying, “They will not die.” Thus Rashi explains [that this indeed is the intent]: “But, if they do not wash, they @ITwill@it die, for in the Torah there were said things intended to be understood by inference.” @ITRe”m@it explains: It is the way of Scripture to state the punishment that a person is liable for, not that which he is not liable for. This brought Rashi to explain, “In the Torah there were said things intended to be understood by inference, hence from the inference of the negative you may derive the positive.” Question: If so, is not the verse in effect saying, “If they do not wash, they @ITwill@it die”? Perhaps [the answer is:] @ITRe”m@it indeed meant what I wrote above. @d1The outer.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Rashi is answering the question: Since it is forbidden to enter the Tent of Meeting without washing, is it not obvious that one may not go to the [incense] altar? Therefore Rashi explains, “The outer altar.”<QC>
@p1[23]@p2<TIE>Half of what is @BIbrought @BOshall be two hundred fifty.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 [Rashi knows] it is not half its @ITmeasure@it, because then Scripture should simply write, “Five hundred,” [stating its full measure]. And since it is required to be brought twice, we may infer that it has tippings of the scale. But you cannot say that @hh<HEB>מחציתו@ee<ENG> refers back to the myrrh, conveying that the cinnamon is half the measure of the myrrh, i.e., two hundred and fifty. For if so, Scripture should simply write, “The fragrant cinnamon is two hundred and fifty,” without the word @hh<HEB>מחציתו@ee<ENG>. Perforce, @hh<HEB>מחציתו@ee<ENG> refers to the cinnamon [as Rashi explained]. @d1For things cannot be weighed to their absolute exactness.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Explanation: things cannot be weighed [on opposite arms of a scale] perfectly equally, without the scale tipping. @d1That contain no spices.@d2 They are only wood. @d1The amount of the total weight.@d2 I.e., we should not think that half the calamus is two hundred fifty, as it is with the cinnamon. [Rashi knows this] because otherwise Scripture should write @hh<HEB>קנמן בשם וקנה בשם מחצה ומחצה חמשים ומאתים@ee<ENG>. But now [that @hh<HEB>מחציתו@ee<ENG> is written only once, between cinnamon and calamus, it explains both the cinnamon and the calamus, as follows:] @hh<HEB>מחציתו@ee<ENG> as it relates to cinnamon refers to the cinnamon itself, [and conveys: “Half the cinnamon.” Thus] its whole measure is five hundred. But @hh<HEB>מחציתו@ee<ENG> as it relates to calamus refers back to what was mentioned above, [i.e., the cinnamon. Thus] it conveys: “The calamus is half the measure of the cinnamon,” as in total it is only two hundred and fifty.<QC>
@p1[24]@p2<TIE>To coat the roots this amount would be insufficient!@d2 @bo@hh<HEB>סיפק@ee<ENG> @hh<HEB>אינו@ee<ENG> means “not enough”. @d1But they soaked them in water.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 @hh<HEB>שראום@ee<ENG> means “soaking.” @d1Skimmed the oil off the roots.@d2 I.e., they poured and skimmed the oil off the roots. @p1[25]@p2<TIE>And the accent’s being on the first syllable indicates this. @bo@hh<HEB>למעלה@ee<ENG> means at the beginning of the word. @d1It is the same as @HB<HEB>רֶקח@BO<ENG> or @HB<HEB>רֶגע@BO<ENG>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 I.e., it is vocalized @hh<HEB>רֶ@ee<ENG> — unlike @hh<HEB>רוֹגע הים@ee<ENG>, which is a verb. @d1That one absorbs from the other.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 @hh<HEB>קופח@ee<ENG> means that one takes from the other. @p1[26]@p2<TIE>Anointings were done in the form of the Greek @BIchi.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 @hh<HEB>כ"י@ee<ENG> means a Greek @ITchi@it, which looks like a Hebrew @hh<HEB>נ@ee<ENG>.<QC>
@p1[29]@p2<TIE>It is this anointing which sanctifies them.@d2 Thus the verse means, “Anoint them, and they thereby become sanctified” — not that they should be anointed and @ITalso@it sanctified. I.e., their sanctification is not a separate action. See the @ITMinchas Yehudah@it who explains why Rashi did not explain this before, on: “All anointings were done in the form of the Greek @ITchi.@it”<QC>
@p1[31]@p2<TIE>@HB<HEB>זה@BO<ENG>. The numerical value corresponds to the twelve @BIlogs.@d2 You might ask: Why does Rashi [explain the words of] the verse in reverse order? The answer is: [Rashi brings this explanation of @hh<HEB>זה@ee<ENG>] as a contradiction to the teaching of our Sages, that “the entire @hh<HEB>שמן המשחה@ee<ENG> will be preserved for the time yet to come.” Assumedly, our Sages so interpreted because it is written @hh<HEB>זה@hh לי לדורותיכם@ee<ENG>, not @hb<HEB>כ@hhזה@ee<ENG>, thus implying that the oil itself will be “to Me for all your generations.” But, [argues Rashi,] this does not prove the Sages’ teaching, because @hh<HEB>זה@ee<ENG> teaches that there were twelve @ITlogs.@it [Thus, the Sages were interpreting Midrashically.] An alternative answer: On the contrary, Rashi is bringing a proof to the teaching of our Sages. The verse is saying: “For all your generations” will the number be represented by [the numerical value] @hh<HEB>זה@ee<ENG>, namely twelve @ITlogs@it.<QC>
@p1[32]@p2<TIE>In proportion to the measure of a @BIhin @BOof oil.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Explanation: Had Scripture written only @hh<HEB>ובמתכנתו@ee<ENG>, we would think that if he made it with the weight of these spices, he is liable even if he decreased or increased in proportion to a @IThin@it of oil. Therefore it is written also @hh<HEB>לא תעשו @hhכמוהו@ee<ENG>, to say that if he decreased or increased [the weight of these spices] he is not liable. @p1[33]@p2<TIE>From the one which Moshe blended.@d2 This was already prohibited in the previous verse. It is written again, “If he places from it upon an unauthorized person,” to teach that the punishment is @ITkareis.@it It conveys: “He who pours it on any man shall be cut off from his people.” However, nowhere does Scripture forbid us to pour oil made according to its formula on the flesh of any man. [This is how Rashi knows it is only, “From the one which Moshe blended,”] since there can be no punishment unless Scripture forbids it. @d1The priesthood or kingdom.@d2 This refers to the @ITKohein Gadol@it. Even a regular @ITkohein@it is considered an unauthorized person [pertaining to the use of the anointing oil]. And even the @ITKohein Gadol@it and the king themselves, after having been anointed, are considered unauthorized [pertaining to further use of the oil].<QC>
@p1[34]@p2<TIE>Including in our gatherings.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 [Rashi knows this] because otherwise, galbanum should have been mentioned either at the beginning or at the end, but not [in the middle] among them. @d1They should be counted with us.@d2 In order that Hashem will see that even the sinners are repenting, and thus He will have mercy on us. (@ITGur Aryeh@it) @d1So as to add an amount equal to the above.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 You might ask: How does Rashi know it means to add an amount equal to the above? Perhaps @hh<HEB>סמים@ee<ENG> means to add two spices, like the first @hh<HEB>סמים@ee<ENG> means. The answer is: Rashi’s proof is that it is not written @hh<HEB>סמים סמים@ee<ENG> together, at the beginning or end. Rather, [the second @hh<HEB>סמים@ee<ENG>] is written here in order to add an amount equal to the above.<QC>
@ee @p1[35]@p2<TIE>Thoroughly blended shall it be.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Rashi is answering the question: How does “Make it into.<TIE>.<TIE>.” apply to “pure and holy”? Something becomes pure and holy [not by what we do to it, but] by the absence of making impure and secular use of it. Thus Rashi explains: “Thoroughly blended shall it be, pure shall it be, and holy shall it be.” I.e., it shall be thoroughly blended by our making it so. But it shall be pure and holy on its own accord. @p1[36]@p2<TIE>This refers to the daily incense burning.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Rashi is explaining that it does not mean to place some of it before the Ark as a @ITremembrance@it; rather, to @ITburn@it it. @d1That I will set up to speak with you.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Rashi is explaining: And why is it called “Tent of Meeting”? Because every meeting place and time that I will set to speak with you, will be only there. @p1[37]@p2<TIE>You shall do it only for My Name.@d2 I.e., it does not mean literally [to make incense] for Adonoy, for it is written (Tehillim 50:12): “If I was hungry I would not tell you [to feed Me], for Mine is the world and its fullness.” Similarly with (25:2), “Have them take for Me a @ITterumah@it-offering”; [it does not mean literally for Hashem]. @ITGur Aryeh@it writes that Rashi explains this here, rather than on: “This shall be sacred anointing oil @ITto Me@it” (v. 31), because here the verses contradict each other. It is written: “It shall be holy of holies @ITto you@it” (v. 36), and: “It shall be sacred @ITto you@it” (v. 37). Yet it is written also: “@ITFor Adonoy@it” (v. 37). Therefore Rashi explained: “‘It shall be holy for you’.<TIE>.<TIE>. meaning: You shall do it only for My Name.” @p1[2]@p2<TIE>To do My work.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Rashi is answering the question: Why does it not say @hh<HEB>קראתי שם לבצלאל@ee<ENG> — “I gave a name to Betzalel”? Therefore he explains that it means: “I have called [someone] by name to do My work.” And whom did I call? Betzalel.<QC>
@p1[6]@p2<TIE>And the other wise-hearted.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 [Rashi explains this] so we will not think they were all with Betzalel, helping him. If they were, why is Oholiav specifically mentioned, above the other wise-hearted? Therefore Rashi explains as he does, saying that Oholiav helped Betzalel with all the craftwork that Betzalel did himself. But the other wise-hearted merely did the craftwork that Betzalel and Oholiav gave them to do. Accordingly, the passage reads as follows: “I have designated Betzalel.<TIE>.<TIE>. and I have also appointed Oholiav to be with him. Furthermore, the other wise-hearted among you, and all those I have given wisdom to, will do all that I have commanded you.” @p1[8]@p2<TIE>So called on account of its pure gold.@d2 Rashi is answering the question: Does this not imply that the other vessels were not pure? Alternatively, Rashi is explaining that @hh<HEB>טהור@ee<ENG> means “refined,” not “ritually pure.” (@ITRe”m@it) @p1[10]@p2<TIE>For it states.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 I.e., it is written immediately afterwards, indicating that they are different items.<QC>
@d1And the Targum of @HB<HEB>מכבר@BO<ENG>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 It is translated @hh<HEB>שרדין@ee<ENG> because it was net-work. Therefore, also @hh<HEB>שרד@ee<ENG> means net-work. @p1[11]@p2<TIE>For the purpose of bringing up smoke in the @HB<HEB>היכל@BO<ENG>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2. I.e., the @hh<HEB>ל@ee<ENG> [of @hh<HEB>לקדש@ee<ENG>] conveys “for the purpose of.” Rashi does not explain the verse according to its apparent meaning, that @hh<HEB>לקדש@ee<ENG> refers back to the anointing oil as well. This is because the verse should then say @hh<HEB>לְקַדֵש@ee<ENG> — “to render holy” — [for “to render holy” is the purpose of the anointing oil]. Whereas @hh<HEB>לַקֹדֶש@ee<ENG> conveys that it is already holy. (@ITGur Aryeh@it)<QC>
@p1[13]@p2<TIE>Though I have charged you.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Rashi is answering the question: Why was this section placed here? @d1To exclude Shabbos.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 You might ask: Was it not explained above that Shabbos is excluded merely by placing this section adjacent to [the work of the @ITmishkon@it]? The answer is: Above, only the public was excluded [from doing work], such as bringing the public donations. But we might think an individual may do work; therefore, Scripture had to write @hh<HEB>אך@ee<ENG>.<QC>
@p1[14]@p2<TIE>Provided there are witnesses and a warning.@d2 [Rashi knows this] because “Shall be cut off,” mentioned afterwards, is clearly a punishment by the hand of Heaven. If so, [we may infer that] “Shall be put to death” is a punishment by the hand of man. And man is executed only when there are witnesses and a warning is given. See @ITNachalas Yaakov,@it who explains why [is the double phrase] @hh<HEB>מות יומת@ee<ENG> written for the punishment of death by the hand of man. @p1[15]@p2<TIE>A restful rest.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 I.e., a rest that is significantly restful.<QC>
@p1[17]@p2<TIE>Now He, about Whom it is written.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 This is a question: I.e., “Hashem, about Whom it is written, ‘He does not become faint’.<TIE>.<TIE>. [how could He attribute rest to Himself?”] @d1Attributes “rest” to Himself.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 I.e., He says that “rest” should be written about Himself. @d1Only to accustom the ear.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 This is the conclusion of the answer.<QC>
@p1[18]@p2<TIE>There is no “earlier”.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 [Rashi knows the sin preceded the command] because otherwise, how could Moshe have known that God reconciled Himself [to the point that they may] make the @ITmishkon@it? For Moshe told them to contribute towards the @ITmishkon.@it [And if the command was before the sin,] perhaps God’s subsequent reconciliation was only regarding the giving the [second set of] Tablets, about which Moshe was expressly told (34:1), “Carve out two stone tablets for yourself.” [But perhaps God no longer desired the @ITmishkon.@it] God needed to give them the second Tablets so they would observe Torah law. God could not reject them from Torah observance because they had already converted and accepted Torah and mitzvos upon themselves. Although they went back to their evil ways [of idolatry], they were like apostate Jews, who are considered Jews in every way — certainly then the Bnei Yisrael, for they had repented, as it is written: “Bnei Yisrael [obediently] took off their ornaments.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (33:6). So it was only right to give them the Tablets. But God might not have reconciled Himself also for making a @ITmishkon@it to dwell in, for the @ITmishkon@it shows a special love. Perforce, [the sin preceded the command].<QC>
@d1He could not have learned it all.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Therefore, God gave it to him as a bride [is given to a groom] — i.e., as something that he acquires as his. @d1The statutes and laws.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Rashi is answering the question: It is written, “When He finished speaking with him.” What were the matters that God had finished speaking with Moshe? It cannot be the command of erecting the @ITmishkon@it, as the golden calf incident preceded it, as Rashi explained above. Therefore Rashi explains that He finished speaking with him the statutes and laws in @ITparshas@it Mishpatim. @ITRe”m@it writes: This section connects [chronologically] to the end of @ITparshas@it Mishpatim, where it is written (24:18): “Moshe came into the midst of the cloud and.<TIE>.<TIE>. remained on the mountain for forty days.” [Everything in between — the command of the @ITmishkon@it and the section about Shabbos — was actually after the golden calf incident. And that which Rashi says here, “The statutes and laws in @ITparshas@it Mishpatim,”] is not in accordance with R. Yishmael. For he says that the @hh<HEB>ו@ee<ENG> of @hb<HEB>ו@hhאלה המשפטים@ee<ENG> indicates a connection to that which preceded: just as the Ten Commandments were given with thunder and lightning, and said in the assembly of all Israel, so too were the laws [of @ITparshas@it Mishpatim presented. However here, Rashi explains that these laws were said to Moshe alone, during his forty days on the mountain.] @d1This teaches that Moshe.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Rashi inferred this because it is written, “Speaking @ITwith@it him,” rather than, “Speaking @ITto@it him.” Perforce, “This teaches that Moshe would.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @d1It is written @HB<HEB>לחת@BO<ENG> to indicate.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 [Since @hh<HEB>לחת@ee<ENG> is written without a @hh<HEB>ו@ee<ENG>, it connotes that] it was like there was only one Tablet.<QC>
@p1[1]@p2<TIE>Six hours have already come.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 I.e., the word @hh<HEB>בשש@ee<ENG> connotes @hh<HEB>באו שש@ee<ENG> (six have come). @d1And taught us the way.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Rashi is answering the question: First it is written @hh<HEB>עשה לנו אלהים אשר @hhילכו@hh לפנינו@ee<ENG>. Accordingly, it should then say @hh<HEB>כי זה משה האיש ש@hhהלך@ee<ENG>. This way it would convey: “Moshe, the man who once went before us, has now died. Therefore, make us gods who will go before us.” Why is it written @hh<HEB>אשר העלנו מארץ מצרים@ee<ENG>? Therefore Rashi explains that @hh<HEB>אשר העלנו מארץ מצרים@ee<ENG> is not to be understood literally; rather it means that Moshe taught us the way to go.<QC>
@p1[3]@p2<TIE>The meaning of unloading a burden.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Thus Rashi later explains that @hh<HEB>את נזמי@ee<ENG> means @hh<HEB>מן@ee<ENG> @hh<HEB>נזמי@ee<ENG>. This is because the @hh<HEB>ת@ee<ENG> [of @hh<HEB>וי@hbת@hhפרקו@ee<ENG>] makes it a reflexive verb [denoting “they unloaded themselves”]. But had it said @hh<HEB>ויפרקו@ee<ENG>, [a transitive verb,] Rashi would not need to explain @hh<HEB>את נזמי@ee<ENG> as @hh<HEB>מן נזמי@ee<ENG>. In addition, I found [an alternative explanation:] they had a small ring in their ears, on which their jewelry hung. [Accordingly, the verse means: “They unloaded the jewelry @ITfrom@it the small golden rings.”]<QC>
@p1[4]@p2<TIE>He had come out of the foundations.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Explanation: when the Israelites were in Egypt, building Pisom and Ramseis, and they failed to complete the amount of work they were told to do, the Egyptians came and took their children, put them into the wall being built, and placed stones around them and on them — thereby completing the amount of work. Moshe said to Hashem: “Master of the World! Why should the children be punished by such a death?” Hashem answered: “These children will not end up good. They will go in evil ways when they mature. Better they die while they are worthy.” Moshe went and removed a child who was crushed (@ITnimach@it) in a row being built. He was called Michah. @d1And he threw it into the melting pot and out came the Calf.@d2 Since “Arise ox” was written on it, the Calf arose, for it was a [young] ox. @d1And afterwards misled.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Therefore it says: “These, Yisrael, are @ITyour@it gods who brought @ITyou@it up.” I.e., the riffraff said this to the Israelites.<QC>
@d1As it is said, “in the form of an ox eating grass”.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 This refers to the Calf. @d1He thereby saw that the Satan’s act succeeded.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Satan caused disorder in the world at the sixth hour, and his deeds succeeded, for he achieved his aim. @d1Chur reprimanded them, they killed him.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Explanation: Chur reprimanded them for making the Calf, and they killed him. Thus Aharon was afraid to reprimand them, lest they kill him. You might ask: Rashi explained above, “‘He built an altar’ — so as to stall them.” Rashi comments on this, “That is its plain meaning.” [Yet the midrash says, “Through my @IT@itbuilding it and procrastinating in my work, in the meantime Moshe will come.”] If so, is the midrash not saying the same as the plain meaning? The answer is: [At first] Rashi is answering the question: Why did Aharon build a new altar? There was one already built, as it is written at the end of @ITparshas@it Mishpatim. Thus Rashi explains, “So as to stall them.<TIE>.<TIE>. that is its plain meaning.” Whereas the midrash’s interpretation answers the question: Why did Aharon build the altar, and not someone else? @p1[7]@p2<TIE>A term of harshness.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 However, @hb<HEB>וידבר@hh ה' אל משה לאמר@ee<ENG> is not a term of harshness, because @hh<HEB>וידבר@ee<ENG> is followed with @hh<HEB>לאמר@ee<ENG>. Thus, @hh<HEB>וידבר@ee<ENG> is the general [act of speaking], and @hh<HEB>לאמר@ee<ENG> specifies [what is spoken]. But here @hh<HEB>לאמר@ee<ENG> does not follow afterward. And it is written @hh<HEB>וידבר@ee<ENG> instead of @hh<HEB>ויאמר@ee<ENG>. Perforce it is a term of harshness. (@ITRe”m@it)<QC>
@p1[11]@p2<TIE>Can there be a thought of jealousy, unless it is.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Rashi is answering the question: Was it not right for Hashem to be angry with them for having made the Calf? Perforce, Moshe meant: “Can there be a thought of jealousy.<TIE>.<TIE>.” But above, on @hh<HEB>אנכי ה' אלהי@hhך@ee<ENG> (20:2), Rashi explains [our verse differently]: “Why is it in the singular form: @hh<HEB>אלהי@hbך@ee<ENG>? This was meant to give an opening for Moshe.<TIE>.<TIE>. This is what is meant when he said: “Hashem! Why should Your wrath blaze against Your people?’ [Meaning:] ‘It was not to them that You issued the command: You shall have no other gods, but only to me.’” Both [of Rashi’s explanations] are correct. @p1[12]@p2<TIE>Formulate another plan.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 I.e., act for them, and change from a thought of evil to a thought of good. [Rashi knows it means this] because the term @hh<HEB>ניחום@ee<ENG> always denotes [changing to] another thought. @p1[13]@p2<TIE>Their father Avraham.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 [Rashi knows that Avraham “has not yet received his reward”] because otherwise, why does it say, “Remember Avraham”? He already received his reward for his righteousness, and Hashem is no longer obligated on Avraham’s account to help his children.@ee@BO @bo @d1Remember Avraham who offered himself.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 [Rashi knows all this] because otherwise, why are all three mentioned? Mentioning just Avraham alone is sufficient. (@ITRe”m@it) Alternatively, Rashi is answering the question: Why is it written, “Remember Avraham, Yitzchok and Yisrael, Your servants, to whom You swore”? [Ostensibly,] Hashem is being asked to remember what He swore, and what He swore is written in connection with Avraham, as it is written: “‘By My Self I have sworn,’ says God.” So the order of the verse should be reversed: “Remember what you swore to Your servants Avraham.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Thus Rashi explains: “Remember for Avraham the ten tests.<TIE>.<TIE>.” I.e., Hashem is being asked to remember Avraham’s righteousness, not what He swore. Then Rashi answers the question: According to this, what is there to be remembered for Yitzchok and Yaakov? Thus he explains: “If by burning.<TIE>.<TIE>.” We need not ask: Why does Rashi mention the ten tests for Avraham? Perhaps [the verse is referring] only to the test of burning. The answer is: Since Avraham has both merits, and neither is more excludable than the other, [therefore both can be included as the verse’s intent]. @d1Certainly a chair with one leg.@d2 Some ask: What is the logic of this argument? Moshe also has the forefathers’ merit, for he is their descendant, as seen from (Bamidbar 14:12): “I shall make you into a greater nation,” where Rashi explains, “It is not written, ‘I shall make your @ITdescendants@it into a greater nation,’ because you are descended from the forefathers.” They offer an answer: Had the people not sinned with the Calf they would have entered the Land, as Hashem promised Avraham (Bereishis 12:7): “To your descendants I will give this land.” But now that He will destroy them, we see that the sin prevented the promise to Avraham from being fulfilled. If so, how do we know the promise to Moshe will be fulfilled, that his children will be a great nation? Perhaps his children too will sin, and this promise also will not be fulfilled. And if we argue that Moshe’s merit will persevere in any case, even if his children will sin, this claim is against logic: If the merit of three forefathers did not shield them from sin and bring them to the land, certainly the merit of Moshe alone will not.<QC>
@p1[15]@p2<TIE>A work of miracles.@d2 Explanation: [The letters were readable but ran in opposite directions on each side. The word @hh<HEB>נבוב@ee<ENG>,] for instance, was read as @hh<HEB>בובנ@ee<ENG>. And so with all the words. The miracle was that the writing was carved through both sides, including the @hh<HEB>ם@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>ס@ee<ENG> — and with them, the middle part was not connected at any point, yet it did not fall. But the Bereishis Rabbah explains that the writing was readable in the same direction on both sides, and this was indeed miraculous.<QC>
@p1[19]@p2<TIE>The foot of the mountain.@d2 Rashi is answering the question: Does “Beneath the mountain” not imply that the mountain had an interior cavity? Thus he explains, “At the @ITfoot@it of the mountain. @p1[20]@p2<TIE>He intended to test them as are women suspected of adultery.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 The reason being that he who strays after idolatry is like a married woman who strays from her husband by having relations with an adulterer, as is stated in the Midrash on Shir Hashirim 4:5 that Rashi cites. That is why Moshe tested them in the same manner as women who are suspected of adultery are tested. @d1As an idolatrous city when there are many involved.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 I.e., the death of the city dwellers is by the sword, as opposed to an individual idolater whose death is by stoning. @p1[21]@p2<TIE>How much pain did you endure.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 This is a rhetorical question: How much pain they must have caused you, that you were coerced into making them the Calf! Moshe said this to emphasize the point, that [in truth] they did not cause you any pain. @p1[22]@p2<TIE>They are always going.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Rashi is answering the question: Why is it not written it say @hh<HEB>כי רע הוא@ee<ENG>, [instead of @hb<HEB>ב@hhרע@ee<ENG>], if it refers to the Bnei Yisrael? He explains that @hh<HEB>ברע@ee<ENG> refers to the evil way. And Rashi adds the words “they are going” because “going” is the term that is associated with “way.” And Rashi adds the word “always,” because otherwise Aharon seems to be speaking of this [specific] way on which they intend evil. But this cannot be, because if Moshe had known of this [as the verse says, “You know,”] he should have taken preventative measures at the onset, before they did evil. Therefore Rashi adds “always,” to convey that in all their deeds they are always on an evil way. @p1[24]@p2<TIE>One thing.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 [Rashi knows this] because otherwise, the whole sin would be Aharon’s. I.e., Aharon did not say, “Remove them,” but just said, “Who has gold?” and they hurriedly removed [their gold ornaments]. @d1I did not know that this calf would come out.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 I.e., this calf came out without my forming it with an engraver’s tool. ]Rashi knows this] because otherwise, why did Aharon say, “And this calf emerged”? If he threw it in the fire and shaped it into a calf with an engraving tool, obviously this calf would come out. @ITRe”m@it writes: Scripture testifies that Aharon said, “Remove the rings of your wives” (v. 2), and that “he formed it with an engraving tool” (v. 4). If so, how could Aharon say, “I said one thing to them”? And how could he say, “I threw it into the fire,” intimating that it emerged by itself, when in fact he took the gold and “formed it with an engraving tool and made it into a molten calf” (ibid)? It seems [the answer is:] He said a lie because he feared Moshe. But this is difficult [to say], for how could Aharon, Hashem’s holy one, say a lie? See @ITNachalas Yaakov@it. @p1[26]@p2<TIE>“Come to me.”@d2 Meaning: he who is for Hashem, i.e., he who fears Him, should come to me. The word “come” is missing [from the verse, but implied. Rashi knows it means this] because otherwise it would be saying: he who is for Hashem and fears Him is [already] close to Me. Why would it then say, “All the sons of Leivi gathered to him”? @p1[27]@p2<TIE>“His brother” — having a common mother, and he is an Israelite.@d2 Rashi is answering the question: If the entire Tribe of Leivi was righteous, [as Rashi stated above], why does it say that each man [of Leivi] should kill his brother? He answers: “His brother — having a common mother,” for [such a brother] is not a Levite but an Israelite.<QC>
@p1[29]@p2<TIE>By this act you will install yourselves.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Explanation: Originally, the firstborn were priests to Hashem. But then they sinned with the Calf and sacrificed an offering to idolatry. Therefore you are to kill them, and you should become priests to Hashem in their stead. Rashi says, “You will install yourselves,” because @hh<HEB>מילוי יד@ee<ENG> means installation to a position that one will hold from then on, as Rashi explained in @ITparshas@it Terumah. @d1“For each man” amongst you will be installed [as a result of what each did] to his son.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 In connection with the actual killing, it mentions only an Israelite brother, relative and friend, [but not a son]. Nevertheless, here it says, “His son,” in order to emphasize the point. It conveys that each man would have killed even his own son to sanctify Hashem’s Name.<QC>
@p1[30]@p2<TIE>@ee@BIWiping away @BOand a @BIcovering @BOin front of your sins”.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Explanation: Rashi holds that every instance of @hh<HEB>בעד@ee<ENG> in Scripture means “in front of.” But here, this meaning does not fit [if @hh<HEB>אכפרה@ee<ENG>] means “atonement.” Therefore he explains that here, @hh<HEB>אכפרה@ee<ENG> does not mean “atonement”, but “wiping away” and a “covering.” Accordingly, “in front of” is fitting. @p1[31]@p2<TIE>“You are the One Who caused this to happen to them.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Rashi is answering the question: Why did Moshe say, “A god @ITof gold@it,” and not simply, “A god”? Perforce, he meant: “You are the One who caused this to happen to them.” @p1[32]@p2<TIE>From the entire Torah.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Although [all] the Torah had not yet been given, Moshe already wrote from Bereishis until the giving of the Torah, as previously explained (24:4). Alternatively, [Moshe was referring to] the Torah he was destined to write.<QC>
@p1[34]@p2<TIE>Here is an instance where @HB<HEB>לך@BO<ENG> is used connected with the verb @HB<HEB>דבור@BO<ENG> in the place of @HB<HEB>אליך@BO<ENG>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Explanation: @hh<HEB>לי@ee<ENG>, @hh<HEB>לך@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>להם@ee<ENG>, when following @hh<HEB>דבור@ee<ENG>, usually mean “about me,” “about you” and “about them,” [rather than “to me,” “to you” and “to them”]. This was explained in Bereishis 24:7. Nevertheless, @hh<HEB>לך@ee<ENG> here means “to you.” [Rashi knows this] because nowhere does it say that God spoke to someone else “about” Moshe. And so with [@hh<HEB>לדבר לו@ee<ENG>] written about Adoniyahu (Melachim I 2:19). There too it means “to him,” not “about him.” @d1But not I.@d2 Rashi is answering the question: Hashem’s intention is to punish them. But is it not good for them that “My angel will go before you”? It should say only: “Go, lead the people to [the place] which I have spoken to you. However on the day when I take account.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Therefore Rashi explains, “But not I.” In other words, this was bad for them, for the Shechinah itself was previously with them, [and now they will have only the angel].<QC>
@p1[3]@p2<TIE>Do I tell you to bring them up.@d2 [Rashi is explaining] that this connects to v. 1: “Leave, go up from this.<TIE>.<TIE>. to the land of which I swore.” It does not connect to what immediately precedes, [for then it would convey:] “And I will drive out the Canaanites.<TIE>.<TIE>. to a land flowing with milk and honey.” @d1For this reason I say to you.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 I.e., this gives the reason for (32:34), “Behold, My angel will go before you.” It is because, “I will not go up among you.<TIE>.<TIE>. I may destroy you.” This does not connect to what immediately precedes, rather to (v. 1): “Leave, go up from this.” @d1And you are rebellious against Me.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 [Question:] It is written in 34:9, “Let my Master go among us, for (@hh<HEB>כי@ee<ENG>) it is a stiff-necked people.” Does this not show the contrary to be true, that being stiff-necked makes it fitting for God to go among them, thereby contradicting what it says here? [The answer is:] Rashi already resolved this by explaining that the @hh<HEB>כי@ee<ENG> written there means “if,” conveying: “Since You bear iniquity.<TIE>.<TIE>. @ITif@it they will be a stiff-necked people and rebel against You.<TIE>.<TIE>. You will forgive our iniquity.” (@ITRe”m@it) @p1[5]@p2<TIE>Immediately, that you will remove your ornaments from yourselves.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 It means: I will do this to you immediately. The word “now” does not relate to that which preceded, as it does in: “Now here is your wife, take her and go” (Bereishis 12:19), and: “Now your two sons” (ibid. 48:5). [Rashi knows this] because our verse cannot be so explained. This is because the preceding statement is for their good. [To save them from destruction,] God is sending the angel rather than going Himself. Whereas this phrase, “Now remove your ornaments,” is a punishment. You might ask: Is it not written in v. 4 that they took off their ornaments of their own accord, as it is written, “No man wore his ornaments”? The answer is: There, they just removed them temporarily, out of mourning. But here, Hashem told them to remove them permanently. @d1I know what I have in My heart.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 I.e., it does not mean that through their removing the ornaments, He will know what to do with them, as the verse seems to imply. [Rashi knows this] because removing the ornaments is not a cause for God to know what to do with them. @p1[6]@p2<TIE>Their ornaments which they possessed.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 I.e., they did not remove their ornaments while still at Mount Chorev. [Rashi knows this] because they removed them only after the incident of the Calf. There is a @hh<HEB>ש@ee<ENG> is missing, for it is [as if it says @hh<HEB>עדים @hbש@hhמחורב@ee<ENG>.] The @ITKitzur Mizrachi@it asks: It already said in v. 4, “No man wore his ornaments.” If so, why did Hashem have to command, “Now remove”? @ITRabbeinu Bechaye@it answers: They refrained of their own accord from wearing all their ornaments, and wore only some. When Hashem commanded them, they completely removed and stripped themselves of all their ornaments. See other answers there. @p1[7]@p2<TIE>He thought: one who is ostracized by the master.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 I.e., B’nei Yisrael are ostracized by the Master, which is Hashem. Then too, [they should be] ostracized by the disciple, who is me; for I am Hashem’s disciple. @d1Two thousand @BIamohs.@BO.@d2 The reason [for this distance] was so everyone who sought Hashem could come on Shabbos to the tent, as was the arrangement in Yericho in Yehoshua’s time (Midrash Tanchuma ch. 27). @d1Even the ministering angels.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Rashi derives this from @hb<HEB>כל@hh מבקש ה'@ee<ENG>, which is an inclusive term. @p1[8]@p2<TIE>To go to the tent.@d2 Rashi is answering the question: Why is it written, “Whenever Moshe @ITwent out@it to the tent”? It should say: “Whenever Moshe @ITentered@it the tent.” Rashi answers that “went out” refers to Moshe’s exit from the Israelite camp, not Moshe’s tent. @p1[9]@p2<TIE>The same as @HB<HEB>ומדבר עם משה@BO<ENG>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 I.e., it is an ongoing action (the present tense). @d1“He heard the voice @HB<HEB>מִדַבֵר@BO<ENG> to him.”@d2 It is @hb<HEB>מִ@hhדַבֵר@ee<ENG>, as opposed to @hb<HEB>מְ@hhדַבֵר@ee<ENG>. This is because @hh<HEB>מְ@hhדַבֵר@ee<ENG> denotes that the king is speaking with a commoner, whereas @hb<HEB>מִ@hhדַבֵר@ee<ENG> means that the Voice is speaking to Itself. @p1[10]@p2<TIE>To the @BIShechinah.@d2 I.e., not to the entrance of Moshe’s tent, as @hh<HEB>איש פתח אהלו@ee<ENG> seemingly implies. The only reason it says @hh<HEB>איש פתח אהלו@ee<ENG> is because the Pillar of Cloud was there [i.e., at the entrance of Moshe’s tent]. @p1[11]@p2<TIE>After conversing with him.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 [Rashi knows that it was in order to teach what he had learned] because otherwise, why would Moshe return to the camp after God spoke to him face to face? The place where God spoke to him was where he dwelt, as it is written: “When Moshe had gone into the tent.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @d1Until the @BImishkon @BOwas erected but not longer.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Beforehand he did not act in this way because there was no time to learn or to teach, due to the troubles with the Calf, his praying for the people, and his receiving the second set of Tablets. @d1And on the nineteenth he went up, as it says.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 You might ask: In v. 18:13, Rashi wrote: “On the seventeenth of Tammuz he descended and broke the Tablets, and early the next day — which is the eighteenth of Tammuz he ascended.” [Why does Rashi say here that it was the nineteenth?] The answer is: In Taanis 29a, Abaye resolves a difficulty by saying that Tammuz in that year had thirty days [instead of its usual twenty-nine]. Rashi [in 18:13] calculates Moshe’s forty days and nights according to the [usual] pattern of a twentynine-day month being followed by a thirty-day month — based on Tammuz being always twenty-nine days — therefore Rashi says that Moshe ascended on the eighteenth of Tammuz. But when he calculates it according to Abaye’s statement that Tammuz in that year was thirty days [which adds a day,] he says that Moshe ascended on the nineteenth. (@ITRe”m@it) @ITNachalas Yaakov@it writes: It seems to me that @ITRe”m@it confused one Tammuz with another. Abaye spoke about the Tammuz when the Spies were sent, which was in the second year [after leaving Egypt]. Whereas the Tammuz of the Calf was in the first year. See there. An alternative answer: Moshe ascended on the [morning of the] eighteenth, but the calculation of forty days started only on the nineteenth. This is because the eighteenth was without the nighttime [i.e., it was not complete so it was not counted]. @p1[12]@p2<TIE>@HB<HEB>ראה@BO<ENG> means: Set Your “eyes” and Your “heart”.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 @ITRe”m@it writes that, in his opinion, the text in our books is corrupt. [Instead of the verse quoted,] it should have written, “And this that You said to me: ‘I will send an angel before you and I will drive out.<TIE>.<TIE>.’ (33:2).” This is because [the present verse,] “Behold, I am sending an angel” (23:20), was stated before the incident of the Calf. It is true that Rashi explains there, “Here they are foretold that they are destined to sin, and the Shechinah would then say to them: ‘For I will not go up among you.’” Nevertheless, the primary verse is, “I will send an angel before you,” which was stated after the incident of the Calf. @ITNachalas Yaakov@it [disagrees partially with @ITRe”m@it] and writes: It seems to me that it should rather say, “Behold, My angel will go before you” (32:34). First of all, this verse precedes, “I will send an angel before you” (33:2). Second of all, it is more likely to have been confused with (23:20), “Behold, I am sending an angel,” [due to their similarity,] thus causing the corruption in the text. @d1“By name” i.e., to recognize your importance.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Rashi is answering the question: Does the verse not imply that God knows only Moshe as an individual, whereas His knowledge and supervision of other people is only in general, not on an individual basis? Heaven forbid we should say this! God supervises all His creatures individually, from biggest to smallest. Therefore Rashi explains that “by name” conveys that Moshe is beloved and important.<QC>
@p1[13]@p2<TIE>If it is so that I have found favor in Your eyes.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Rashi is answering the question: Does the verse not imply that Moshe was unsure whether Hashem had said that he finds favor in His eyes? But earlier, Moshe told Hashem that He had said to him: “You have found favor in My eyes”! Rashi answers: Moshe surely knew it was true that [Hashem had said that] he found favor in His eyes. Moshe meant: “Is it really so that I have found favor? Perhaps when You said, “You have found favor in My eyes,” You were jesting as people have a manner of doing. @d1What reward do You give.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 [Rashi knows it means this] because otherwise, why did Moshe request this here? @d1What is this “finding of favor”.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Explanation: This [phrase in the verse] is connected to “Please let me know Your way.” The verse conveys: Let me know what reward You give to those who find favor in Your eyes. Then I will understand the meaning of this favor which I have found in Your eyes. @d1So that I may appreciate.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 I.e., so I may recognize and understand what benefit this finding of favor provides. And thereby I will know the degree to which You give reward for the favor which I have found in Your eyes. @d1My reward for this people.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Explanation: Just as I requested that You let me know what reward You will give me for the favor I found in Your eyes, so do I request that You let me know what reward You will give me for my leadership of this people. [Rashi knows it means this] because otherwise, why is this phrase here? (@ITRe”m@it) @p1[15]@p2<TIE>That is exactly what I wish.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Although Hashem already acquiesced to Moshe and said, “My Presence will go,” nevertheless, Moshe wanted to let Him know how much the people cherished His going with them. Thus he said that if, tragically, Hashem would not acquiesce to go with them, the people would not move from there until they died: they, their children and all that is theirs. @p1[16]@p2<TIE>I ask one more thing of You.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Rashi so explained the phrase of, “So that we will be distinguished — I and Your people,” because this request is not like the first one. The first request was to know the reward of finding favor and of leading the people. But this request is that the Shechinah should not rest on the other nations, only on Israel.<QC>
@p1[18]@p2<TIE>His words were finding acceptance.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 [Rashi knows this] because otherwise, this request does not belong here. @p1[19]@p2<TIE>The time has come for you to see of My Glory.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 [Rashi knows this] because it is evident from the verse as a whole that even without Moshe’s request, God needed to show him and teach him the order of prayer. This is because “I will cause all My @ITgoodness@it to pass.<TIE>.<TIE>.” does not answer Moshe’s request, which was to see Hashem’s @ITGlory@it. Thus Rashi says that God anyway needed to teach him the order of prayer, for it can be seen from what Moshe had said that [he thought] once the merit of the Patriarchs is exhausted, no longer is there any way for someone to make a request, Heaven forbid. For Moshe said (32:13), “Remember Avraham.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Therefore [said Hashem], I need to teach you the order of prayer, by which someone who makes a request can have it accepted. And when I show you this order, you will receive what you requested: seeing Hashem’s glory. This means seeing Hashem’s back, which is the tefillin knot [see Rashi on v. 23,] rather than seeing His face. [His face cannot be seen] because it says (v. 20), “For no man can see My Presence and live.” (@ITRe”m@it) @d1For My mercies are never exhausted.@d2 As opposed to the merit of the Patriarchs, where there is concern that it could possibly become exhausted. @d1That I will wish to be gracious.@d2 This is contrary to the verse’s apparent meaning, that God will be gracious to the people He is gracious to, and will be compassionate to the people He is compassionate to. [Rashi knows it does not mean this] because one who has received God’s graciousness does not need graciousness, and one who has received God’s compassion does not need compassion. Rather, it means: “At times I will respond, and at times I will not respond.<TIE>.<TIE>.”<QC>
@p1[21]@p2<TIE>In the mountain, where I constantly speak with you.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Rashi is telling us that the verse is elliptic, and Scripture should have written, “In the mountain.” Rashi says, “In the mountain, @ITwhere I constantly speak with you@it,” because the missing part should be understood from the verse itself. Rashi means to say that the place is assumedly in the mountain, as that is where God constantly speaks with Moshe. And since @hh<HEB>אתי@ee<ENG> seemingly implies [literally] “with Me,” not in the mountain, thus Rashi says: “I have a place prepared for your needs.” For this can be understood from @hh<HEB>אתי@ee<ENG>. @p1[22]@p2<TIE>When I pass by you.@d2 [Rashi is explaining that] “My Glory” refers to God Himself. The proof is that afterward it is written, “Until @ITI@it pass by,” rather than, “Until @ITMy Glory@it passes by.” @d1A place dug out in the rock. @hh<HEB>כריית@ee<ENG> means a place carved out in the rock, as in (21:33): @hh<HEB>כי יכרה איש בור@ee<ENG> (If a man digs a pit). @d1Onkelos translates it, “I will protect you with My word”.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 This is the Targum of @hh<HEB>ושכותי כפי@ee<ENG>. @d1Who does not need to cover him actually, with His Hand.@d2 Rather, He can cover him with His word. @p1[23]@p2<TIE>@HB<HEB>ואעדי ית דברת יקרי@BO<ENG>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 This is the Targum of @hh<HEB>והסירותי את כפי@ee<ENG>. Rashi explains that the Targum means: “When the guidance of My Glory is removed.”<QC>
@p1[2]@p2<TIE>Prepared.@d2 As in, “Send portions of food to he who has nothing prepared (@hh<HEB>נכון@ee<ENG>) for him” (Nechemiah 8:10). As opposed to its [other] meaning, “correct,” as in: “If in fact the report is true and correct (@hh<HEB>נכון@ee<ENG>)” (Devarim 13:15). @p1[3]@p2<TIE>Because the first ones were with great uproar.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 @hh<HEB>בתשואות@ee<ENG> means raising the voice. @p1[5]@p2<TIE>He called out in the Name of God (@HB<HEB>וקרא בשמא דה'@BO<ENG>).@d2 [Rashi is saying that] from Onkelos, it is evident that Moshe was the one who called. For if God was the One Who called, Onkelos would say@hh<HEB>וקרא בשמא ה' @ee<ENG>, [instead of @hh<HEB>דה'@ee<ENG>], thus conveying: “And Hashem called out in the Name.” (@ITRe”m@it) @p1[6]@p2<TIE>The first before man sins.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Explanation: Even though it is known to God that he is going to sin, still He has mercy on him because he has not yet sinned. @d1This, too, represents the Attribute of Mercy.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 But it is not pure mercy like the Attribute of the Four Letter Name. The Attribute of Mercy has many levels. @d1In case he will repent.@d2 The second attribute of “Adonoy, Adonoy” is also mercy after he sins. But it applies if he repents immediately, in which case He has mercy on him. However, this attribute is to put off His anger, hoping he might repent. @d1They do not have sufficient merits.@d2 [Rashi knows this] because it is written, “@ITAbounding@it in kindness,” implying that when the person sinned and his merits cannot shield him from punishment because they are few, nonetheless He tilts the scales towards kindness, and has mercy on him. The first attribute of “Adonoy, Adonoy” is when he has not yet sinned. But this attribute is that He tilts the scales towards kindness even after he has sinned. (@ITRe”m@it)<QC>
@p1[7]@p2<TIE>Which the person does before Him.@d2 I.e., not the kindness that Hashem intends to do for him. [Rashi knows this] because @hh<HEB>נוצר@ee<ENG> applies only to that which has already been done. @d1He does not clear those who do not repent.@d2 Although the second attribute of “Adonoy, Adonoy” also entails mercy for those who repent, the difference is: the attribute of “He clears” waives the sin and clears him as if he never did it, without bestowing any goodness upon him. Whereas the second attribute [of “Adonoy, Adonoy” bestows goodness upon him]. And this is the difference between the plain meaning, and the interpretation [of our Sages]: the plain meaning conveys that He does not completely waive the sin but exacts retribution for it bit by bit. Whereas the interpretation [of our Sages] is that He waives the sin completely. (@ITRe”m@it) @d1Five hundred fold for regarding the Attribute of Good.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Explanation: one generation of the Attribute of Retribution corresponds to five hundred generations of the Attribute of Good. Accordingly, the four generations of the Attribute of Retribution correspond to the two thousand generations of the Attribute of Good. @p1[9]@p2<TIE>There are places where @HB<HEB>כי@BO<ENG> is used in place of @HB<HEB>אם@BO<ENG>.@d2 Rashi is answering the question: On the contrary, is not their being a stiff-necked people a reason that He should @ITnot@it go with them? As it is written above (33:5), “You are a stiff-necked people. Were I to go up among you for one moment, I would destroy you.” Thus Rashi explains that this @hh<HEB>כי@ee<ENG> means “if,” as he goes on to elaborate. @d1Take us to Yourself as a special possession.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 (An alternative text:) “That You should give us a special possession.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Explanation: This [special possession] is the resting of Your @ITShechinah @itupon us alone, not upon other nations. Since Hashem already answered Moshe about this, Rashi therefore says: “This is the same request as: ‘so that I and Your people will be distinguished.’” I.e., Moshe is mentioning here what he had requested before. @p1[10]@p2<TIE>On this.@d2 I.e., on [the promise of] @hh<HEB>אעשה נפלאות@ee<ENG>, which has the same meaning as @hh<HEB>ונפלינו אני ועמך@ee<ENG> (33:16).<QC>
@p1[15]@p2<TIE>I will consider it for you.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 I.e., this comes to give a reason for the preceding [“Take care not to make a covenant”]. You might think that only their sacrificial services are prohibited, as I commanded you, “You must shatter their altars.<TIE>.<TIE>.” — but that nothing is wrong with making a covenant with them and participating in their feast, [while eating your own food (@ITAvodah Zarah@it 8a)]. Do not think so, because “I will consider it for you as if you concur in his idol worship.”<QC>
@p1[19]@p2<TIE>That is male of the first-born of the cattle and sheep.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 [Rashi is explaining that] @hh<HEB>אשר@ee<ENG> is missing from @hh<HEB>תזכר@ee<ENG>, and a @hh<HEB>ב@ee<ENG> is missing from @hh<HEB>פטר@ee<ENG>, so the verse means @hh<HEB>וכל מקנך @hbאשר@hh תזכר @hhב@hhפטר שור ושה@ee<ENG>. Rashi adds a @hh<HEB>ב@ee<ENG> to @hh<HEB>פטר@ee<ENG> because @hh<HEB>תזכר@ee<ENG> refers to the livestock which gives birth, not to the @hh<HEB>פטר@ee<ENG> [the first-born animal]. The verse thus conveys: “All your livestock which a male opens its womb, [that male is Mine].” @p1[20]@p2<TIE>Not of any other unclean animal.@d2 The reason it is specifically a donkey and not other unclean animals is explained by Rashi in 13:13.<QC>
@d1It remains non-sacred in the hands of the @BIkohein.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 [Rashi is explaining that] this is different from other consecrated and unfit animals which were redeemed, since they and [even] their replacements may not be shorn or used for work, since [the replacements] stand in their place. [And here, the baby donkey is consecrated as a first-born, but is unfit to be a sacrifice due to its species. Yet, after being redeemed with a sheep, it may be used for work.] @d1To teach about the severance pay to a Hebrew slave that it must be five @BIsela’im.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 I.e., it is written “empty-handed” here, relating to a donkey’s redemption. And it is written “empty-handed” in Devarim 13:15, relating to the severance pay of a Hebrew slave. Therefore, just as the redemption of a first-born [human being, as mentioned in v. 19,] is five @ITsela’im@it, so the severance pay is five @ITsela’im@it. Furthermore, the “empty-handed” of severance pay is at the beginning [of the section there], while [ostensibly] it should be at the end. Thus, we apply [the meaning of] “emptyhanded” [to all that follows it:] to “flocks,” to “winery” and to “threshing floor,” so that [the value of] five @ITsela’im@it of each [of the abovementioned] kind should be [paid to the Hebrew slave]. @p1[21]@p2<TIE>Which extends into the post-@BIsheviis @BOyear.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 [Rashi knows this] because if it referred to Shabbos, other labors are also forbidden? Thus Rashi explains that it means not to plow a field of grain or of fruit trees, if it will benefit the [coming] @ITsheviis@it year. “Harvest of the @ITsheviis@it year” refers to grain that reached a third [of its growth] in the @ITsheviis@it year, thus the laws of @ITsheviis@it apply to it [even] in the year after @ITsheviis@it. @d1Just as the plowing is optional.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Explanation: There is no obligatory plowing. Even to plow specifically for the @ITomer@it and the “two breads” [of Shavuos is not obligatory. Thus] it is forbidden to plow on Shabbos. Similarly, harvesting is forbidden if it is optional, but not if it is obligatory. [Harvesting the @ITomer@it is considered obligatory] because even if you found it harvested, it is obligatory to harvest [a different @ITomer@it. However, if you found plowed ground, it is not obligatory to plow (@ITMakkos@it 8b)]. Hence from here we learn that the harvesting of the @ITomer@it takes precedence over Shabbos. @p1[22]@p2<TIE>When you bring the “two breads”.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 I.e., not that this is the time of harvesting the first wheat crops. Rather, they now start harvesting to bring a @ITminchah@it from wheat. @p1[23]@p2<TIE>All the males among you.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 [I.e., @hh<HEB>זכור@hhך@ee<ENG> is not literal and] does not mean, “the males that are @ITyours@it.” [Rashi knows this] because even male children are not yours, i.e., they are not in your ownership, and surely not the adults who are obligated in mitzvos. Rather, it means the males who are among you, i.e., in your nation. @p1[24]@p2<TIE>Therefore I establish for you.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 [Rashi knows this] because otherwise, why does it say, “@ITFor@it I will drive out”? How does this give a reason [for the preceding]? @p1[25]@p2<TIE>While @BIchometz @BOstill remains.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 I.e., rearrange the verse and explain it as follows: “Do not slaughter My [Pesach] sacrifice, and do not sprinkle its blood, ‘on’ @ITchometz@it.” [The word “on”] means while @ITchometz@it still remains. It does not mean literally [that the sacrifice is] actually “on” it.<QC>
@d1Or to any member of the group.@d2 Rashi is not saying that the prohibition is on the slaughterer, or on the sprinkler, [etc]. Rather, he is saying that if one of them has @ITchometz@it in his house [when the @ITkorban Pesach@it is slaughtered], he transgresses a negative precept. However, Rashi does not explain who transgresses: the slaughterer, the sprinkler, or both. @d1Remaining overnight does not render it unfit.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 @hh<HEB>מועלת@ee<ENG> is similar to the word @hh<HEB>מעילה@ee<ENG> [misappropriation of consecrated property]. Rashi is saying that if the sacrifice was on top of the altar, remaining overnight does not render it unfit. In other words, if the parts to be burnt were brought up to the altar’s top before dawn, they are not rendered unfit [at dawn,] even if they were not yet offered [on the altar’s fire]. @d1Applies only at dawn.@d2 I.e., only if the fat remains until dawn is it rendered unfit. However, if it remains all night but is burnt before dawn, this is not called remaining overnight. @d1The parts to be burnt.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 [Rashi knows this] because from the @ITkorbon Pesach,@it [most of the meat is eaten]; only the parts to be burnt (@hh<HEB>אימורים@ee<ENG>) are offered. @d1All fats and limbs that require burning.@d2 I.e., [we learn] not to offer them after dawn, [since they are then unfit. Rashi knows] that all offerings are included, and become unfit through remaining overnight, because it is written @hb<HEB>זבח @hhחג הפסח@hh@ee<ENG> and not just @hh<HEB>חג הפסח@hh@ee<ENG>. @p1[26]@p2<TIE>Which are listed in praise of your land.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Rashi does not mean that this is derived from the word @hh<HEB>אדמתך@ee<ENG>. For in Devarim 26:2, it is derived from a @ITgezeirah shavah@it between @hh<HEB>ארצך@ee<ENG> (@ITad loc@it) and @hh<HEB>ארץ@ee<ENG> (Devarim 8:8). Rashi here is rather saying that @hh<HEB>אדמתך@ee<ENG> does not mean you must bring first fruits from all the [species of] fruits in your land; only from the seven species, as derived from the @ITgezeirah shavah@it of @hh<HEB>ארץ ארץ@ee<ENG>. @d1Referring to date-honey.@d2 Rashi is answering the question: The seven species include honey, and honey is not a fruit. But regarding the first fruits, it is written, “Of all the @ITfruits@it of the land” (Devarim 26:2), implying fruit only? Rashi answers that the honey is date-honey, and dates are fruit. @d1An admonition.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 It does not mean only “in its mother’s milk”; the admonition applies also to its own milk. It says “its mother’s milk” in order to exclude fowl, which has no mother’s milk — as Rashi goes on to explain. @d1Once prohibiting the cooking.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 Question: Why are two verses needed for prohibiting the mixing of meat in milk, one to forbid eating and one to forbid benefit? Regarding other Torah prohibitions where it is written, “You shall not eat,” it includes both eating and benefit. The answer is: A person is liable for eating meat in milk even if he has no benefit while eating, for instance, [the food is very hot and] his throat is burnt while eating it. This is not the case with eating other prohibited foods. @d1Which it is necessary to explain in many places.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 [Rashi says “in many places”] because if the Torah had explained “a goat’s kid” in only one place, we would say that here, too, it means specifically a goat’s kid. We would learn the meaning of this non-explained place from the explained place. But since it says “a goat’s kid” in several places, we thereby learn that “goat’s kid” applies only where the Torah specifically states it. This is because all Sages agree that three [or more] verses stating the same point, [each in a different place,] do not teach a general rule. Thus, wherever the Torah does not state “goat’s kid” — such as here, where it is non-explained — all suckling animals are implied. @p1[27]@p2<TIE>But you are not permitted to write.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 [Rashi knows this] because “these” is an exclusionary word, [implying: “these” and not “those”]. @p1[29]@p2<TIE>When he brought the Second Tablets.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 When he brought the First Tablets on the seventeenth of Tammuz, it is also written that “Moshe went down from the mountain with the two Tablets of the Testimony in his hand” (Shemos 32:15), like it is written here. Nevertheless, [Rashi knows that the verse here speaks of the Second Tablets because] all the following incidents took place only with the Second Tablets. @d1From where was Moshe privileged for these rays of splendor.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 I.e., why was he privileged to them with the Second Tablets, and not with the First Tablets?<QC>
@p1[31]@p2<TIE>In the present (ongoing) tense.<TIE>.<TIE>.@d2 [How does Rashi know this? The answer is:] Since nothing specific was spoken here, it must refer to what God spoke to Moshe on Mount Sinai — which is the message of God to Israel. I.e., Moshe is to teach them the whole Torah. Perforce, this entire subject is in the present (ongoing) tense. Moshe would call them every day and teach the Torah and mitzvos to the leaders and then to all Yisrael, as explained further on. This continued even after the @ITmishkon@it was erected.<QC>
@p1[1]@p2<TIE>On the day following Yom Kippur.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because it is written above, “When Moshe came down from Mount Sinai” (33:29), and that was on Yom Kippur. And this verse relates back to that event, because [when the Torah finishes the account of Moshe’s coming down, immediately] afterwards it is written, “Moshe assembled.<TIE>.<TIE>.” Thus we see it was the day following Yom Kippur. (@ITRe”m@it) Furthermore, the assembly was mainly for donating toward the work of the @ITmishkon@it so that the donated gold should atone for the gold given for the Calf. Therefore, we may assume it happened immediately after Moshe came down from the mountain, in order to atone right away for the incident of the Calf, and so that Hashem’s anger against Yisrael should be removed. See 31:18 [Rashi there]: [“On Yom Kippur, God reconciled Himself to Yisrael. The next day they began donating to the @ITmishkon@it.”] You might ask: How did Moshe have time to assemble them and tell them to donate to the @ITmishkon@it? The day after Yom Kippur he sat to judge the people all day, as it says: “On the following day Moshe sat to judge .<TIE>.<TIE>. from morning until evening” (18:13). And Rashi there explains, “It was the day following Yom Kippur,” and goes on to prove it. The answer is: Rashi there answers it himself by saying that “From morning until evening” [is not to be understood literally. Rather, it] is to teach us that “every judge who judges correctly and truthfully is .<TIE>.<TIE>. as if he were involved in Torah study the entire day.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @d1It (@HB<HEB>ויקהל@BO<ENG>) is in the causative form.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Explanation: Rashi’s main proof is that it is vowelized @hh<HEB>וַ@hbיַּ@hhקְהֵל@ee<ENG> rather than @hh<HEB>וַ@hbיִּ@hhקְהַל@ee<ENG>. The @ITpasach@it indicates the causative form, as in @hh<HEB>וַ@hbיַּ@hhסַּע משה את העם@ee<ENG> (15:22), and @hh<HEB>אשר המה @hbמַ@hhלִינִים@ee<ENG> (Bamidbar 14:27), which are also in the causative form. @d1The correct version of this in Onkelos is: @HB<HEB>ואכניש@BO<ENG>.@p3 @ITRe”m@it writes: “I do not understand what Rashi means by this.” @ITNachalas Yaakov@it writes: It seems to me that Rashi wrote this because he saw two versions of Onkelos. Therefore he proves that the correct version is [the causative form] @hh<HEB>ואכניש@ee<ENG>, not @hh<HEB>וכנש@ee<ENG>. Similarly in Bamidbar 16:19, @hh<HEB>וַיַקְהֵל עליהם קרח@ee<ENG>, Onkelos writes @hh<HEB>ואכניש@ee<ENG>. But in Bamidbar 20:10, @hh<HEB>וַיַּקְהִילוּ .<TIE>.<TIE>. אל פני הסלע@ee<ENG>, Targum Onkelos and Targum Yonasan both say @hh<HEB>וכנשו@ee<ENG>. @p1[2]@p2<TIE>Saying .<TIE>.<TIE>. it does not supersede<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Why are they admonished again here concerning Shabbos? They had already been admonished. You might ask: On the contrary, perhaps the admonition of Shabbos is repeated here to tell us that the work of the @ITmishkon@it supercedes Shabbos, even though it is written [pertaining to Shabbos], “You must not do any work” (Shemos 20:9)? The answer is: The section of Shabbos is written before the section dealing with the work of the @ITmishkon@it. And the section written first is surely the more important one, and supersedes the one written afterward. The proof is that otherwise, a question arises: why did Moshe change the order here? In @ITparshas@it Ki Sisa, Hashem stated the admonition of Shabbos to Moshe @ITafter@it having stated the work of the @ITmishkon@it. And that is why it is written there, “Still (@hh<HEB>אך@ee<ENG>), you must keep My Shabbos” (31:13). As Rashi explains there, “Every time the term @hh<HEB>אך@ee<ENG> or @hh<HEB>רק@ee<ENG> appears, it conveys limiting or excluding. And here, @hh<HEB>אך@ee<ENG> apparently excludes Shabbos from any work of the @ITmishkon@it.” Thus, the question arises: why did Moshe not state this matter to Yisrael in the same way that Hashem had commanded him? Perforce, Moshe put [the section of Shabbos] first, in order to teach that the work of the @ITmishkon@it does not supercede Shabbos.<QC>
@p1[3]@p2<TIE>Some of our Sages say: Kindling.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Is kindling not already included in the prohibition, “You must not do any manner of work”? @d1“Went out” to be a @HB<HEB>לאו@BO<ENG>.@p3 I.e., it is not a principle category of labor, punishable by @ITkareis@it and stoning, but merely a negative precept. @d1Others say it “went out” to separate.@p3 I.e., we would have thought that if someone did all thirty-nine types of labor within one lapse of awareness, he is obligated to bring only one sin offering. Therefore, it “went out” to separate: [just as kindling was singled out here, so should all the thirty-nine types of labor be singled out one from another, each requiring its own sin offering]. @p1[4]@p2<TIE>Me, to tell you.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because the verse seems to mean: This is the word which He has commanded to all of Israel to say (@hh<HEB>לאמר@ee<ENG>) to others. [Yet, it cannot mean this]. Therefore Rashi explains: He commanded me to tell you this in an assembly, as opposed to the other instructions which were not in an assembly. @p1[5]@p2<TIE>Since it is his heart that inspires him.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Why did Scripture choose to write, “Generous of heart”? Rashi answers: “Since it is his heart that inspires him.”<QC>
@p1[11]@p2<TIE>The lower drapes<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Since it is written, “The @ITmishkon@it,” why was it necessary for Scripture to write, “Its tent and its cover”? Everything is included in @IT“mishkon”@it! @d1Goat-hair drapes<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because we find that the goat-hair drapes are called @hh<HEB>אהל@ee<ENG>, as it says: “Make drapes of goats’ hair for an @hh<HEB>אהל@ee<ENG> over the @ITmishkon@it” (26:7). @d1Rams’ skins and the @BItachash@bo@it@BO-skins<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because it is written, “Make a @ITcovering@it for the tent out of red-dyed rams’ skins and.<TIE>.<TIE>. @ITtachash-@itskins.<TIE>.<TIE>.” (26:14). @p1[12]@p2<TIE>@BIParoches@BO of the partition<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Does @hh<HEB>פרוכת@ee<ENG> not mean a curtain hung at the entrance, while @hh<HEB>מסך@ee<ENG> means a covering spread out as a roof? Therefore Rashi explains that @hh<HEB>מסך@ee<ENG> means “partition.” And so it must be understood in several places in this section. The term @hh<HEB>מסך@ee<ENG> sometimes means “roofing,” and sometimes it means “partition,” as in: “You have protected (@hh<HEB>סכת@ee<ENG>) him” (Iyov 1:10), and: “Behold I will protect (@hh<HEB>סך@ee<ENG>) your road” (Hoshe’a 2:8). @p1[13]@p2<TIE>Because it had a face<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Any woman can bake bread. [Why did it say (v. 10), “All those who are @ITwise in heart@it among you shall come and make”?] Thus Rashi explains, “I have explained.<TIE>.<TIE>. it had a face in two directions.<TIE>.<TIE>..” Therefore it needs “wise in heart” [to bake it].<QC>
@p1[22]@p2<TIE>@HB<HEB>על הנשים@ee<ENG> @BOmeans @BIwith@BO the women<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: [Why were the donations accepted?] Only a small amount of tzedakah may be accepted from a [married] woman, [unless the husband approves]. Thus Rashi says that the men came @ITwith@it the women, [showing they approve]. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @d1Worn on the arm<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 ]Rashi knows this] because Onkelos translates @hh<HEB>חח@ee<ENG> as @hh<HEB>שירין@ee<ENG>. And so does he translate @hh<HEB>אצעדה@ee<ENG> in Bamidbar 31:50, and @hh<HEB>צמידים@ee<ENG> in Bereishis 24:22. These [latter two] are clearly ornaments worn on the arm. @d1Our Sages explained<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering a question on his own explanation: Does this not imply that @hh<HEB>כומז@ee<ENG> is a noun referring to something [in the form] of one’s private parts? But, our language is called the Holy Tongue because it has no specific word for one’s private parts! Therefore Rashi brings our Sages’ explanation [that it is not a noun, but an abbreviation for “here is the place of lewdness”]. @p1[23]@p2<TIE>Or rams’ skins or @BItachash@BO skins — they all brought.@p3 Some ask: Why does Rashi not list them as they are written — “Greenish-blue wool, dark red wool, crimson wool, @ITfine linen, goats’ hair@it, red dyed rams’ skins”? [Rather, Rashi omits fine linen and goats’ hair.] It seems to me that Rashi may be explained by first asking another question on Rashi: Why does he [need to] explain that the verse means @ITor@it this, @ITor@it that? Why would we [otherwise] have thought that only someone who has @ITall@it these items should bring, and someone who does not, should not bring [anything]? A poor person who has only one item would be excluded! Yet Scripture said (25:2), “From @ITevery@it man whose heart impels him to generosity shall you take My terumah-offering.” Perforce, [Rashi explains this] because throughout the work of the @ITmishkon@it and the garments of the @ITKohein Gadol@it, we find that the three items of greenish-blue wool, dark red wool and crimson wool are always [mentioned together]. Similarly, the red dyed rams’ skins and the @ITtachash@it skins together formed the cover of the tent, as Rashi explains in 26:14. Thus we might think that whoever has all these things, [i.e., the three wools, or the two skins,] should bring. But he who has only one, should not. This is because all three are needed for the work; nothing is made of one without the other. Whereas the garments of ordinary @ITkohanim@it are made of fine linen alone, and so are the four garments of the @ITKohein Gadol@it used for the inner service of Yom Kippur and for some other services. Similarly, goats’ hair was used only for the drapes of goats’ hair, [never together with other materials]. Therefore it is obvious that one could bring fine linen or goats’ hair by itself, and Rashi does not [need to] mention it because this is obvious. Furthermore, it is written: “All the women whose hearts inspired them.<TIE>.<TIE>. spun the goats’ hair” (v. 26), implying that goats’ hair was brought by itself. And “fine linen” (end of v. 25) is juxtaposed [specially] to “goats’ hair.” Throughout Scripture, fine linen is mentioned at the beginning [of the items], but here, it is [mentioned at the end,] next to goats’ hair. This comes to teach that fine linen should be compared to goats’ hair, which is brought by itself. This is why Rashi did not need to explain that fine linen and goats’ hair may be brought by themselves, [and he therefore omitted them].<QC>
@p1[30]@p2<TIE>He was Miriam’s son.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Why does the Torah trace Betzalel back only as far as Chur? Alternatively, why does it not say, “Betzalel, son of Uri, of the tribe of Yehudah”? Rashi answers that Chur was the son of Miriam, who was a prophetess — and that is why Betzalel merited all this [honor].<QC>
@p1[5]@p2<TIE>More than is.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 The @hh<HEB>מ@ee<ENG> [of @hb<HEB>מ@hhדי@ee<ENG>] means “more than,” as in (Bereishis 29:30), “He loved Rochel more than Leah (@hb<HEB>מ@hhלאה@ee<ENG>).” Rashi adds the phrase, “What was needed for,” because the people brought only what was needed for the work, not the [completed] work itself.<QC>
@p1[7]@p2<TIE>The work of bringing was sufficient<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is explaining that the first @hh<HEB>המלאכה@ee<ENG> in the verse refers to bringing the donations, and the second, to the actual work of the @ITmishkon@it.@IT @it[Rashi knows this] because if it means the same thing [both times] there is no reason for @hh<HEB>המלאכה@ee<ENG> to be mentioned again! Also, [Rashi is explaining that] the suffix of @hh<HEB>די@hbם@ee<ENG> refers to the workers. @d1As in “(@HB<HEB>והכבד@BO<ENG>) @bo@ee@BIto harden @bo@it@BOhis heart”<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Does @hh<HEB>והותר@ee<ENG>, [which is in the imperative,] not imply that it is a mitzvah to leave over? But this is not so; there is no such mitzvah. Therefore Rashi explains that it conveys @hh<HEB>ו@hbלְ@hhהוֹתִיר@ee<ENG>, [in the infinitive], and that there are other such words [in the infinitive which are] missing a @hh<HEB>ל@ee<ENG>, such as @hh<HEB>והכבד@ee<ENG>, [meaning] @hh<HEB>ו@hbלְ@hhהַכְבִד@ee<ENG>, and @hh<HEB>והכות@ee<ENG>, [meaning] @hh<HEB>ו@hbלְ@hhהַכוֹת@ee<ENG>.<QC>
@p1[1]@p2<TIE>Because he extended himself for the work<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., throughout the section it is written, “He made,” but it is not written “Betzalel” as it does about the ark. This is because they [the other items] do not have as much sanctity as the ark, so Betzalel did not wish to exert himself as much in making them. Instead, Betzalel showed Oholiav and the other disciples [what to do], and they made them. But the ark possessed great sanctity, so Betzalel personally exerted himself over it and extended himself more for the work.<QC>
@d1Their purpose is to incite the evil inclination<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 You might ask: The @hh<HEB>כומז@ee<ENG>, which is in the shape of the woman’s private parts, is even more repulsive. [Yet, Moshe readily accepted the @hh<HEB>כומז@ee<ENG>.] Why did Moshe not find it repulsive? The answer is: About the @hh<HEB>כומז@ee<ENG> it is written that the women brought it together with bracelets, nose-rings and fingerrings. Then it was all melted down together by fire, and the @hh<HEB>כומז@ee<ENG> became nullified among them. Here, however, they did not bring any copper other than the mirrors. An alternative answer: The @hh<HEB>כומז@ee<ENG> is for nullifying the evil inclination. I.e., it [guards the private parts and] prevents from coming to lewdness. But the mirrors facilitate lewdness, so Moshe found them repulsive. @d1God said to him: Accept.@p3 Meaning: you should accept them.<QC>
@d1Entice him (@HB<HEB>ומשדלתו@BO<ENG>) with words. @bo@hh<HEB>ומשדלתו@ee<ENG> means verbal seducement, for Onkelos translates (22:15) @hh<HEB>כי יפתה@ee<ENG> [as @hh<HEB>ארי ישדל@ee<ENG>.] @d1That is the intent of what is said: “By the mirrors of the @HB<HEB>צובאות@BO<ENG>”<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., @hh<HEB>הצובאות@ee<ENG> comes from @hh<HEB>צבאות@ee<ENG> (hosts). @hh<HEB>במראות הצובאות@ee<ENG> conveys: with the mirrors from which very many hosts came. @d1Whose husband expressed jealousy and she nevertheless concealed herself<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., he who expresses jealousy to his wife then tests her with these cursing waters, as written in Bamidbar 5:17. @d1Onkelos also translates it this way: @HB<HEB>במחזית@BO<ENG> of the women<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 I.e., also Onkelos translates @hh<HEB>מראות@ee<ENG> to mean mirrors used by women for adorning themselves. For he translates @hh<HEB>והגליונים@ee<ENG> as @hh<HEB>מחזייתא@ee<ENG>, and @hh<HEB>והגליונים@ee<ENG> are surely mirrors used by women for adorning themselves. @d1To bring their contribution.@p3 Rashi means as follows: the word @hh<HEB>צבאו@ee<ENG> comes from @hh<HEB>צבא@ee<ENG> (host). I.e., people gathering together. And [this raises the question:] why did he gather them together? Thus Rashi explains: to bring their contribution to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.<QC>
@p1[18]@p2<TIE>Like the measurements of the curtains of the courtyard.@p3 The word @hh<HEB>לעומת@ee<ENG> is ordinarily used for something that is “across from.” Yet, the curtains were not across from [the screen], but at its sides. Thus Rashi explains: “Like the measurements.” I.e., the screen should be the same size [as the curtains].<QC>
@p1[21]@p2<TIE>All the weights of the contributions of the @BImishkon@BO<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Why did the verse not say, “@ITAnd @itthese are the accounts.<TIE>.<TIE>.” thereby connecting it to the preceding? Rashi answers, in order that we should not mistakenly think this section refers specifically to the vessels of the @ITmishkon@it which is the subject of the section that immediately precedes it. For then we would ask: Why does the Torah count and mention the weights [of the vessels, if they were just mentioned]? For this reason it is written, “These are the accounts,” without the connecting “and,” to convey that our section refers also to the weights of the @ITcontributions@it to the @ITmishkon@it, not just to the vessels of the @ITmishkon. @it @d1Taken as “collateral” by being destroyed twice<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 You might ask: Is there not only one @hh<HEB>משכן@ee<ENG> extra, to be interpreted, for one is needed for the simple meaning? The answer is: Scripture altered the wording, saying @hb<HEB>ה@hhמשכן@ee<ENG> [and then simply] @hh<HEB>משכן@ee<ENG>, rather than writing either both with a @hh<HEB>ה@ee<ENG> or both without a @hh<HEB>ה@ee<ENG>. Perforce, the @hh<HEB>ה@ee<ENG> conveys “the” special @hh<HEB>משכן@ee<ENG>, i.e., the Eternal House, which is the @ITBeis Hamikdosh@it. If this is so [that it is referring to the @ITBeis Hamikdosh@it,] the question arises: why does Scripture refer to it as @hh<HEB>משכן@ee<ENG>? Perforce, [as Rashi explains]: “This is an allusion.<TIE>.<TIE>.” @d1It bears witness for Yisrael<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 But the fact that God gave them the [second] tablets does not bear witness. [Rashi knows this] because God could have given them [the tablets] in order not to actively reject them [from Torah observance]. Although they sinned, they were like apostate Jews, who are still called Jews. For it is written (Yehoshua 7:11), “Yisrael has sinned” — [interpreted in Sanhedrin 44a to mean] although one has sinned, he is still called Yisrael. (@ITRe”m@it) But it seems to me that [@ITRe”m’s @itexplanation is incorrect.] Those who sinned in the presence of witnesses, after being warned, were killed by the Levites. If there were witnesses but no warning, they died in the plague. And if there were neither witnesses nor a warning, they were examined in the manner that a @ITsotah@it is examined. Thus, whoever remained had not sinned. [Nevertheless, the tablets merely stated laws and obligations, whereas the @ITmishkon @itwas an open testimony of God’s love.] @d1To carry, to disassemble, and to set it up<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Is not the simple meaning of the verse that the work of the Levites was to make the accounts of the @ITmishkon@it, i.e., to count the vessels of the @ITmishkon@it? [But this cannot be, as the Levites were not involved at all with the construction of the @ITmishkon@it.] Thus Rashi explains: “.<TIE>.<TIE>.To carry, to disassemble.<TIE>.<TIE>.”<QC>
@p1[24]@p2<TIE>The @bo@ee@BImaneh@bo@it@BO associated with the Sanctuary was double.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: If the @ITmaneh@it was not double, and the @ITkikar@it was only sixty @ITmaneh@it, and a @ITmaneh@it equals twenty-five @ITselaim@it (@ITshekalim@it), then there would be 201 @ITkikar@it [of silver, yet the following verse says there was only half that amount]. This is because there were 301,775 whole @ITshekalim@it. And 1,500 @ITshekalim@it equal a @ITkikar@it. This is because ten @ITmaneh@it equal 250 @ITshekalim,@it and twenty @ITmaneh@it equal 500 @ITshekalim@it. According to this reckoning, sixty @ITmaneh@it equal 1,500 @ITshekalim@it. Thus, ten @ITkikar@it would equal 15,000 @ITshekalim@it, and one hundred @ITkikar@it would equal 150,000 @ITshekalim@it. So according to this reckoning there should be 201 @ITkikar@it. Rashi answers that the @ITmaneh@it of the Sanctuary was double the weight of the common @ITmaneh@it. Therefore, 3,000 @ITshekalim@it equal one @ITkikar@it, and one hundred @ITkikar@it equal 300,000 @ITshekalim@it. @d1It counts as units all the @bo@ee@BIshekalim<TIE>@bo@it@BO.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Explanation: if the @ITmaneh@it of the Sanctuary was double, it is understandable that 1,775 extra @ITshekalim@it are counted as units, as they did not add up to a @ITkikar@it. However, if we say the @ITmaneh@it was not double, then 1,500 @ITshekalim@it equal a @ITkikar@it. So why are 1,750 @ITshekalim@it counted [as units that did not add up to a @ITkikar@it]? The count should be 201 @ITkikar@it, plus 275 @ITshekalim@it that did not add up to a @ITkikar@it. Thus we must conclude that the @ITmaneh@it was double. [It comes out that] this, too, is a proof that the @ITmaneh@it of the sanctuary was double, making the @ITkikar@it [also] double. @p1[26]@p2<TIE>This is the name of the weight<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Does @hh<HEB>בקע@ee<ENG> not mean “splitting” throughout Scripture? But here, “splitting” does not fit as a meaning. @d1This was the count of the Israelites<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Surely, the count was higher. When they were counted in @ITseifer@it Bamidbar, there were 603,550 men. This was besides the Levites, who were not counted among the B’nei Yisrael. So regarding the donations to the @ITmishkon, @itwhere Israelites @ITand@it Levites gave, should there not be more? Therefore Rashi explains: “This was the count of the @ITIsraelites@it.” The @ITbeka@it per person was given only by the Israelites, [i.e., the non-Levites]. They had sinned by making the Calf, and they needed to give the donation for the @ITmishkon@it in order to atone for it. But the Levites, who did not sin, did not need to give. @ITRe”m@it offers a similar explanation.<QC>
@p1[28]@p2<TIE>Of the pillars with them<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: The verse seems to say that the caps of the @IThooks@it should be overlaid [with silver]! Why do they need this? The hooks were made completely of silver! [Rashi answers that the overlaying is for the pillars, not for the hooks.] Rashi adds the phrase, “With them,” to convey that the overlaying, the hooks and the bands — not just the hooks alone — were made with this [1,775 @ITshekalim@it of] silver. Rashi’s proof is that no silver was collected in the community census other than the one hundred @ITkikar@it from which the sockets were made, and the 1,775 [@ITshekalim@it] were less than a @ITkikar@it. [Thus, everything else must have been made from the 1,775 @ITshekalim@it].<QC>
@p1[28]@p2<TIE>The splendid turbans.@p3 Rashi needed to explain this so we will not mistakenly think that @hh<HEB>פארי@ee<ENG> means as it does in, “He will cut the branches (@hh<HEB>פארה@ee<ENG>) with terror” (@ITYeshaya @it10:33). Thus Rashi explains that it means, “The splendor of the turbans.” @hh<HEB>פארי@ee<ENG> is the plural of @hh<HEB>פאר@ee<ENG>, and means the same as @hh<HEB>פארים@ee<ENG> (splendors). Rashi says, “The splendid turbans,” because if the turbans were not splendid, there would not be any @hh<HEB>פארים@ee<ENG> [at all, since @hh<HEB>פארים@ee<ENG> is not an object that stands on its own] — and in that case it would not say @hh<HEB>פארי המגבעות@ee<ENG>.<QC>
@p1[32]@p2<TIE>The work.@p3 Rashi adds the phrase, “The work,” to inform us what B’nei Yisrael did. For it is written [just before], “Thus was @ITcompleted@it all the work of the @ITmishkon@it.” If so, they surely did the work [already], so what does it mean that they “did”? Therefore, Rashi explains, “The work.” The verse is conveying that the work they did was not any different, but rather they did it just as God commanded Moshe. @p1[33]@p2<TIE>For they were unable to erect it<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because otherwise, they would not have brought it [to Moshe] in pieces, since it is the way of craftsmen to erect a house and then to show what they built. Therefore Rashi explains, “For they were unable to erect it.” Rashi then answers a further question: Every time they traveled from place to place, they erected the @ITmishkon @it[themselves]. If so, why did they not do so now as well? Therefore Rashi explains, “Because Moshe did no work.<TIE>.<TIE>..” Thus the first time, it was erected through Moshe, of its own. And from then on, each time they traveled, it stood upright on its own, and through those who erected it. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) Here it is implied that even Moshe erected it [only] by a miracle. But in Shabbos 92a, Berachos 54b and Bechoros 44a, it is implied that since Moshe was ten @ITamohs@it tall, he therefore had the strength to erect it. See there.<QC>
@p1[43]@p2<TIE>May the pleasantness<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: What blessing did Moshe give them? Therefore Rashi explains that it was the blessing of @hh<HEB>ויהי נועם@ee<ENG>, which Moshe composed upon the completion of the building of the @ITmishkon@it. @d1This is one of the eleven Psalms<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 It seems that Rashi needed to bring this as proof [that Moshe blessed them with @hh<HEB>ויהי נועם@ee<ENG>] because [one opinion] in Sifra ch.1 says that they [the people] said @hh<HEB>ויהי נועם@ee<ENG> to Moshe. Similarly in Yalkut Shimoni, Pekudei 418. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it)<QC>
@p1[29]@p2<TIE>Moshe performed the service<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Accordingly,] when it is written here, “He burned the incense of spices upon it” (v. 27), it refers to Moshe, who burnt the incense during the seven days of the Installations before Aharon was anointed. And even on the eighth day, when Aharon began to burn incense, Moshe still burnt the incense [and brought the offerings] except for those which Aharon was commanded specifically for that day. Aharon and his sons brought [only] the offerings that they were commanded specifically for that day. @d1The daily burnt-offering.@p3 This, as opposed to the burnt-offering of Aharon and the burnt-offering of the people, which, on the eighth day, were offered by Aharon — not Moshe — as stated in @ITparshas@it Shemini. @d1The @BImincha@BO of the libations of the @BItamid<TIE>@BO.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 [Rashi knows this because] even though there are many [kinds of] meal-offerings, nevertheless since it is written, “And a meal-offering,” without specifying it further, it is speaking of the @ITmincha@it of the @ITtamid@it. If it was a @ITmincha@it that comes separately, it should be mentioned separately, [i.e., by name], since it is not subsidiary to another offering. Perforce, it is speaking of the @ITmincha@it of the @ITtamid,@it which is part of the @ITtamid@it burnt-offering as it says (Bamidbar 28:4—5), “Offer one lamb in the morning .<TIE>.<TIE>. and one tenth of an @ITeiphah@it of fine flour as a meal-offering<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>.”<QC>
@d1Their encampment is also called @HB<HEB>מסע@BO<TIE><ENG>.<TIE>.<TIE>.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: While Yisrael traveled, the cloud did not rest. Rather, B’nei Yisrael encamped only when the cloud rested, and in that place. Why does the verse say, “In all their travels,” implying that the cloud rested even while they traveled? Rashi answers, “Their encampment is also calle @hh<HEB>מסע@ee<ENG>.” Accordingly, the verse conveys, “In all their @ITencampments@it.” It does not mean literally, “In all their @ITtravels@it,” because then the cloud was not upon the @ITmishkon.@it<QC>
